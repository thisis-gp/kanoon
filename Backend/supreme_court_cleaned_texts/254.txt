SLP(C.) NO. 11757 OF 2022 

and the District Consumer Disputes Redressal 
Forum3 allowing the complaint of respondent 
No.1 and directing the Opposite Parties4 No.1 to 
5 therein to be jointly and severally liable to pay 
Rs.5 lakhs along with simple interest @ 18% p.a. from 21.05.2002 to 20.05.2012 with further 
interest @ 6% p.a. from 21.05.2012 onwards till 
realisation. Further, an amount of Rs.5,000/- 
was awarded towards compensation for mental 
agony and Rs.2,000/- towards costs to the 
respondent (the complainant). 
 
3. Brief facts giving rise to the present appeal are 
summarised hereunder: 
 
3.1. The respondent No.1 filed a complaint before 
the DCDRF, Dharwad, Karnataka, alleging 
that he had invested Rs. 5 Lakhs in the 
partnership firm M/s Annapurneshwari 
Cotton Co., Amargol, Hubli5 on 21.05.2002 
which was repayable after 120 months with 
interest @ 18% per annum. The respondent 
 
3 DCDRF 
4 OP 
5 The Firm 

SLP(C.) NO. 11757 OF 2022 

No.1 sought for premature payment but it 
was denied on the ground that the same 
would 
be 
paid 
upon 
maturity. 
The 
respondent No.1 waited for the maturity and 
he again claimed but still the payment was 
not made compelling him to issue a notice 
on 12.02.2014 calling upon the opposite 
parties to make the payment. However, as 
the payment was not made, a complaint was 
filed before the DCDRF alleging deficiency in 
service. 
 
3.2. Before the DCDRF, the respondent No.2 
herein was arrayed as OP No.1 as partner of 
the firm and the appellants herein were 
arrayed as respondent Nos.2 to 5 being the 
legal heirs of one Basavaraj Uppin (since 
deceased). The appellant No.1 is the widow 
of said Basavaraj Uppin whereas appellant 
Nos. 2 to 4 are his sons. Before the DCDRF, 
separate written versions were filed by OP 
No.1 and OP Nos.2 to 5. In his written 
statement OP No.1 admitted that he was 
partner in the firm along with OP Nos.2 to 5 

SLP(C.) NO. 11757 OF 2022 

(being 
the 
successors 
and 
legal 
representatives of the deceased Managing 
Partner Basavaraj Uppin) and the liability of 
OP No.1 was only to the extent of 10 percent. 
He also admitted that the firm was accepting 
finance from individuals and parties on 
interest basis in order to generate finance for 
the firm. He also admitted that the 
complainant had invested an amount of Rs.5 
lakhs and the said amount had not been 
paid. He also admitted that the Managing 
Partner Basavaraj Uppin, husband of OP 
No.2 and father of OP Nos.3 to 5 had died on 
13.03.2003 and after his death, the legal 
heirs being OP Nos. 2 to 5 had taken over 
the business of the firm and were dealing 
with the same by taking possession of all 
books of accounts, financial receipts and 
payments. 
 
3.3. He further stated that though there was no 
liability 
of 
OP 
No.1, 
he 
had 
been 
unnecessarily impleaded in order to get 
unlawful gains by the complainant. Thus, in 

SLP(C.) NO. 11757 OF 2022 

effect, he admitted his liability of one-tenth 
of the share. 
3.4. On the other hand, OP Nos. 2 to 5 contended 
that the complainant was not a ‘consumer’ 
and he had filed the instant complaint with 
wrong intention of recovering the amount 
illegally. They also contended that the 
complaint was not maintainable in view of 
section 63 of the Partnership Act, 1932, as 
there were only two partners and upon death 
of one of the partners, the firm came to be 
dissolved and as it was not in existence, the 
legal heirs of the deceased partner could not 
be impleaded as opposite parties for recovery 
of money from the firm. It was also stated 
that the complainant was one of the 
partners of the firm. They also denied the 
deposit of Rs.5 lakhs and that the receipt 
filed by the complainant was a concocted 
document. It was also submitted that they 
had not succeeded and inherited any assets 
or liabilities of the firm as such they had no 
liability to pay the same. Further that there 
was no ‘deficiency in service’ and no cause 

SLP(C.) NO. 11757 OF 2022 

of action arose for filing of complaint before 
the DCDRF, the complaint thus deserves to 
be rejected. 
 
3.5. The DCDRF, vide order dated 16.05.2014, 
allowed the complaint directing OP Nos.1 to 
5 therein to pay the sum of Rs.5 lakhs with 
18% simple interest per annum from 
21.05.2002 to 20.05.2012 and thereafter 
with simple interest @ 9% per annum from 
21.05.2012 till realization, along with 
compensation of Rs.2,000/- and costs of 
Rs.1,000/-. 
 
3.6. Aggrieved, present appellant Nos.1 to 4 filed 
an appeal before the SCDRC, Bangalore, 
registered as Appeal No.952 of 2014. The 
said appeal was allowed by order dated 
12.03.2014 and the matter was remanded. 
The order passed by DCDRF was set aside 
on the ground of denial of opportunity to the 
opposite parties and the matter was remitted 
back for a fresh decision. 

SLP(C.) NO. 11757 OF 2022 

3.7. The DCDRF, by order dated 29.04.2016, 
again allowed the complaint with the same 
terms as its previous order. The appellants 
herein again preferred an appeal before the 
SCDRC, Bangalore registered as Appeal 
no.1707 of 2016 which again came to be 
allowed vide order dated 22.07.2019, and 
the matter was again remanded to the 
DCDRF to reconsider the issue with regard 
to maintainability of the complaint. 
 
3.8. The DCDRF, by order dated 13.01.2021, 
again allowed the complaint awarding relief 
as stated in the opening paragraph. The 
appeal preferred by the appellants herein 
before the SCDRC, being Appeal No.207 of 
2021, came to be dismissed by order dated 
23.09.2021. Aggrieved by the same, the 
appellants herein preferred a Revision 
Petition before the NCDRC which came to be 
dismissed by the impugned order giving rise 
to the present appeal. 

SLP(C.) NO. 11757 OF 2022 

4. Learned counsel for the appellants made the 
following submissions. 
4.1. It is the specific case of the appellants that 
they were never a part of the partnership 
firm either as partners or in any other 
capacity. By an unregistered deed of 
partnership dated 16.02.1994, the firm was 
constituted which included the complainant 
(respondent No.1), husband and father of 
the appellants, and three others. 
4.2. Later on, by another unregistered deed of 
partnership, the firm was re-constituted 
wherein three partners have resigned from 
the firm which included the complainant -
respondent No.1. The surviving partners 
were the husband of appellant No.1 and 
father of appellant Nos.2 to 4 and the 
respondent No.2 herein. 
4.3. Subsequently, the registered partnership 
deed came into force on 27.05.1996, which 
included all the five partners who were part 
of the first unregistered partnership deed 
dated 
16.02.1994. 
It 
included 
the 
complainant-respondent as partner No.2. 

SLP(C.) NO. 11757 OF 2022 

Thus, the complainant-respondent No.1 was 
a partner in the firm as per the registered 
deed dated 27.05.1996. 
4.4. All the three partnership deeds, the two 
unregistered ones and third the registered 
one are filed as Annexures P1, P2 and P3 
respectively. The fact as stated by the 
appellants with respect to the complainant-
respondent No.1 being a partner to the firm 
is clearly borne out from the reading of the 
said documents. 
4.5. According to the appellants, once the 
complainant himself was a partner as per 
the registered partnership deed dated 
27.05.1996, he could not have maintained 
the complaint for settling the dispute with 
respect to the partnership firm by way of a 
complaint under the Consumer Protection 
Act, 19866. 
4.6. It was also submitted that the dispute, being 
purely commercial in nature, appropriate 
remedy, if any, available to the complainant-
 
6 The 1986 Act 

SLP(C.) NO. 11757 OF 2022 

respondent No.1 was before the Civil Court 
and not by way of alleging ‘deficiency in 
service’ and filing a complaint under the 
1986 Act. 
4.7. It was next submitted that the legal heirs of 
the deceased partner of a registered firm 
could not be impleaded as opposite parties 
in a complaint for recovery of any investment 
or for any liability of the firm of which their 
husband/father was a partner. 
4.8. It is submitted that not only the DCDRF, the 
SCDRC but also the NCDRC committed 
serious error of law in entertaining the 
complaint and allowing the same. 
 
5. On the other hand, learned counsel for the 
respondent No.1, the contesting respondent, 
made the following submissions: 
5.1. That the present appeal is not maintainable 
in view of the recent judgment of this Court 
in the case of Universal Sompo General 
Insurance Company Ltd. vs. Suresh 
Chand Jain and Another7 wherein this 
 
7 (2023) SCC Online SC 877 

SLP(C.) NO. 11757 OF 2022 

Court has held that the remedy of Article 
226 of the Constitution before the High 
Court would be available to an aggrieved 
party where the NCDRC has decided an 
appeal or a revision but no such remedy 
would be available where it was an original 
complaint before the NCDRC. The present 
petition should be dismissed on the ground 
of alternative remedy. 
5.2. It was next submitted that the contention of 
the appellants with respect to the registered 
partnership deed dated 27.05.1996 would 
not be of any help to the appellants in as 
much 
as 
there 
was 
an 
intervening 
unregistered partnership of 13.09.1994 and 
therefore, no reliance can be placed on the 
registered partnership deed. 
5.3. It was next submitted that despite legal 
notice, the appellants having refused to 
return 
the 
invested 
amount, 
clearly 
amounted to deficiency in service and 
therefore, the complaint was maintainable. 
It was also the case of respondent No.1 that 
the appellants herein inherited the estate of 

SLP(C.) NO. 11757 OF 2022 

the Managing Partner Basavaraj Uppin, and 
hence cannot escape the liability of making 
the payment due to the respondent No.1. 
6. We need not go into other details of the 
arguments raised by the parties. In our 
considered opinion, once there was a registered 
partnership deed dated 27.05.1996, there is no 
further document placed on record by the 
complainant-respondent 
No.1 
regarding 
dissolution of the said registered deed which 
continued till the time when the investment was 
made by the complainant respondent No.1 on 
21.05.2002 
and 
hence 
the 
complainant 
respondent No.1 would be deemed to be partner 
of the firm. It is only upon the death of the 
Managing Partner Basavaraj Uppin in March 
2003, that the status of the firm would cease to 
exist or would stand dissolved. 
7. Secondly, 
the 
investment 
made 
by 
the 
respondent No.1 complainant was for deriving 
benefit by getting an interest on the same at the 
rate of 18 % per annum, therefore, it would be 
an investment for profit/gain. It was a 
commercial transaction and therefore also 

SLP(C.) NO. 11757 OF 2022 

would be outside the purview of the 1986 Act. 
Commercial disputes cannot be decided in 
summary proceeding under the 1986 Act but 
the appropriate remedy for recovery of the said 
amount, if any, admissible to the complainant-
respondent No.1, would be before the Civil 
Court. 
The 
complaint 
was 
thus 
not 
maintainable. 
8. Thirdly, there was no evidence on record to show 
that a fresh partnership deed was executed 
reconstituting the firm in which the present 
appellants had become partners so as to take 
upon themselves the assets and liabilities of the 
firm. The law is well settled that legal heirs of a 
deceased partner do not become liable for any 
liability of the firm upon the death of the 
partner. 
9. The arguments of the respondents that the 
appellants 
had 
alternative 
remedy 
of 
approaching the High Court under Article 226 of 
the Constitution is of no avail in as much as this 
Court in Universal Sompo General Insurance 
(supra) has not issued any directions for the 
pending matters being either dismissed on this 

SLP(C.) NO. 11757 OF 2022 

ground or being transferred to the High Court. 
It would apply prospectively for fresh matters 
coming up before this Court after the said 
judgment. 
10. For all the reasons recorded above, we are of the 
view that the District Forum, the State and the 
National Commissions fell in error in allowing 
the complaint and upholding it in appeal and 
revision. The appeal is accordingly allowed. The 
impugned orders are set aside and the 
complaint is dismissed. 
11. We however, leave it open for the respondent 
No.1 complainant to avail such other remedy as 
may be available under law before any 
Competent Forum.
