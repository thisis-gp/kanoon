praying for the following reliefs: 
“i) direct the respondents to reinstate 
the appellant/applicant into service as 
Civil Judge with all consequential 
benefits in view of the order dated 
20.04.2022 passed by this Hon’ble

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

ii) Pass any other order or orders 
as this Hon’ble Court may deem fit 
and proper in the interest of 
justice.” 
 
2. Before we deal with the aforesaid application, it 
would be necessary to refer to the relevant facts 
giving rise to the present application: 
2.1. The appellant was a judicial officer with the 
Punjab Civil Services (Judicial Branch) since 
2006. Under the Punjab Civil Services (General 
and Common Conditions of Service) Rules, 1994, 
period of probation under Rule 7 thereof is for 
three years which was to continue till December 
2009. At the time of joining the service in 
December 2006, the appellant was already 
married, however, the marriage was not going very 
smoothly and quite often there would be disputes 
between the appellant and his wife. In order to 
avoid the situation getting worse, the appellant left 
the official accommodation and shifted to a private 
accommodation. His wife and mother-in-law 
continued to reside in the official accommodation. 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

Sometime in November/December 2008, the wife 
of the appellant made a complaint as a result of 
which the appellant was called by not only the 
District Judge but also the Administrative Judge 
concerned in December 2008 and February 2009. 
The appellant explained his position and clarified 
why he was residing in a private accommodation. 
No written explanation was called from the 
appellant regarding the complaint made by his 
wife at that stage. 
 
2.2. It was only vide communication dated 
06.04.2009, that the appellant was called upon to 
answer as to whether he was residing in the official 
accommodation. 
Immediately, 
the 
appellant 
responded vide letter dated 07.04.2009 and a 
further letter dated 20.04.2009 stating that he had 
moved 
out 
of 
his 
official 
accommodation 
apprehending danger to his life and to avoid any 
undue incident and was residing with his 
maternal uncle. On 22.04.2009, the appellant filed 
a petition seeking a decree of divorce. At the same 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

time, the appellant -mother-in-law, who was also 
a government servant working as Principal of a 
Government College at Faridkot, met the District 
and Sessions Judge and complained about the 
appellant with regard to the dispute with his wife. 
The District and Sessions Judge, Faridkot 
forwarded his report on 20.05.2009 to the 
Registrar General of the High Court mentioning 
the matrimonial dispute of the appellant. 
 
2.3. In November 2009, reports were called 
regarding the review of work of all judicial officers 
on probation by the Committee of Judges In 
Charge of review of work and conduct of the 
probationers. The report is said to have been sent 
by the District and Sessions Judge on 27.11.2009 
stating that the work and conduct of the appellant 
was satisfactory. Thereafter, it appears that the 
Registrar General of the High Court again wrote to 
the District and Sessions Judge, Faridkot to send 
a detailed report regarding the appellant in 
particular, concerning the allegations against the 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

appellant of having an illicit relationship with a 
lady judicial officer. The Administrative Judge on 
the same day i.e. 01.12.2009, gave his remarks 
based on the report of the District and Sessions 
Judge dated 20.05.2009. The Committee of the 
Judges overseeing the work and conduct of the 
probationers, gave its opinion that the appellant 
was not fit to continue in service and further, 
decided that the lady judicial officer, with whom 
the appellant was said to be having a relationship, 
be identified and she may also be confronted with 
the said allegations. 
 
2.4. On 02.12.2009, the District and Sessions 
Judge after recording the statement of the 
appellant’s wife and the alleged lady judicial 
officer, forwarded his report in which it was stated 
that wife of the appellant had clearly alleged that 
her husband was having an illicit relationship with 
a lady judicial officer who was then posted at 
Phagwada because of which the appellant used to 
harass his wife. The Committee of Judges 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

overseeing 
the 
work 
and 
conduct 
of 
the 
probationers on 04.12.2009 recommended that 
the appellant and also the lady judicial officer were 
not fit to be retained in the service. 
 
2.5. The Full Court of the High Court in its meeting 
dated 07.12.2009 accepted the report of the 
Committee of Judges dated 04.12.2009 and 
resolved that the services of not only the appellant 
but also the lady judicial officer were to be 
terminated by an order of Termination Simpliciter. 
The work was withdrawn from the appellant on 
07.12.2009. The resolution of the Full Court dated 
07.12.2009 was accepted by the State of Punjab 
and an order was passed on 17.12.2009 
dispensing with the services of the appellant. On 
the same day, another order was passed by the 
State of Punjab dispensing the services of the lady 
judicial officer. 
 
2.6. Aggrieved by the said termination, the 
appellant filed CWP No.9003 of 2010 before the 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

High Court. Similarly, the lady judicial officer filed 
a separate petition registered as CWP No.8250 of 
2010 challenging her termination. The Division 
Bench of the High Court, vide judgment and order 
dated 25.10.2018, dismissed the writ petition of 
the appellant. On the very next day i.e., 
26.10.2018, the same Division Bench of the High 
Court allowed the writ petition of the lady judicial 
officer, set aside the termination order, after 
disbelieving 
the 
allegations 
of 
an 
illicit 
relationship. 
 
2.7. The High Court of Punjab and Haryana 
preferred SLP ( assailing the 
correctness of the judgment dated 26.10.2018 
passed in the case of the lady judicial officer which 
came to be dismissed vide order dated 01.07.2019. 
Thereafter, the lady judicial officer was reinstated 
and is working. 
 
2.8. The appellant preferred SLP (Civil) 33435 of 
2018 assailing the correctness of the judgment 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

dated 25.10.2018 passed by the High Court 
dismissing the writ petition. The SLP filed by the 
appellant was taken up on 03.03.2022 and after 
hearing the parties to some extent, the matter was 
adjourned. However, the Court required the 
counsel for the High Court of Punjab and Haryana 
to obtain further instructions in the matter after 
orally observing that it was prima facie of the view 
that the appellant also deserves to be reinstated in 
service. 
 
2.9. The counsel for the High Court of Punjab and 
Haryana communicated the observations made by 
this Court to the Registrar General, vide 
communication dated 04.03.2022. However, the 
Registrar General of the High Court replied vide 
communication 
dated 
11.03.2022 
with 
the 
instructions that the matter may be argued on 
merits. 
 
2.10. On 20.04.2022, when the matter came up 
before the Court, after hearing the learned senior 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

counsel for the parties, this Court granted leave 
and allowed the appeal after setting aside the 
impugned judgment of the High Court dated 
25.10.2018 and the Termination Order dated 
17.12.2009. It further requested the Full Court of 
the High Court to reconsider the matter. The order 
dated 20.04.2022 is reproduced below: 
“Leave granted. 
 
We have heard Mr. P.S.Patwalia, 
learned senior counsel for the appellant 
and Mr. Nidhesh Gupta, learned senior 
counsel for the respondent-High Court 
of Punjab and Haryana and perused the 
relevant material placed on record. 
 
We are of the considered view that 
the Full Court of the High Court of 
Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh 
needs to reconsider this matter. 
 
Therefore, the impugned order 
dated 25th October, 2018 and the order 
passed by the Principal Secretary to 
Government, Punjab, Department of 
Home Affairs and Justice on 17th 
December, 

terminating 
the 
services of the appellant herein are set 
aside. 
 
We, however, request the Full 
Court of the High Court of Punjab and 
Haryana to reconsider the matter 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

without being influenced by any of the 
observations made by the Division 
Bench of the High Court in the 
impugned order. 
 
The appeal accordingly stands 
disposed of in terms aforesaid.” 
 
2.11. No consequential orders were passed by the 
State after the order dated 20.04.2022 whereby 
the termination order of the appellant dated 
17.12.2009 passed by the State Government was 
set aside. The High Court however, took up the 
matter on the administrative side. The Full Court 
in its meeting dated 16.09.2022 referred the 
matter 
to 
the 
Recruitment 
and 
Promotion 
Committee (RPC). Seven months thereafter, the 
RPC 
reiterated 
its 
earlier 
decision 
dated 
04.12.2009, relying upon the note of the 
Administrative Judge dated 01.12.2009 and also 
the report of the District and Sessions Judge dated 
20.05.2009. The recommendation of the RPC 
dated 12.04.2023 is reproduced hereunder: 
“...Reconsideration of Hon'ble Full Court 
decision dated 07.12.2009 regarding 
dispensing with the services of Sh. 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

Anantdeep Singh, former member of 
P.C.S. (J.B.), in view of judgment dated 
20.04.2022 passed by Hon'ble Supreme 
Court in the Special Leave Petition (Civil) 
No.33435 of 2018 titled as "Anantdeep 
Singh Vs. The High Court of Punjab and 
Haryana at Chandigarh & Anr." 
 
Sh. Anantdeep Singh, had joined P.C.S. 
(J.B.) 
on 
12.12.2006. 
On 
the 
recommendation of this Court, his 
services were dispensed with, during 
probation, vide Punjab Government 
order dated 17.12.2009. The officer 
relinquished charge on 24.12.2009. The 
CWP No.9003 of 2010 filed by him, 
against the order dated 17.12.2009 of 
Punjab Government, was dismissed by 
Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court. vide 
judgment 
dated 
25.10.2018. 
Thereafter, Sh. Anantdeep Singh had 
filed SLP ( titled 
as "Sh. Anantdeep Singh vs. the High 
Court of Punjab and Haryana at 
Chandigarh and Another" against the 
judgment dated 25.10.2018 of this 
Court. While disposing of the appeal, 
Hon'ble Supreme Court, vide judgment 
dated 20.4.2022, had set aside the 
impugned order dated 25th October 
2018 and the order passed by the 
Principal Secretary to Government, 
Punjab, Department of Home Affairs 
and Justice on l7th December, 2009 
terminating the services of the appellant 
and requested the Full Court of this 
Court to reconsider the matter. 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

The matter was reconsidered by Hon'ble 
Full Court in its meeting held on 
16.09.2022 and it was resolved that the 
matter 
be 
referred 
to 
Hon'ble 
Recruitment and Promotion Committee 
(Subordinate 
Judicial 
Services) 
for 
examining the same and report. After 
thoroughly re-examining the matter in 
entirety particularly the observations of 
the 
then 
Administrative 
Judge 
contained in note dated 01.12.2009 as 
also the report of District and Sessions 
Judge dated 20.05.2009 and the fact 
that the officer was merely a probationer 
and the decision was taken within the 
prescribed period, at this stage the 
Committee is not in a position to come 
to any different conclusion on the basis 
of material on record. Thus, the 
Committee reiterates its earlier decision 
dated 04.12.2009.” 
 
2.12. As the matter was further delayed and no 
decision was being taken and that the appellant 
had not been taken back in service despite the 
termination order having been set aside, the 
appellant filed M.A. No.655 of 2023, which was 
disposed of by order dated 04.05.2023, requesting 
the Full Court of the High Court to decide the 
matter within three months. It was thereafter that 
the Full Court of the High Court in its meeting 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

dated 03.08.2023 resolved to reiterate its earlier 
decision dated 07.12.2009, terminating the 
services of the appellant. 
 
2.13. The appellant filed a petition before this 
Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India 
registered as W.P.( which was 
allowed to be withdrawn with liberty to explore 
other legal options which may be available to move 
before 
the 
High 
Court 
vide 
order 
dated 
22.09.2023. 
The 
said 
order 
is 
reproduced 
hereunder: 
“Mr. P.S. Patwalia, learned senior 
counsel does not wish to press this writ 
petition 
under 
Article 

of 
the 
Constitution and would explore other 
legal options which may be available to 
move the High Court. 
 
Taking 
note 
of 
the 
above 
submission 
of 
the 
learned 
senior 
counsel, 
the 
writ 
petition 
stands 
dismissed as not pressed, reserving the 
liberty as aforesaid.” 
 
2.14. The appellant in the meantime approached 
the High Court under Right to Information Act, 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

2005 requesting for a copy of the letter dated 
04.03.2022 written by the counsel for the High 
Court to the Registrar General. This letter was 
made available on 11.10.2023. It was thereafter 
that the present M.A. was filed on 31.10.2023. 
 
2.15. During the pendency of the said M.A. and 
when the State of Punjab was also called upon to 
be served with the copy of M.A., vide order dated 
29.01.2024 and with the matter being listed on 
several occasions, the State of Punjab passed an 
order dated 02.04.2024 terminating the services of 
the 
appellant 
with 
retrospective 
effect 
i.e. 
17.12.2009. The said order dated 02.04.2024 has 
been filed along with I.A. No.110912 of 2024. 
 
3. It is on the above set of facts that we have heard 
Shri P.S. Patwalia, learned senior counsel 
appearing for the appellant, Shri Nidhesh Gupta, 
learned senior counsel appearing for High Court of 
Punjab and Haryana and Shri Gaurav Dhama, 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

learned Additional Advocate General for the State 
of Punjab. 
 
4. The submissions advanced by Shri P.S. Patwalia 
are to the effect that the judgment and order of 
this Court dated 20.04.2022 has not been 
complied 
with 
by 
the 
respondents. 
The 
respondents ought to have taken back the 
appellant in service and thereafter proceeded to 
take the decision as directed by this Court. 
Further it was submitted that it took almost two 
years for the respondents to take a fresh decision. 
During this period, the appellant has neither been 
reinstated in service nor been paid any salary, no 
arrears have been paid from 17.12.2009, the date 
of the earlier termination order even though the 
same had been set aside by this Court. 
 
5. It was also submitted by Mr. P.S. Patwalia that this 
Court in all its humility had not quashed the 
decision of the Full Court but having given serious 
thought to it, had clearly observed that this Court 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

was of the considered view that the Full Court of 
the High Court of Punjab and Haryana needs to 
reconsider this matter which in itself is a clear 
indication that this Court had expressed its view 
on the resolution of the Full Court regarding 
termination of the appellant’s service to be not 
sustainable. It was thereafter that this Court had 
set aside the judgment of the High Court dated 
25.10.2018 and the Termination order dated 
17.12.2009. 
 
6. It is also submitted on behalf of the appellant that 
the RPC and also the Full Court of the High Court 
have simply reiterated their earlier resolutions and 
as such there has been no reconsideration of the 
matter, the resolutions placed on record are also 
non-speaking. 
 
7. It is also the submission of Mr. Patwalia that the 
complaint against the appellant was given by his 
wife and his mother-in-law. The entire contents of 
the reports submitted by the District and Sessions 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

Judge and also the Administration Judge and the 
Review Committee are based on the complaint 
made by the wife and his mother-in-law. No 
independent enquiry was conducted, nor any 
show cause notice was issued to the appellant 
calling upon him to give a response to the 
complaint made by his wife and mother-in-law. 
 
8. It was also submitted that the main allegations 
made by the wife and mother-in-law relates to the 
appellant carrying on an illicit relationship with 
the lady judicial officer. The other complaints 
alleged were of residing outside the official 
accommodation and of using a private car, which 
did not belong to him. It was also alleged in the 
complaint that the appellant had threatened and 
assaulted his wife. All the other allegations apart 
from the main allegations of illicit relationship 
with the lady judicial officer, were linked to the 
aforesaid main allegation. 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

9. The High Court, on the judicial side in the case of 
the lady judicial officer, found that there was not 
even any remote evidence regarding their illicit 
relationship and that the statement of the wife 
could not be taken as a gospel truth to throw the 
said lady judicial officer out of service, and it was 
found to be totally unjust. The findings recorded 
by the High Court in the judgment dated 
26.10.2018 with respect to the illicit relationship 
is reproduced hereunder: 
“At the outset, we are at a loss to find 
even remote evidence about any illicit 
relationship from the above except use 
of the word “illicit relations”. That apart, 
her mere statement/perception like a 
gospel truth could not be acted upon to 
throw the appellant out of service. That 
was totally unjust” 
 
10. 
It was submitted that once the complaint of 
the wife and mother-in-law of the appellant were 
not found to be credible and truthful with respect 
to the allegations of an illicit relationship, any 
reliance placed upon the said complaints with 
respect to minor allegations of using a private car 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

not belonging to the appellant and of threatening 
and assaulting cannot be relied upon without 
there being any further corroboration. No reliance 
can be placed on the said complaints at all. 
 
11. 
Mr. Patwalia thus submitted that this Court 
may not only allow the M.A. as prayed but may 
also consider setting aside the Termination order 
now passed on 02.04.2024 with retrospective 
effect from 17.12.2009 and reinstate the appellant 
back in service with full back wages and all 
consequential benefits. 
 
12. 
It is also submitted that there could not have 
been any backdating of the Termination order 
being made effective from a previous date. The 
Termination order can be effective only from the 
date it is served on the employee. As such the 
order dated 02.04.2024 deserves to be quashed. 
 
13. 
Mr. Patwalia has relied upon the judgment of 
this Court in State Bank of Patiala and another 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

vs. Ramniwas Bansal (dead) through Lrs.1; for 
the proposition that the dismissal order cannot be 
made with retrospective effect, and it would only 
have prospective effect. 
14. 
Before we deal with the submissions of Mr. 
Nidhesh Gupta, learned senior counsel appearing 
for the High Court, we may mention the response 
of the State as put forth by Additional Advocate 
General. According to Mr. Gaurav Dhama the 
State did not pass any consequential order after 
the order dated 20.04.2022. He further submitted 
that the order dated 02.04.2024 has been passed 
as per the resolution of the Full Court of the High 
Court. He, however, did not address the issue as 
to whether the termination order could have been 
passed making it effective from an earlier date. 
 
15. 
Mr. Nidhesh Gupta, learned senior counsel 
appearing for the High Court justified not only the 
subsequent compliance affected by the High Court 
 
1 (2014) 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

and also the resolution of the Full Court of the 
High Court to terminate the service of the 
appellant w.e.f. the earlier date and also the 
termination order issued by the State Government 
on 02.04.2024. On a specific query as to how the 
High Court could have proceeded against an 
officer who was not taken into service by passing 
a resolution of terminating the services from the 
previous date, he has sought to mix the issue by 
submitting that as the appellant was a probationer 
and his services were terminated as a probationer, 
if he was taken back in service during the period, 
the High Court was to take a fresh decision as 
required by this Court, then he would be treated 
as a regular employee because the period of 
probation under the Rules is only for a limited 
period of maximum three years and not beyond. 
 
16. 
Mr. Gupta also had no answer as to why the 
High Court took one and half years to take the 
decision. He however expressed his inability to 
explain the delay on the part of the State for issue 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

of termination order after eight months of the 
resolution of the Full Court of the High Court. Mr. 
Gupta further addressed the Court raising the 
point that any preliminary enquiry conducted to 
ascertain the suitability of a probationer and if 
termination follows without giving an opportunity, 
it will not be bad and will be a case of motive. In 
effect, the submission is that the probationer’s 
service could be dispensed with without holding a 
formal enquiry or giving an opportunity to the 
probationer and the employer was well within his 
right to dispense the service of the probationer by 
conducting the preliminary enquiry to ascertain 
the suitability. In this connection, he has placed 
reliance upon the following judgments: 
i.State of Punjab vs. Balbir Singh2; 
ii.State of Punjab and others vs. Sukhwinder 
Singh3; 
 
2 (2004) 
3 (2005) 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

iii.State of Punjab and others vs. Rajesh 
Kumar4; 
iv. Bishan Lal Gupta vs. State of Haryana5; 
v.State of Punjab vs. Sukh Raj Bahadur6; and 
vi.High Court of Patna vs. Pandey Madan 
Mohan7. 
 
17. 
Mr. Gupta, while further addressing on 
merits, submitted that it was not just the 
allegation of having illicit relationship with lady 
judicial officer but there were other very serious 
allegations which were unbecoming of a judicial 
officer and since the appellant was a probationer, 
the Full Court of the High Court found him 
unsuitable 
for 
continuing 
in 
service 
and 
accordingly he was dismissed from the service. 
 
18. 
He further submitted that in the case of the 
lady judicial officer whose petition was allowed by 
 
4 (2006) 
5 (1978) 
6 (1968) 
7 (1997) 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

the High Court and has since been reinstated to 
the service, the only allegation against the said 
lady judicial officer was of carrying on an illicit 
relationship with the appellant which the High 
Court found was without any basis or supporting 
material. According to him, in the present case, 
the High Court in the judgment dated 25.10.2018 
had clearly held that it was omitting the 
allegations of illicit relation with the lady judicial 
officer from consideration and further relied upon 
other allegations of misconduct or unsuitability 
against the appellant and therefore, the appellant 
cannot claim any advantage or benefit from the 
judgment in the case of the lady judicial officer. 
19. 
Having 
considered 
the 
submissions 
advanced, at the outset, we make it clear that we 
are not entering into the merits of the matter i.e., 
the reconsideration by the High Court in the Full 
Court meeting held on 03.08.2023 and the 
termination letter issued by the State on 
02.04.2024. These orders could be tested before 
the High Court by way of a fresh writ petition to be 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

filed by the appellant and such liberty having been 
granted by this Court in the writ petition under 
Article 32 of the Constitution of India filed by the 
appellant which was withdrawn on 22.09.2023. 
For the above reason, the case laws relied upon by 
Mr. Gupta are not being dealt with nor are we 
dealing with the case laws relied upon by Mr. 
Patwalia. 
20. 
We are only dealing with the M.A. No.267 of 
2024 where the appellant has prayed that he 
should be reinstated into service as Civil Judge 
with all consequential benefits in view of the order 
dated 20.04.2022 passed by this Court allowing 
the appeal. 
21. 
Once the termination order is set aside and 
judgment of the High Court dismissing the writ 
petition challenging the said termination order has 
also been set aside, the natural consequence is 
that the employee should be taken back in service 
and thereafter proceeded with as per the 
directions. Once the termination order is set aside 
then the employee is deemed to be in service. We 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

find no justification in the inaction of the High 
Court and also the State in not taking back the 
appellant into service after the order dated 
20.04.2022. No decision was taken either by the 
High Court or by the State of taking back the 
appellant into service and no decision was made 
regarding the back wages from the date the 
termination order had been passed till the date of 
reinstatement which should be the date of the 
judgment of this Court. In any case, the appellant 
was entitled to salary from the date of judgment 
dated 20.04.2022 till fresh termination order was 
passed on 02.04.2024. The appellant would thus 
be entitled to full salary for the above period to be 
calculated with all benefits admissible treating the 
appellant to be in continuous service. 
22. 
Insofar as the period from 18.12.2009 i.e., 
after the termination order of 17.12.2009 was 
passed till 19.04.2022 the date prior to the 
judgment and order of this Court, we are of the 
view that ends of justice would be served by 
directing that the appellant would be entitled to 50 

M.A. NO.267 OF 2024 IN C.A.NO.3082 OF 2022 

percent of the back wages treating him to be in 
service continuously. Such back wages to be 
calculated with all benefits admissible under law 
to the appellant as if he was in service. 
23. 
Insofar as the challenge to the resolution of 
the Full Court of the High Court dated 03.08.2023 
and termination order dated 02.04.2024 is 
concerned, the appellant would be at liberty to 
challenge the same by way of a writ petition before 
the High Court which may be decided on its own 
merits totally uninfluenced by any observations 
made in this order. The facts and observations 
made are only with respect to the disposal of the 
M.A. No.267 of 2024. 
24. 
M.A. stands disposed of accordingly.
