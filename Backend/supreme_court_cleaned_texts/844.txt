IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA 
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 

STATE BANK OF INDIA & ORS. 

 APPELLANT(S) 
 
VERSUS 
 
NAVIN KUMAR SINHA 

 RESPONDENT(S) 

JUDGMENT 
 
UJJAL BHUYAN, J. 

Heard learned counsel for the parties. 
2. 
 
This appeal by special leave is directed against the 
judgment and order dated 11.02.2020 passed by a Division 
Bench of the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi (briefly ‘the High 
Court’ hereinafter) in LPA No. 505 of 2016. Appellants are the 
State Bank of India and its officers. 
2.1. 
Respondent, an officer of the State Bank of India (SBI), 
was subjected to a disciplinary proceeding following which the 
penalty of dismissal from service was imposed on him. 
Departmental appeal filed by the respondent against the 

dismissal order was rejected by the appellate authority; so also 
the petition for review. Respondent filed a writ petition before the 
High Court challenging the order of penalty as upheld by the 
appellate authority and the reviewing authority. Learned Single 
Judge allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of penalty 
on the ground that the disciplinary proceeding was initiated after 
superannuation of the respondent including the extended period 
of service. Therefore, such disciplinary proceeding was held to be 
void ab initio and the consequential order of penalty set aside with 
a further direction to the appellants to pay the retiral and other 
dues of the respondent. 
2.2. 
Appeal filed by the appellants was also dismissed by a 
Division Bench of the High Court. Against such dismissal of the 
letters patent appeal, 
was filed by the appellants. This Court by order dated 16.10.2020 
had issued notice. As an interim measure, it was directed that the 
contempt proceedings stated to have been initiated by the 
respondent against the appellants before the High Court be 
deferred. The matter was finally heard on 23.01.2024 when leave 
was granted. 

3. 
 
Before proceeding further, it would be appropriate to 
briefly encapsulate the relevant facts so as to have a proper 
perspective of the lis. 
4. 
 
Respondent was appointed as clerk typist in the SBI on 
08.06.1973. He was promoted from time to time. On completion 
of 30 years of service, respondent was due to superannuate on 
26.12.2003 
as 
per 
the 
State 
Bank 
of 
India 
Officers’ 
(Determination of Terms and Conditions of Service) Order, 1979. 
4.1. 
However, by order dated 05.08.2003 issued by the 
competent authority, respondent was given extension of service 
from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. 
5. 
 
On 18.08.2009, a notice was issued to the respondent 
by the appellant SBI calling for his explanation as to why 
disciplinary action should not be initiated against him for 
violating instructions of SBI. The allegations highlighted in the 
notice mostly pertained to sanctioning of loans by the respondent 
in favour of his relatives in deviation of banking norms and 
missing of documents related to sanctioning of the loans. 
6. 
 
On 
21.08.2009, 
respondent 
was 
placed 
under 
suspension. 

7. 
 
Respondent submitted reply dated 27.10.2009 to the 
notice dated 18.08.2009. However, it appears that the 
disciplinary authority did not accept such reply of the respondent. 
7.1. 
Thereafter on 18.03.2011, appellants decided to 
initiate disciplinary proceeding against the respondent in terms 
of Rule 68(1) of the State Bank of India Officers’ Service Rules, 
1992 (for short ‘the Service Rules’ hereinafter). Deputy General 
Manager (Operations and Credit), NW-II, Jharkhand acting as the 
disciplinary authority issued show cause notice dated 18.03.2011 
enclosing therewith articles of charges supported by a statement 
of allegations and a list of documents on the basis of which the 
charges were framed. The charges were the same as the 
allegations in the previous notice issued on 18.08.2009. 
Respondent was called upon to submit his written statement of 
defence within the prescribed period. It may be mentioned that 
the disciplinary authority had appointed an enquiry authority to 
conduct the enquiry against the respondent. On 29.11.2011, 
respondent submitted his defence brief denying all the allegations 
totalling 20. 
7.2. 
Enquiry proceeding started on 24.05.2011 and 
concluded on 06.09.2011. Thereafter on 08.12.2011, the enquiry 

officer submitted the enquiry report to the disciplinary authority. 
Out of the 20 allegations, the enquiry officer held that 16 were 
proved; 3 were partly proved; and one not proved. The disciplinary 
authority vide the forwarding letter dated 17.12.2011 forwarded 
a copy of the enquiry report to the respondent calling upon him 
to respond thereto within 15 days from the date of receipt of the 
report. 
7.3. 
Respondent submitted his reply to the disciplinary 
authority on 15.01.2012 pointing out various flaws in the enquiry 
report and requesting the said authority to drop the proceeding. 
7.4. 
The disciplinary authority, however, passed order 
dated 07.03.2012 imposing the penalty of dismissal from service 
on the respondent. Respondent preferred an appeal against the 
order of penalty. However, by order dated 26.10.2012, the appeal 
of the respondent was dismissed. It was thereafter that 
respondent preferred a review petition which also came to be 
dismissed by the reviewing authority vide the order dated 
16.01.2014. 
8. 
 
Aggrieved thereby, respondent preferred a writ petition 
before the High Court assailing the order of penalty dated 
07.03.2012 as affirmed by the appellate authority vide the order 

dated 26.10.2012 and by the reviewing authority vide the order 
dated 16.01.2014. The, a 
Single Bench of the High Court held that service of the respondent 
was extended till 01.10.2010 after his superannuation in the year 
2003. There was no further extension of service after 01.10.2010. 
Departmental 

proceeding 
was 
initiated 
on 
18.03.2011 when the chargesheet was issued by the disciplinary 
authority to the respondent which was admittedly after 
01.10.2010. Therefore, the appellant bank i.e. SBI had no 
jurisdiction to initiate departmental (disciplinary) proceeding 
beyond 01.10.2010. That being the position, the order of penalty 
dated 07.03.2012, the order of the appellate authority dated 
26.10.2012 and the order of the reviewing authority dated 
16.01.2014 were set aside and quashed. Appellants were directed 
to extend consequential service benefits to the respondent. 
9. 
 
The aforesaid judgment and order dated 06.09.2016 
passed by the Single Bench was assailed by the appellants before 
the Division Bench of the High Court in LPA No. 505 of 2016. 
9.1. 
Vide the judgment and order dated 11.02.2020, the 
Division Bench concurred with the view of the Single Bench and 

held that departmental (disciplinary) proceeding could not have 
been initiated and continued after superannuation of the 
respondent. Consequently, the Division Bench dismissed the 
letters patent appeal of the appellants as being devoid of any 
merit. 
10. 
Appellants had assailed the above findings before this 
Court by way of a special leave petition and on leave being 
granted, the present civil appeal came to be registered. 
11. 
Respondent has filed counter affidavit. While defending 
the judgments of the Single Bench and the Division Bench of the 
High Court, respondent has stated that he had joined service in 
the appellant bank on 08.06.1973. As per requirement of Rule 
19(1) of the Service Rules, appellant bank had extended the 
service of the respondent on completion of 30 years of service from 
27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. From 01.10.2010, no order, either oral 
or written, was issued by the appellant bank further extending 
the service of the respondent. Therefore, the master and servant 
relationship between SBI and the respondent came to be severed 
on 01.10.2010. 
11.1. 
During the extended period of service i.e. on 
18.08.2009, appellant bank had issued a notice to the respondent 

alleging irregularities by the respondent in the sanction and in 
the following up of advances and demand draft purchase for the 
periods from 19.01.2006 to 29.10.2008 and from 23.01.2009 to 
22.08.2009. 
11.2. 
Thereafter on 21.08.2009 respondent was placed 
under suspension. 
11.3. 
Respondent 
had 
exchanged 
several 
rounds 
of 
communication with the appellant bank to permit him to have 
access to documents relied upon by them while making the 
allegations against the respondent. In view of the documents 
being very voluminous, respondent had sought for time to submit 
his explanation which was declined by the appellant bank. 
11.4. 
Disciplinary authority vide the show cause notice 
dated 18.03.2011 informed the respondent that departmental 
(disciplinary) proceeding was being initiated against him on the 
articles of charges framed. Respondent has contended that 
initiation of disciplinary proceeding on 18.03.2011 was after 
expiry of the extended period of service of the respondent on 
01.10.2010. Be that as it may, disciplinary authority had 
appointed an enquiry officer who conducted enquiry into the 
charges and thereafter submitted his report on 17.12.2011. 

11.5. 
On the basis of the enquiry report, disciplinary 
authority imposed the penalty of dismissal from service on the 
respondent vide the order of penalty dated 18.03.2011. 
11.6. 
It is the contention of the respondent that the 
disciplinary proceeding was initiated against him after expiry of 
the extended period of service i.e. post superannuation. 
Therefore, such a disciplinary proceeding and the consequential 
order of penalty, appellate order and review order are non est in 
the eye of law being void-ab-initio. 
12. 
Mr. Balbir Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for 
the appellants, submitted that while the respondent was in 
service, he had committed serious irregularities. In this 
connection, show cause notice was issued on 18.08.2009. 
Thereafter, a detailed departmental enquiry was held in which the 
respondent had fully participated. Enquiry officer in his report 
dated 17.12.2011 held that out of the 20 charges, 16 were proved 
and 3 partly proved. He elaborated the charges which were proved 
against the respondent and summarised the same as under: 
a. sanctioned loans to his family members without 
obtaining prior approval. b. sanctioned loans on false certificates bearing 
false local addresses. c. unauthorisedly debited a customer’s account to 
meet the margin requirement in the loan 
sanctioned to his son. d. disbursed various loans without completing the 
formalities of documentation. e. took educational loans as a co-borrower along 
with his son and daughter, without approval. f. disbursed loans in various accounts without 
obtaining documents. g. allowed large value debits in 49 KCC accounts 
after the date of credit of waiver amounts under 
the scheme. h. 
9 cheques belonging to his wife and daughter 
were presented by him, which were later on 
dishonoured. i. took cash under acknowledgment on 9 occasions 
from customers of the bank but did not credit 
money to their account. 
12.1. 
He further submitted that respondent would have 
attained the age of 60 years on 30.10.2012. In fact, this has been 
the consistent stand of the respondent throughout the 
departmental proceeding. The penalty order was issued on 

07.03.2012 before the respondent had attained the age of 60 
years on 30.10.2012. 
12.2. 
Learned senior counsel also argued that it was not the 
case of the respondent either in appeal or in review or even before 
the learned Single Judge that the departmental proceeding 
against him was initiated after his superannuation and therefore 
was void-ab-initio. He had assailed the order of penalty on various 
other grounds including on merit. Therefore, the High Court was 
not justified in allowing the challenge of the respondent on the 
unpleaded ground that the departmental proceeding was initiated 
against him after his superannuation. This aspect was also 
overlooked by the Division Bench. 
12.3. 
Referring to the stand taken by the respondent in the 
departmental enquiry as well as before the appellate authority 
that he was due to superannuate on 30.10.2012, Mr. Singh 
submits that the same is binding on him. In fact, appellant bank 
had paid subsistence allowance to the respondent even after 
01.10.2010 right upto the date of dismissal from service which 
the respondent had accepted. Therefore, it is not open to the 
respondent to now contend that his service with the appellant 
bank had come to an end on 01.10.2010. 

12.4. 
Learned senior counsel also referred to Rule 19 of the 
Service Rules more particularly to sub-Rule (2) thereof and 
contends that there cannot be any automatic superannuation of 
an officer from the service of the appellant bank. Superannuation 
of an officer has to be sanctioned by the competent authority 
under Rule 19(2) of the Service Rules. 
12.5. 
Finally, Mr. Singh, learned senior counsel submits that 
the departmental proceeding against the respondent was initiated 
before he had retired from service. Therefore, in terms of the Rule 
19(3) of the Service Rules, respondent was deemed to have 
continued in service of the appellant bank for the purpose of such 
departmental proceeding. In this connection, he has placed 
reliance on the decision of this Court in SBI Vs. C.B. Dhall1. 
13., Mr. Vishwajit Singh, learned senior counsel 
for the respondent, submits that there is no error or infirmity in 
the impugned decision of the High Court. 
13.1. 
Learned senior counsel submits that the issue involved 
in the present case is quite simple: whether the appellant bank 
 
1 (1998) 

could have initiated disciplinary proceeding against the 
respondent after his superannuation. 
13.2. 
He submits that respondent had completed 30 years of 
service in the appellant bank in the year 2003. Therefore in terms 
of Rule 19(1) of the Service Rules, he was due to superannuate on 
26.12.2003. However, the appellant bank invoked the proviso to 
Rule 19(1) of the Service Rules and by recording reasons in 
writing extended the service of the respondent beyond 30 years 
from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. Thereafter, no further extension 
of service was granted by the appellant bank. As such, the 
respondent’s service in the appellant bank had ceased with effect 
from 01.10.2010. 
13.3. 
Though appellant bank had issued notice dated 
18.08.2009 to the respondent alleging irregularities and had 
suspended him from service on 21.08.2009, departmental 
proceeding was initiated against the respondent in terms of Rule 
68(1) of the Service Rules only on 18.03.2011 when the charge 
memo was issued, which was clearly after 01.10.2010. The 
factum of the respondent participating in the departmental 
proceeding or stating that he was due to superannuate on 
30.10.2012 would be of no consequence. Further, payment of 

subsistence allowance by the appellant bank and acceptance of 
the same by the respondent would also not lead to extension of 
service of the respondent post 01.10.2010. 
13.4. 
Learned senior counsel for the respondent therefore 
submits that the order of penalty imposed by the appellant bank 
on the respondent is clearly void-ab-initio and the High Court had 
rightly interfered with the same. In support of his submissions, 
he has placed reliance on the following decisions: 

UCO Bank Vs. Rajinder Lal Capoor2; and 

UCO Bank Vs. M.B. Motwani3, 
14. 
Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties 
have received the due consideration of the Court. 
15. 
Having heard learned counsel for the parties and upon 
perusal of the materials on record, we may briefly refer to the 
relevant provisions of the statutes governing the service condition 
of the respondent. 
15.1. 
In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-Section(1) 
of Section 43 of the State Bank of India Act, 1955, the Central 
Board of the State Bank of India has made the State Bank of India 
 
2 (2007) 
3 (2023) SCC Online SC 1327 

Officers (Determination of Terms and Conditions of Service) 
Order, 1979 (briefly ‘the Service Order’ hereinafter) to determine 
certain terms and conditions of appointment and service of 
officers in the State Bank of India (SBI). Order 19 thereof deals 
with the age of retirement. Clause (1) of Order 19 says that an 
officer shall retire from the service of SBI on attaining the age of 
58 years or upon the completion of 30 years’ service or 30 years’ 
pensionable service if he is a member of the Pension Fund, 
whichever occurs first. Thus, as per clause (1) of Order 19 of the 
Service Order, an officer of SBI shall retire from the service of the 
bank on the happening of three contingencies whichever occurs 
first. The three contingencies are: 
(i) on attaining the age of 58 years; or 
(ii) upon completion of 30 years of service; or 
(iii) completed 30 years of pensionable service, if he is a 
member of the Pension Fund. 
15.2. 
Therefore, what this provision contemplates is that an 
officer of SBI shall retire from service on completion of any one of 
the three contingencies whichever happens first. The first proviso 
confers a discretion upon the competent authority to extend the 
period of service of an officer who has either attained the age of 

58 years or has completed 30 years of service or has completed 
30 years of pensionable service, if it is deemed that such 
extension is desirable in the interest of SBI. However, the 
extended period of service shall not be counted for the purpose of 
pension. 
15.3. 
As per clause (2) of Order 19, no officer of SBI who has 
ceased to be in the service of SBI by virtue of any of the 
contingencies provided for in clause (1), shall be deemed to have 
retired from the service of the said bank for the purpose of the 
Pension and Guarantee Fund Rules or the Pension Fund Rules 
unless such cessation of service has been sanctioned on 
retirement for the purpose of either of the aforesaid two rules. 
15.4. 
Clause (3) of Order 19 makes it clear that in case 
disciplinary proceeding under the relevant rules of service has 
been initiated against an officer before he ceases to be in the 
service of SBI, the disciplinary proceeding may, at the discretion 
of the Managing Director, be continued after cessation of service 
and concluded by the authority which had initiated the same as 
if the officer continues in service. However, such an officer shall 
be deemed to be in service only for the purpose of continuance 
and conclusion of such proceeding. 

15.5. 
A conjoint reading of the three clauses of Order 19 
would indicate that an officer of SBI shall retire from the service 
of the said bank on fulfilment of either of the three conditions. 
However, the competent authority has the discretion to extend 
the period of service of such an officer, if such extension is 
deemed desirable in the interest of SBI though the extended 
period of service will not be counted for the purpose of pension. 
Under clause (2), no officer who has ceased to be in the service of 
SBI by virtue of the contingencies stipulated in clause (1), shall 
be deemed to have retired from service for the purpose of the 
Pension and Guarantee Fund Rules or the Pension Fund Rules 
unless such cessation of service has been sanctioned. Therefore, 
the sanctioning of cessation of service is only for the purpose of 
the aforesaid rules. Clause (3) contains the clarification that if 
disciplinary proceeding has been initiated against such an officer 
under the relevant service rules before he ceases to be in the 
service of SBI, the disciplinary proceeding may be continued and 
concluded by the authority which had initiated the same even 
post cessation of service of the officer. However, he shall be 
deemed to be in service only for the purpose of continuance and 
conclusion of such proceeding and not for any other purpose. 

16. 
Now let us turn to the State Bank of India Officers’ 
Service Rules, 1992 (already referred to as ‘the Service Rules’). 
Preamble to the Service Rules says that the said rules have been 
framed by the Central Board of the State Bank of India exercising 
powers conferred by sub-Section(1) of Section 43 of the State 
Bank of India Act, 1955 to determine the terms and conditions of 
appointment and service of all officers in the State Bank of India. 
The Service Rules came into effect from 01.01.1992. 
16.1. 
Rule 2(1) says that the Service Rules shall apply to all 
officers of SBI who are appointed or promoted to any of the grades 
mentioned in Rule 4 and also to whom any of the rules mentioned 
thereunder are applicable. The rules include the State Bank of 
India Officers’ (Determination of Terms and Conditions of Service) 
Order, 1979 (already referred to as ‘the Service Order’ 
hereinbefore). Rule 19 deals with retirement. As per Rule 19(1), 
an officer shall retire from the service of SBI on attaining the age 
of 60 years or upon the completion of 30 years of service or 30 
years of pensionable service, if he is a member of the Pension 
Fund, whichever occurs first. The first proviso says that the 
competent authority, may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, 
extend the period of service of an officer who has completed 30 

years of service or 30 years of pensionable service, as the case 
may be, should such extension be deemed desirable in the 
interest of the bank. However, the second proviso clarifies that an 
officer who has attained the age of 60 years shall not be granted 
any further extension in service. 
16.2. 
From a comparative analysis of Order 19(1) of the 
Service Order with Rule 19(1) of the Service Rules, what is 
discernible is that the only change introduced by the latter is in 
one of the conditions of superannuation i.e. the age. From 58 
years it has now become 60 years. Rest of the provision has 
remained 
unaltered, 
including 
the 
contingencies 
of 
superannuation. Whether it is 58 or 60 years, it is only one of the 
contingencies of superannuation, not the sole. Before attaining 
the age of 58 years or 60 years, as the case may be, an officer 
shall superannuate from service if he has completed 30 years of 
service or 30 years of pensionable service. However, the second 
proviso has made a clarification that an officer who has attained 
the age of 60 years shall not be granted any further extension in 
service. This means that an officer can be superannuated before 
attaining the age of 60 years if any one of the other two 
contingencies are fulfilled; he may also be granted extension of 

service thereafter but such extension of service cannot be beyond 
the age of 60 years. 
16.3. 
Rule 19(2), on the other hand, starts with a non-
obstante clause. It says that notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary in the Service Rules, no officer who has ceased to be in 
the bank’s service by the operation of, or by virtue of, any 
provision shall be deemed to have retired from the service of SBI 
for the purpose of the Imperial Bank of India Employees’ Pension 
and Guarantee Fund Rules or the State Bank of India Employees’ 
Pension Fund Rules unless such cessation of service has been 
sanctioned as retirement for the purpose of either of the said 
pension fund rules as may be applicable to him. Thus what Rule 
19(2) contemplates is sanctioning of cessation of service for the 
purpose of the aforesaid two rules only and for no other purpose. 
16.4. 
Sub-Rule (3) of Rule 19 provides that in case 
disciplinary proceeding under the relevant rules of service has 
been initiated against an officer before he ceases to be in the 
service of SBI by operation of, or by virtue of, any of the said rules 
or the provisions of the Service Rules, the disciplinary proceeding 
may at the discretion of the competent authority, be continued 
and concluded by the authority by which the proceeding was 

initiated in the manner provided in the said rules post cessation 
of service as if the officer continues to be in service; but he shall 
be deemed to be in service only for the purpose of continuance 
and conclusion of such proceeding. 
17. 
Chapter XI of the Service Rules deals with conduct, 
discipline and appeal. Chapter XI comprises of Rule 50 to Rule 
70. 
17.1. 
Section 2 of Chapter XI deals with discipline and 
appeal. Rule 67, which is part of Section 2, provides for various 
categories of minor and major penalties which may be imposed 
on an officer for an act of misconduct or for any other good and 
sufficient reason to be recorded in writing. 
17.2. 
The heading of Rule 68 which is also part of Chapter 
XI is decision to initiate and procedure for disciplinary action. Rule 
68(1) says that the disciplinary authority either by itself or on a 
direction of the superior authority may institute disciplinary 
proceeding against an officer. The disciplinary authority or any 
authority higher than it may impose any of the penalties 
mentioned in Rule 67 on such an officer. 
17.3. 
As per Rule 68(2), no order imposing any of the major 
penalties shall be made except after an inquiry held in accordance 

with Rule 68(2). Clause (iii) of sub-Rule (2) of Rule 68 says that 
where it is proposed to hold an inquiry, the disciplinary authority 
shall frame definite and distinct charges on the basis of the 
allegations against the officer and the articles of charge(s) 
together with the statement of allegations on which those are 
based, list of documents and witnesses relied on, copies of relied 
upon documents to the extent possible and the statement of 
witnesses shall be communicated in writing to the officer who 
shall be required to submit within such time as may be specified 
by the disciplinary authority, a written statement of his defence. 
17.4. 
Thereafter, the procedure for conducting inquiry is laid 
down. 
17.5. 
Rule 69 provides for appeal and review. As per sub-
Rule (1), an officer may appeal to the appellate authority against 
an order imposing upon him any of the penalties specified in 
Rule 67 or against an order of suspension. The procedural part of 
such an appeal is provided in sub-Rule (2). 
17.6. 
Rule 69(3) deals with review. Clause (i) thereof, which 
starts with a non-obstante clause, says that notwithstanding 
anything contained in Section 2, the reviewing authority may call 
for the record of the case within six months of the date of the final 

order and after reviewing the case, pass such order(s) thereon as 
it may deem fit. 
18. 
In Union of India Vs. K.V. Jankiraman4, this Court was 
examining the impact of sealed cover procedure on an employee 
due for promotion, increment etc. In that case, the employees 
were eligible for promotion but because of pending disciplinary 
proceeding, were subjected to sealed cover procedure. It was in 
that context that this Court considered amongst others the 
question as to what is the date from which it can be said that a 
disciplinary proceeding is pending against an employee. After due 
analysis, this Court held that it is only when a charge memo is 
issued to the employee that it can said a departmental 
(disciplinary) proceeding is initiated against the employee. 
19. 
This issue was again considered by this Court in 
Rajinder Lal Capoor (supra). Respondent in that case was an 
officer of the UCO Bank. Following a disciplinary proceeding, he 
was dismissed from service. However, the High Court in writ 
jurisdiction converted the punishment of removal from service 
into one of compulsory retirement with effect from the date of 
 
4 (1991) 

superannuation. UCO Bank came up in appeal following leave 
granted before this Court. On examining, this Court while opining 
that the High Court may not have been correct in converting the 
penalty of removal from service to compulsory retirement, 
however, came to the conclusion that initiation of departmental 
proceeding itself was wholly illegal and without jurisdiction. The 
chargesheet was issued on 13.11.1998 whereas the respondent 
had attained the age of superannuation on or before 01.11.1996. 
Referring to the relevant provision i.e. Regulation 20(3)(iii) of the 
UCO Bank Officer Employees’ Service Regulations, 1979 which 
created a legal fiction of continuance in service of the concerned 
officer post superannuation if disciplinary proceeding had been 
initiated prior to superannuation, such continuance of service 
being only for the purpose of conclusion of the disciplinary 
proceeding, this Court held that such a provision could be 
invoked only when the disciplinary proceeding had clearly been 
initiated prior to the respondents’ ceasing to be in service. Only 
when a valid departmental proceeding is initiated against the 
officer while in service, despite his attaining the age of 
superannuation, the disciplinary proceeding can be allowed to be 
continued on the basis of the legal fiction as if he was in service. 

Thus, when a departmental proceeding is continued by reason of 
the legal fiction, the delinquent officer would be deemed to be in 
service although he has reached his age of superannuation. 
Reiterating the view taken in K.V. Jankiraman(supra), this Court 
held that the departmental proceeding is not initiated merely by 
issuance of a show cause notice. It is initiated only when a 
chargesheet is issued. In the facts of that case, since the 
disciplinary 
proceeding 
was 
initiated 
after 
the 
age 
of 
superannuation, the chargesheet, inquiry report and the order of 
punishment were held to be illegal and without jurisdiction by 
this Court and those were set aside. Consequently, all retiral 
benefits due to the respondent was directed to be paid. 
20. 
Similarly in Coal India Ltd. Vs. Saroj Kumar Mishra5, 
this Court again reiterated the legal position that a departmental 
proceeding is ordinarily said to be initiated only when a 
chargesheet is issued. 
21. 
A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Canara Bank Vs. 
D.R.P. Sundharam6 examined the meaning and effect of 
Regulation 20(3)(iii) of the Canara Bank (Officers’) Service 
 
5 (2007) 
6 (2016) 

Regulations, 1979 which is pari materia to Regulation 20(3)(iii) of 
the UCO Bank Officer Employees’ Services Regulations, 1979 in 
the light of the view taken in Rajinder Lal Capoor (supra) and held 
that Regulation 20(3)(iii) is a stand-alone provision. By virtue of 
the said provision, a disciplinary proceeding initiated by means of 
a chargesheet prior to the retirement of a bank employee would 
continue even after his retirement in view of the provision 
contained in Regulation 20(3)(iii). In the facts of that case, the 
Bench noted that disciplinary proceeding was initiated by 
submission of chargesheet after the retirement of the respondent. 
Therefore, while confirming the decision of the High Court, this 
Court dismissed the appeal filed by Canara Bank. 
22. 
In the case of M.B. Motwani (supra), Supreme Court 
once again reiterated the position that a departmental proceeding 
is not initiated merely on issuance of a show cause notice. It is 
initiated only when a chargesheet is issued because that is the 
date of application of mind on the allegations levelled against an 
employee by the competent authority. In that case, it was noticed 
that 
the 
deceased 
employee 
had 
attained 
the 
age 
of 
superannuation on 31.07.1991 whereas the chargesheet was 
issued to him on 07.12.1991 meaning thereby that on the date of 

his superannuation, no disciplinary proceeding was pending 
against him. That being the position, this Court dismissed the 
appeal filed by UCO Bank. 
 
23. 
Having surveyed the relevant legal provisions and the 
case law, let us now revert back to the essential undisputed facts 
of the case. Respondent was appointed in the SBI as a clerk typist 
on 08.06.1973. In due course of time, he rose through the ranks 
and reached managerial position. On completion of 30 years of 
service, he was due to superannuate on 26.12.2003. Exercising 
powers under Rule 19(1) of the Service Rules, respondent was 
granted extension of service vide order dated 05.08.2023 from 
27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. On 18.08.2009, a notice was issued 
to the petitioner wherein and whereby serious irregularities 
allegedly committed by him were highlighted and his response 
was sought for. On 21.08.2009, respondent was placed under 
suspension. Though respondent had submitted his reply to the 
notice dated 18.08.2009 on 27.10.2009, it appears that the 
disciplinary authority did not accept such reply and decided to 
initiate disciplinary proceeding against the respondent by issuing 
show cause notice dated 18.03.2011 under Rule 68(1) of the 
Service Rules. Alongwith the show cause notice, articles of 

charges and the statement of allegations on the basis of which 
the charges were framed, were sent to the respondent. There is 
nothing on record to show further continuance of service by the 
respondent beyond 01.10.2010. As noted above, service of the 
respondent was extended from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. 
24. 
From the above, it is evident that charge memo was 
issued to the respondent on 18.03.2011 after his extension of 
service was over on 01.10.2010. This is an undisputed 
jurisdictional fact. 
25. 
Appellants have contended that respondent was paid 
subsistence allowance from his date of suspension i.e. 
21.08.2009 till his dismissal from service vide order dated 
07.03.2012 beyond 01.10.2010. Besides it was the case of the 
respondent himself before the enquiry officer, disciplinary 
authority as well as before the appellate authority that he was 
due to superannuate on 30.10.2012. He also did not plead either 
before the said authorities or before the High Court that he had 
ceased to be in service of SBI from 01.10.2010 and therefore the 
disciplinary proceeding initiated thereafter on 18.03.2011 was 
void-ab-initio. As such the learned Single Judge was not justified 

in accepting the challenge of the respondent to the order of 
penalty on a completely different ground. 
26. 
We are afraid we cannot accept such a contention on 
behalf of the appellants. Where the disciplinary proceeding itself 
is without jurisdiction, upholding the same on the specious plea 
that it was not challenged on the ground of lack of jurisdiction 
would be tantamount to giving imprimatur to a patently illegal 
proceeding. This aspect was gone into by the learned Single Judge 
in the following manner: 
6. After hearing learned counsel for the respective 
parties at length and on perusal of the records, I am 
of the considered view that the petitioner has been 
able to make out a case for interference due to the 
following facts and reasons stated hereinbelow: 
(I) Indisputably, on completion of 30 years of service 
in the year 2003, the services of the petitioner was 
extended till 01.10.2010 as per the State Bank of 
India officers (determination of term & conditions of 
services 1979). The alleged charges pertains to the 
extension period of the petitioner as Branch Manager, 
SBI, Tangerbansali Branch, Ranchi during the period 
19.01.2006 
to 29.10.2008 
and 23.01.2009 
to 
22.08.2009. After submission of explanation to the 
alleged charges, the disciplinary authority decided to 
initiate departmental proceeding vide letter dated 
18.03.2011 containing article of charges. In the 

disciplinary proceeding the order of dismissal has 
been passed under Rule 67(j) of the SBI Officers 
Service Rules which has been affirmed by the 
appellate as well as revisional authority. Admittedly, 
there has not been extension of service after 
01.10.2010 nor any provision of relevant rules has 
been brought to the notice of this Court as to what 
would be effect the disciplinary proceeding after 
retirement. When there is no express order by the 
respondent bank for extension of services after 
01.10.2010, the said date is to be treated as the date 
of retirement in usual course. In the instant case, the 
charge sheet was issued on 18.03.2011 after the date 
of deemed retirement of the petitioner when there was 
no specific order by the banking authorities for 
extension of services. Therefore, on that score, the 
impugned order of dismissal dated 07.03.2012 passed 
by the appointing authority being affirmed by the 
appellate authority as well as reviewing authorities 
being not legally sustainable is liable to be quashed. 
The view of this Court gets fortified by the decision of 
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India 
Vs. J. Ahmad reported in 1979 (2) SCC 286 which still 
holds the fields the entire departmental proceeding 
initiated against the petitioner after non-extension of 
service in terms of State Bank of India Officers 
(Determination of Terms and Conditions of Service) 
Order, 1979 as substituted on 23.02.1984 and State 
Bank of India Officers Service Rules, 1992 the 
relationship of master and servant has come to an end 

after 01.10.2010. Therefore, the respondent bank had 
no jurisdiction to initiate departmental proceeding 
without extension of services of the petitioner beyond 
01.10.2010. Apart from the aforesaid legal of 
provision in the instant case as apparent from the 
pleadings of the parties the bank has not suffered any 
pecuniary loss for any act of omission or commission 
on the part of petitioner. In the aforesaid backdrop 
of fact the initiation of departmental proceeding and 
imposition of extreme punishment of dismissal from 
services is unreasonable, illegal and not legally 
sustainable. 
 
27. 
When the appellants approached the Division Bench of 
the High Court in letters patents appeal, the Division Bench 
repelled the contention of the appellants and held as follows: 
11. 
The contention of the learned counsel for the 
appellant Bank that as per the Rule 19(1) of the State 
Bank of India Officers’ Service Rules, 1992, the 
respondent writ petitioner was to superannuate on 
completion of 60 years of age, is again, not in 
consonance with the Rules. The relevant portion of 
Rule 19(1) of the aforesaid Rules reads as follows:- 
“19.(1) An officer shall retire from the service 
of the Bank on attaining the age of sixty years 
or upon the completion of thirty years’ service 
or thirty years’ pensionable service, if he is a 
member of the Pension Fund, whichever 
occurs first.” 

A bare perusal of the Rule clearly shows that if 
an officer of the State Bank of India, completes thirty 
years of service prior to attaining the age of 60 years, 
he is to superannuate from service, on completion of 
thirty years of service, irrespective of the fact that he 
has not attained the age of 60 years. 
12. 
In the case of the writ petitioner, he was made 
to superannuate on the date of completion of 30 
years of service in the year 2003 itself, and he was 
again given an extension of service from 27.12.2003 
to 1.10.2010. As such, by no stretch of imagination, 
it can be said that even in case of extension of service 
given to the respondent writ petitioner beyond the 
period of 30 years of service, he was to continue in 
service till he attained the age of 60 years. No other 
Rule has been brought on record, or to the notice of 
this Court to show that even after completion of 30 
years of service, the officer of the Bank shall continue 
in service, till he attains the age of 60 years. Rule 
19(1) of the State Bank of India Officers’ Service 
Rules, 1992, is absolutely clear, without any 
ambiguity, wherein there is no scope of accepting the 
submission of learned counsel for the appellant 
Bank. 
13. 
Thus, the only conclusion that can be drawn 
in the present case, is that the writ petitioner could 
not have been allowed to continue in service after 
1.10.2010, in absence of any further extension of 
service, which admittedly was not done in the present 
case. In that view of the matter, we find that the 

departmental proceeding had been initiated and the 
punishment 
order 
was 
passed 
after 
the 
superannuation of the petitioner on 1.10.2010, as 
the initiation of the departmental proceeding was 
done on 18.03.2011, and the punishment order was 
passed by the Disciplinary Authority on 7.03.2012, 
i.e., after the date of superannuation, which was not 
permissible in the eyes of law, in absence of any 
disciplinary Rules. Admittedly, no such Rules were 
brought to the notice of the Writ Court, or to the 
notice of this Court. 
14. 
As such, we find no illegality in the impugned 
Judgment dated 6.9.2016, passed by the Writ Court 
in W.P.(S) No.3446 of 2014, holding that the 
departmental proceeding could not have been 
initiated and continued after the superannuation of 
the respondent writ petitioner, and allowing the writ 
application, quashing the order of dismissal from 
service passed by the Disciplinary Authority, as well 
as the orders of the Appellate and the Reviewing 
Authorities, worth any interference in exercise of the 
LPA jurisdiction. 
28. 
In so far the present case is concerned, respondent was 
due to superannuate on 26.12.2003 apparently on completion of 
30 years of service but his service was extended on 05.08.2003 
from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. Thus, the extended service of the 
respondent came to an end on 01.10.2010. The relationship of 

master and servant between the appellants and the respondent 
came to be severed on and from 01.10.2010. The factum of receipt 
of subsistence allowance thereafter or the respondent declaring 
that he would superannuate on a later date i.e. on 30.10.2012 on 
attaining the age of 60 years would not make any difference to the 
legal and factual scenario. Therefore, it is evident that respondent 
was no longer in the service of SBI post 01.10.2010. 
29. 
Attaining 60 years of service (earlier 58 years) is not 
the sole criterion of superannuation of an officer serving in SBI. 
As already noted and discussed above, it is one of the three 
contingencies. If any of the three contingencies are fulfilled, an 
officer would be superannuated. Respondent had actually 
superannuated from service in SBI on 26.12.2003 on completion 
of 30 years of service but his service was extended prior thereto 
on 05.08.2003 from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. Post 01.10.2010 
there was no further extension of service. 
30. 
Disciplinary proceeding against the respondent was 
not initiated on 18.08.2009 when the first notice to show cause 
was issued but was initiated only on 18.03.2011 when the 
disciplinary authority issued the charge memo to the respondent. 

31. 
As has been held by this Court on more than one 
occasion, a subsisting disciplinary proceeding i.e. one initiated 
before superannuation of the delinquent officer may be continued 
post superannuation by creating a legal fiction of continuance of 
service of the delinquent officer for the purpose of conclusion of 
the disciplinary proceeding (in this case as per Rule 19(3) of the 
Service Rules). But no disciplinary proceeding can be initiated 
after the delinquent employee or officer retires from service on 
attaining the age of superannuation or after the extended period 
of service. 
32. 
Even in the case of C.B. Dhall (supra) relied upon by 
the appellants, this Court while considering the purport of Rule 
20B of the State Bank of India (Supervising Staff) Service Rules, 
1975 held that under Rule 20B disciplinary proceeding, if 
initiated against an employee before he retires from service, could 
be continued and concluded even after his retirement and for the 
purpose of conclusion of the disciplinary proceeding, the 
employee is deemed to have continued in service but for no other 
purpose. 
33. 
That being the position, we see no merit in the appeal. 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. Appellants are directed to 

release all the service dues of the respondent expeditiously and 
at any rate not later than six weeks from today.
