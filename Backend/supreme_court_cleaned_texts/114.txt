These appeal(s) call into question the correctness of a common judgment 
and order dated 24th March 2022 passed by the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi, 
in W.P(s)(Crl.)Nos. 02 of 2021 and 47 of 2021, by which the High Court quashed 
Giridih(T)P.S.Case No.217 of 2020 o.04797769 dated 5th November, 

2 |Appeal No……./2024 (Crl)Nos.5531-32 of 2022 

2020, for the offences under Sections 420, 467, 468, and 471 of the Indian Penal 
Code, 18601, pending before the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Giridih. 
 
Brief Background 
3. 
One Purushotam Kumar (A-1) forged a Power of Attorney2 on the basis of 
which transfer of certain land in favour of Bikash Kumar Singh, S/o Surendra 
Singh (A-2), Surendra Singh (A-3) with the latter witnessing the sale transaction 
stood registered with the Registrar having competent jurisdiction at a place known 
as Giridih. The original owner Naveen Kumar Rai, having learnt of such an illegal 
transaction instituted proceedings before a Civil Court seeking a declaration of the 
transaction to be null and void. Independently, the District Deputy Registrar, 
Giridih initiated an inquiry in terms of Circular No.15/R(Miscellaneous)Public 
Applications-04/163 dated Nil resulting in the passing of an order, prima facie 
holding A-1 to have forged the PoA impersonating Naveen Kumar Rai, leading to 
the execution of a sale deed which document also stood registered with the very 
same Authority. Resultantly, on the basis of such an inquiry both the documents 
i.e., the PoA and the sale deed stood cancelled. Further, on the basis of the 
communication dated 15th October, 2020 that of the District Deputy Registrar, 
Giridih, FIR bearing the above-noted particulars stood registered by Sahdeo 
Mehra, against seven accused persons including A-1, A-2 and A-3. 
 
1 IPC for short 
2 PoA 
3 ‘Circular’

4. 
Assailing the said action of initiation of criminal proceedings, the accused 
persons preferred separate writ petitions titled Surendra Singh & Ors. v. State of 
Jharkhand and Ors; and Purushotam Rai urushotam Kumar Rai urushotom Kumar Rai v. State of Jharkhand and Ors., which stood disposed of 
vide the judgment impugned before us. 
5. 
A perusal of the impugned judgment shows the FIRs to have been quashed 
on the following counts:- 
(a) The original owner had already initiated civil proceedings; 
(b) No act of “criminality” can be said to be “made out”; 

 Initiation of criminal prosecution would amount to abuse of the 
process of Court (“perhaps meant as law”); 

The alleged action “appears” to be “a civil wrong” in relation to 
which, “with respect to the same cause of action” the title suit is 
pending. 

For ready reference the operative portion of the judgment is extracted 
as under:- 
 
“…However, in case, if it finds that the criminality is not made 
out and the criminal prosecution has been initiated, it will amount 
to an abuse of the process of Court. For the same cause of action 
and for cancellation of the sale deed as well as the power of 
attorney, the Title Suit has already been filed earlier by the 
intervener. It is well settled that any registered document can be 
annulled by way of filing the civil suit, which is not in the domain 
of the Deputy Commissioner to cancel the sale deed. Thus, it 
appears that for a civil wrong, the criminal case has been initiated 
against the petitioners and for the same cause of action, the title 
suit is pending. 

4 |Appeal No……./2024 (Crl)Nos.5531-32 of 2022 

 In view of the above facts and reasoned analysis, the 
Giridih(T) P.S. Case No.217 of 2020 for the alleged offence under 
Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code, pending 
in the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Giridih, is 
hereby, quashed…” 
 
6. 
In our considered view, the premise on which the Court proceeded in 
quashing the FIR is on the wrong assumption, interpretation, and application of the 
law. 
7. 
It is argued before us that the Circular stands quashed vide Judgment dated 
11th January, 2024 in W.P.(C)No.3103 of 2020 titled as Vinod Shankar Jha inod Shankar Jha v. State of Jharkhand and Ors. with connected writ petitions. 
8. 
Be that as it may. We are of the opinion that such a decision would have no 
bearing on the merits of the instant appeals. This we say so for the reason that the 
Circular primarily envisaged action for cancellation of the document by the 
authorities itself, whereas the power to set in motion the criminal machinery is 
totally independent and distinct from the cancellation of registration of the 
document. 
 
9. 
We may note that Section 82 and 83 of the Registration Act, 1908, 
empowers the Inspector General; the Registrar; or the Sub-Registrar, in whose 
territories, district, or sub-district, the offence stands committed to commence 
prosecution. For facility of reference, Sections 82 and 83 are reproduced herein 
below:- 

5 |Appeal No……./2024 (Crl)Nos.5531-32 of 2022 

“82. Penalty for making false statements, delivering false copies or 
translations, false personation, and abetment.-Whoever- 
(a) intentionally makes any false statement, whether on oath or not, 
and whether it has been recorded or not, before any officer acting 
in execution of this Act, in any proceeding or inquiry under this 
Act; or 
(b) intentionally delivers to a registering officer, in any proceeding 
under section 19 or section 21, a false copy or translation of a 
document, or a false copy of a map or plan; or 
(c) falsely personates another, and in such assumed character presents 
any document, or makes any admission or statement, or causes any 
summons or commission to be issued, or does any other act in any 
proceeding or enquiry under this Act; or 
(d) abets anything made punishable by this Act, shall be punishable 
with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, or 
with fine, or with both. 
 
83. Registering officers may commence prosecutions. 
(1) A prosecution for any offence under this Act coming to the 
knowledge of a registering officer in his official capacity may be 
commenced by or with the permission of the Inspector-General, the 
Registrar or the Sub-Registrar, in whose territories, district or sub-
district, as the case may be, the offence has been committed. 
(2) Offences punishable under this Act shall be triable by any Court or 
officer exercising powers not less than those of a Magistrate of the 
second class.” 
 
10. 
It is not in dispute that the communication dated 15th October, 2020 resulting 
in registration of the FIR was that of a competent authority i.e., the Sub-Registrar 
of the concerned district. In any event, such a power is the result of an action only 
in reference to and in connection with the Act and not the general provisions of 
IPC in relation to other penal provisions for which the FIR actually stood 
registered. 

6 |Appeal No……./2024 (Crl)Nos.5531-32 of 2022 

11. 
Given that the FIR against which the petition under Section 482 Code of 
Criminal Procedure4 had been preferred were offences contained only in the IPC, 
what the Court was required to consider was whether any of the well-established 
grounds that are enumerated in judgments of this Court viz., State of Haryana v. 
Bhajan Lal5; Neeharika Infrastructure v. State of Maharashtra6 and reiterated in 
Peethambaran v. State of Kerala7, were made out or not. We find the High Court 
to have referred to the detailed discussion in Vineet Kumar and Ors. v. State of 
Uttar Pradesh and Anr.8. but, however, discussion is conspicuously absent as to 
how the aspect of “criminality” is not present. It is all too well settled that while 
exercising such inherent powers what is required to be examined is only the prima 
facie existence of the offence sought to be quashed. For the offence of cheating, for 
instance, this Court has enumerated certain factors to be considered in Vijay 
Kumar Ghai v. State of West Bengal9. 
12. 
The Court’s observation that because there is no order of the Inspector 
General, “in spite of that this FIR has been lodged by the District Sub-Registrar, 
Giridih, which is against Section 83 of the Registration Act, 1908” as demonstrated 
(supra) is completely divorced from the text of the Section itself, for, it provides, as 
 
4 “Cr.P.C.” 
5 1992 Suppl.(1) SCC 335 
6 2021 SCC OnLine 315 
7 2023 SCC OnLine 553

9 (2022) 

7 |Appeal No……./2024 (Crl)Nos.5531-32 of 2022 

reproduced above, that a prosecution may be lodged by or with the permission of 
the Sub-Registrar in whose territory the offence has been committed. 
13. 
It is for both the above reasons that the exercise of power under Section 482 
Cr.P.C., in the attending facts and circumstances, was unjustified and entirely 
unsustainable. The FIR and the consequent case, quashed vide the impugned 
judgment stand restored to the file of the concerned district Court. All 
consequential steps may follow including the Trial Court commencing proceedings 
as per law. The appellant is directed to appear before the Court on 01.03.2024 at 
10.00 a.m. Once such presence is registered with the Court and the proceedings 
begin, we direct the trial to be expedited and, if not inconvenient and otherwise, 
possibly conduct the same on a day-to-day basis, minimizing adjournments so as to 
ensure that the proceedings are taken to the lawful conclusion at the earliest. 
14. 
With the above observations, the Criminal Appeals are allowed. Pending 
applications(s), if any, shall stand closed.
