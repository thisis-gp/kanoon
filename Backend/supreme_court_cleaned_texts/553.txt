JUDGMENT 
 
AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. 
 
1. The Appellant herein is the State of Gujarat 
which has challenged the judgment passed by, ETC. the High Court of Gujarat dated 28.04.2016 in 
an appeal preferred by it which was dismissed 
affirming the order dated 08.06.2015 of the 
Gujarat Value Added Tax Tribunal Ahmedabad 
(hereinafter referred to as ‘the Tribunal’), 
allowing the appeal of Respondent M/s Ambuja 
Cement, Ltd. 
2. The plea taken by the 
Appellant while 
challenging the judgments of the High Court 
and the Tribunal is that the Courts below have 
erred in holding that Value Added Tax and value 
of purchases on which no tax credit was claimed 
nor granted in the assessment, cannot be 
included in the aggregate of taxable turnover of 
purchases within the State for the purpose of 
reduction of tax credit under Section 11(3)(b) of 
the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003 
(hereinafter referred to as ‘the GVAT Act’)., ETC. 

3. Two substantial questions of law being framed 
by the High Court were as follows: - 
[1] Whether the Hon'ble 
Tribunal has erred in law 
and in facts in holding that 
value added tax paid on 
purchases is required to be 
excluded 
for 
computing 
"taxable 
turnover 
of 
purchases" under section 
11(3)(b) of the Act? 
 
[2] Whether the Hon'ble 
Tribunal has erred in law 
and in facts by holding that 
purchases on which value 
added 
tax 
is 
neither 
claimed nor granted are 
required to be excluded for 
computing 
"taxable 
turnover 
of 
purchases" 
under section 11(3)(b) of the 
Act? 
 
4. The learned senior advocate appearing for the 
Appellant has asserted that the Respondent 
dealer 
essentially 
calculated 
the 
taxable 
turnover of its purchases under the GVAT Act by 
excluding the Value Added Tax and value of, ETC. purchases 
on which 
no 
tax 
credit 
was 
claimed and reduced the taxable turnover of 
purchases by four per cent on the quantity of 
goods involved in the manufacture of goods 
dispatched by way of branch transfer as has 
been provided in Section 11(3)(b) of the GVAT 
Act. It is asserted that the Courts below have 
failed to appreciate that the assessing officer 
had rightly included the amount of Value Added 
Tax and unclaimed tax credit in the turnover of 
purchases as defined in Section 2(32) of the 
GVAT Act. 
5. It was further submitted that the legislative 
intent has been wrongly interpreted to say that 
it did not intend to include Value Added Tax 
within the definition of the purchase price as 
defined under Section 2(18) of the Gujarat Value 
Added Tax. Section 2(18) which defines the, ETC. purchase price is not exhaustive and the Value 
Added Tax should be included in the purchase 
price for the purpose of calculation of taxable 
turnover 
of 
purchases. 
Based 
on 
these 
submissions, it is asserted by the learned senior 
advocate for the Appellant that the judgments 
passed by the High Court as well as the Tribunal 
cannot be sustained and deserve to be set aside 
by 
restoring 
the 
orders 
passed 
by 
the 
assessment authorities being in accordance 
with the law. 
6. On the other hand, learned counsel for the 
Respondent has asserted that the judgment as 
passed by the Tribunal which has been 
approved by the High Court has laid down the 
correct 
interpretation 
of 
the 
statutory 
provisions. Supporting the said judgment, the 
learned counsel submitted that the purchase, ETC. price as defined aforesaid does not include the 
Value Added Tax component, and whatever 
duties and levies are required to be included in 
the meaning of purchase price are specifically 
provided for in the form of two Acts i.e., Central 
Excise Tariff Act, 1985 and the Customs Act, 
1962. Apart from these two taxes which have 
been specifically referred to and provided for in 
Section 2(18) of the GVAT Act, no other tax is to 
be included. Had the legislature intended to 
include the VAT component in the purchase 
price, the same could have been expressly 
provided for in the statute. 
7. It is further contended by the learned counsel 
that the scope of Section (11)(3)(b) of the GVAT 
Act while computing the taxable turnover of 
purchases cannot be expanded beyond the 
provision as provided for under the GVAT Act,, ETC. supporting the said judgment, therefore, it was 
prayed for the dismissal of the present appeals. 
8. We have considered the submissions made by 
the learned counsel for the parties and have 
gone through the provisions, as well as the 
pleadings. 
9. In brief, the facts of the case are that the 
Respondent dealer as mentioned calculated the 
taxable turnover of its purchases within the 
State of Gujarat by excluding the amount 
representing Value Added Tax and value of 
purchases of which no credit was claimed. This 
was asserted to have been done under the 
provisions of Section 11(3)(b) of the GVAT Act. 
Accordingly, the taxable turnover was calculated 
and proportionately reduced by four per cent on 
the 
quantity 
of 
goods 
involved 
in 
the, ETC. manufacturing of goods dispatched by way of 
branch transfer. 
10. The Deputy Commissioner during the process 
of audit assessment determined the taxable 
turnover of purchases within the State by 
including the tax amount i.e., Value Added Tax 
Amount and Value of Purchases on which no tax 
credit was claimed by the Respondent dealer nor 
proposed to be granted in the assessment. On 
the basis of this assessment, the Respondent 
being aggrieved preferred an appeal before the 
Joint Commissioner which was dismissed 
leading to the filing of a second appeal before the 
Gujarat 
Value 
Added 
Tax 
Tribunal 
at 
Ahmedabad wherein the same was partly 
allowed by holding that the tax and value 
purchases on which no tax was claimed nor was 
granted in the assessment could not be included, ETC. in the aggregate of taxable turnover of 
purchases within the State for the purpose of 
reduction of tax credit. The State of Gujarat 
carried an appeal before the High Court 
challenging the order passed by the Tribunal 
which has been dismissed affirming the order of 
the Tribunal. 
11. The issue involved in the present matters 
revolves around the definition of Purchase Price 
as provided for under sub-Section (18) of Section 
2 of the GVAT Act, which reads as follows: - 
 
2. In this Act, unless the context 
otherwise requires, - 

[ * 
* 
* 
* 
*] 
 
18. “purchase 
price” 
means 
the 
amount 
of 
valuable 
consideration 
paid or payable by a person 
for any purchase made 
including the amount of, ETC. duties levied or leviable 
under the Central Excise 
Tariff Act, 1983 or the 
Customs Act, 1962 and 
any 
sum 
charged 
for 
anything done by the seller 
in respect of the goods at 
the 
time 
of 
or 
before 
delivery thereof, other than 
the cost of insurance for 
transit or of installation, 
when 
such 
cost 
is 
separately 
charged 
and 
includes, - 
 
(a) in relation to – 

the 
transfer, 
otherwise than in 
pursuance of a 
contract 
of 
property in any 
goods, 

the 
supply 
of 
goods 
by 
any 
unincorporated 
association 
or 
body of persons 
to 
a 
member 
thereof, 
(iii) the 
supply 
by 
way of or as part 
of any service or 
in 
any 
other 
manner 
whatsoever, 
of, ETC. goods, being food 
or 
any 
other 
article for human 
consumption or 
any 
drink 
(whether or not 
intoxicating), the 
amount of cash, 
deferred 
payment or other 
valuable 
consideration 
paid or payable 
therefor, 

in 
relation 
to 
the 
transfer of property in 
goods (whether as goods 
or in some other form) 
involved 
in 
the 
execution of a works 
contract, such amount 
as is arrived at by 
deducting 
from 
the 
amount 
of 
valuable 
consideration paid or 
payable by a person for 
the execution of such 
works 
contract, 
the 
amount 
representing 
labour charges for such 
execution, 
 (c) in relation to the delivery 
of 
goods 
on 
hire 
purchase or any system 
of 
payment 
by, ETC. installments, 
the 
amount 
of 
valuable 
consideration 
payable 
by a person for such 
delivery. 

12. On going through the above definition as has 
been provided for, it would indicate that the 
same is not only exclusive but exhaustive as 
well, it can rather be said to be enumerative. 
The first and foremost duty of the Court is to 
read the statute as it is and if the words therein 
are clear and unambiguous then only one 
meaning can be inferred. The Courts are 
bound to give effect to the said meaning 
irrespective of the consequences so far as the 
taxation statutes are concerned. Article 265 of 
the Constitution of India, 1950 prohibits the 
State from extracting tax from the citizens 
without the authority of law. The tax statutes, ETC. have to be interpreted strictly which means 
that the legislature mandates taxing certain 
persons in certain circumstances which cannot 
be expanded or interpreted to include those 
who were not intended or comprehended. The 
assessee is not to be taxed without clear words 
and, for that purpose, the same must be 
according to the natural construction of the 
words which have been used in that statute. 
These words have to be read as it is and thus 
cannot be added or substituted which may give 
a meaning other than what is expressed in the 
provision. 
13. In the case of Commissioner of Wealth Tax, 
Gujarat-III, Ahmedabad v. Ellis Bridge 
Gymkhana1 this Court held as follows: - 
“5. The rule of construction 
of a charging section is that 
 
1 1998 (1) SCC 384., ETC. before taxing any person, it 
must be shown that he 
falls within the ambit of the 
charging section by clear 
words used in the section. 
No one can be taxed by 
implication. 
A 
charging 
section has to be construed 
strictly. If a person has not 
been brought within the 
ambit 
of 
the 
charging 
section by clear words, he 
cannot be taxed at all. 
6. *** what has been 
specifically left out by the 
legislature 
cannot 
be 
brought back within the 
ambit 
of 
the 
charging 
section by implication or by 
ascribing 
an 
extended 
meaning 
to 
the 
word 
“individual” 
so 
as 
to 
include whatever has been 
left out.” 
 
14. In the case of P. Kasilingam and Others v. 
P.S.G. College of Technology and Others2 
this Court while interpreting the use of 
expressions in the statute observed as follows: 
 
2 1995 Supp (2) SCC 348., ETC. 

“19…. The use of the word 
‘means’ 
indicates 
that 
“definition is a hard-and-
fast 
definition, 
and 
no 
other 
meaning 
can 
be 
assigned to the expression 
than 
is 
put 
down 
in 
definition”. 
(See: Gough v. Gough [(1891) 2 
QB 665: 60 LJ QB 726]; Punjab Land Development 
and 
Reclamation 
Corpn. 
Ltd. v. Presiding 
Officer, 
Labour Court [(1990), 717: 1991 SCC (L&S) 
71].) The word ‘includes’ 
when used, enlarges the 
meaning of the expression 
defined 
so 
as 
to 
comprehend not only such 
things 
as 
they 
signify 
according to their natural 
import 
but 
also 
those 
things which the clause 
declares that they shall 
include. The words “means 
and includes”, on the other 
hand, 
indicate 
“an 
exhaustive explanation of 
the meaning which, for the 
purposes of the Act, must 
invariably be attached to 
these 
words 
or 
expressions”. 
(See: Dilworth v. Commissioner, ETC. of Stamps [1899 AC 99, 
105-106: (1895-9) All ER 
Rep 
Ext 
1576] 
(Lord 
Watson); Mahalakshmi Oil 
Mills v. State of A.P. [(1989), 169: 1989 SCC 
(Tax) 56] The use of the 
words 
“means 
and 
includes” 
in 
Rule 
2(b) 
would, therefore, suggest 
that 
the 
definition 
of 
‘college’ is intended to be 
exhaustive 
and 
not 
extensive and would cover 
only 
the 
educational 
institutions falling in the 
categories specified in Rule 
2(b) and other educational 
institutions 
are 
not 
comprehended. Insofar as 
engineering colleges are 
concerned, their exclusion 
may be for the reason that 
the opening and running of 
the 
private 
engineering 
colleges 
are 
controlled 
through 
the 
Board 
of 
Technical Education and 
Training and the Director 
of Technical Education in 
accordance 
with 
the 
directions issued by the 
AICTE from time to time.”, ETC. 

15. In the light of the above reproduced definition 
as provided for under Section 2(18) of the GVAT 
Act, it becomes obvious that the definition is 
enumerative and exhaustive. The use of the 
word “means” denote the intention of the 
legislature to restrict the scope of the 
“purchase price” to the categories enumerated 
in the definition itself. The purchase price, 
therefore, would be the amount of valuable 
consideration paid or payable for any purchase 
which would include amount of duties, levied 
or leviable under the two acts as has been 
provided for in this Section apart from the 
other charges as expounded therein. The 
scope has been limited to the two Acts 
mentioned in the Section itself. The same could 
not be expanded and therefore it can be safely 
said that the intention of the legislature was to, ETC. exclude Value Added Tax from the ambit of 
purchase price as the same is not found 
mentioned in the categories of tax/duties 
enumerated thereunder. Sub-Section (32) of 
Section 2 of the GVAT Act defines turnover of 
purchases which reads as follows: - 
“2. In this Act, unless the context 
otherwise requires, - 
 
[* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
*] 
 
32. “turnover 
of 
purchases” 
means 
the 
aggregate of the amounts 
of purchase price paid or 
payable by a dealer in 
respect of any purchase of 
goods made by him during 
a 
given 
period 
after 
deducting the amount of 
purchase price, if any, 
refunded to the dealer by 
the seller in respect of any 
goods purchased from the 
seller and returned to him 
within 
the 
prescribed 
period.”, ETC. 

16. The above provision makes it amply clear that 
the purchase price would be the determinative 
factor for calculating the turnover of purchases, 
as stated above, the purchase price would be 
restrictive within the domain of Section 2(18). 
Section 11 of the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act 
deals with the tax credit. The relevant portion 
thereof reads as follows: 
 
11.(1)(a) A registered dealer 
who has purchased the 
taxable goods (hereinafter 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
“purchasing dealer”) shall 
be entitled to claim tax 
credit equal to the amount 
of,- 
(i) tax collected from the 
purchasing dealer by a 
registered 
dealer 
from 
whom he has purchased 
such goods or the tax 
payable by the purchasing 
dealer 
to 
a 
registered 
dealer who has sold such 
goods to him during the tax 
period, or]; 
[ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ], ETC. 

(b)The tax credit to be so 
claimed under this sub-
section shall be subject to 
the 
provisions 
of 
sub-
sections (2) to (12); and the 
tax 
credit 
shall 
be 
calculated in such manner 
as may be prescribed. 
 
[ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ] 
 
11.(3)(b) 
Notwithstanding 
anything contained in this 
section, the amount of tax 
credit in respect of a dealer 
shall be reduced by the 
amount of tax calculated at 
the rate of four per cent. on 
the turnover of purchases- 

of 
taxable 
goods 
consigned or dispatched 
for branch transfer or to 
his agent outside the State, 
or 
(ii) of goods taxable which 
are used as raw materials 
in the manufacture, or in 
the packing of goods which 
are dispatched outside the 
State in the course of 
branch 
transfer 
or 
consignment 
or 
to 
his 
agent outside the State,, ETC. 

(iii) of fuel used for the 
manufacture of goods.:] 
 
[Provided that where the 
rate of tax of the taxable 
goods 
consigned 
or 
dispatched by a dealer for 
branch transfer or to his 
agent outside the State is 
less than four per cent., 
then the amount of tax 
credit in respect of such 
dealer shall be reduced by 
the 
amount 
of 
tax 
calculated at the rate of tax 
set out in the Schedule on 
such 
goods 
on 
the 
34[taxable 
turnover 
of 
purchases 
with 
in 
the 
State.] 
 
17. The cogent reading of sub-Section (18) of 
Section 2 which defines ‘purchase price’, sub-
Section 32 of Section 2 which defines ‘turnover 
of purchases’, and Section 11 of the GVAT Act 
which deals with entitlement to the tax credit, 
would lead to only one conclusion, that the 
purchase price would not include purchases on, ETC. which no value added tax was claimed nor 
granted and the component of value added tax 
stood already paid on purchases. Accordingly, 
the taxable turnover of purchases would have 
to be calculated after deducting both the 
components as has been detailed aforesaid. 
18. Therefore, the calculation of taxable turnover 
of the purchases and reduction value of 
purchases on which no tax credit was claimed 
nor granted, and component of value added tax 
already paid on purchases, was rightly 
excluded from the total turnover of the 
Respondent dealer while computing his tax 
liability under Section 11(3)(b) of the GVAT Act. 
19. The order passed by the Tribunal as has been 
upheld vide the impugned judgment of the 
High Court being in accordance with law calls, ETC. for no interference and therefore, the appeals 
deserve dismissal. 
20. 
The appeals, accordingly, stand dismissed. 
 
21. As regards the Transfer Cases which were 
directed to be heard along with the present 
Appeals, are allowed in the light of the above 
Judgment passed in the Appeals....………………………………. J.
