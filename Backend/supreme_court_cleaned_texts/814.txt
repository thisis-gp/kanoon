VERSUS 

THE STATE OF TELANGANA 
& ORS. 

 …RESPONDENTS 

JUDGMENT 

ABHAY S. OKA, J. 
 
FACTUAL ASPECT 
1. 
The appellant is the complainant on whose complaint 
a First Information Report being Crime No.21 of 2021 (for 
short, ‘the impugned FIR’) was registered for the offences 
punishable under Sections 342, 347, 504, 506, 116 and 
384 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (for 
short, ‘the IPC’) as well as under Sections 23 and 24 of the 
Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens 
Act, 2007 (for short, ‘the 2007 Act’). 2nd to 5th respondents 
were shown as accused. The 2nd respondent is a son of the 

appellant. The 3rd respondent is the wife of the 2nd 
respondent. The 4th respondent is the daughter of 2nd and 
3rd respondents. The 5th respondent is the father of the 3rd 
respondent. 
2. 
One Dhanyakumar Doshi was the appellant’s 
husband. The appellant has two sons (2nd respondent and 
Akshay) and two daughters - Shubhangi and Sangita. The 
appellant’s husband died on 24th February 2020. On 4th 
September 2017, the appellant and her husband executed 
a registered Gift Deed by which they gifted an immovable 
property and a residential house to 4th respondent. On 16th 
October 2017, the appellant and her husband executed a 
Deed of Rectification to correct the mistake that crept into 
the description of the property in the Gift Deed dated 4th 
September 2017. Another Gift Deed was executed by the 
appellant and her husband on 7th November 2017, by 
which they gifted a flat/apartment in Hyderabad to the 2nd 
and 4th respondents. 
3. 
It is the case of the appellant that on 29th March 
2019, her husband addressed a letter to the District 
Magistrate and District Commissioner of Hyderabad 
Urban District alleging that the 2nd and 3rd respondents 
have been harassing and threatening him and the 
appellant and that they forced them to execute gift deeds 
of their valuable properties. He alleged that the 2nd and 3rd 

respondents had threatened him not to disclose the 
execution of gift deeds. He was afraid of revealing the said 
facts to anyone. He alleged that 2nd and 3rd respondents 
were ill-treating his younger son. Therefore, the appellant’s 
husband requested the District Magistrate to cancel the 
Gift 
Deeds. 
In 
the 
letter, 
the 
appellant’s 
husband mentioned that his confidant shall post the same 
only after his death. The appellant's case is that when her 
daughter Sangita visited Hyderabad, her husband handed 
her a copy of the letter dated 29th March 2019. 
4. 
On 7th November 2020 and on 12th November 2020, 
the appellant’s daughter - Sangita, addressed letters to 
Adarshnagar Colony Police Station at Hyderabad and 
Saidabad Police Station at Hyderabad, respectively, 
complaining about the fact that the 2nd and 3rd 
respondents were ill-treating the appellant and that they 
had confined her to the house. The appellant signed a 
document dated 24th November 2020 (Annexure P-7) 
wherein she declared that her life was in danger as she 
was apprehending some actions by the 2nd and 3rd 
respondents. Another complaint was filed by the appellant 
on 7th December 2020 to the Commissioner of Police 
Saidabad, Telangana, making similar allegations. On 17th 
January 2021, the impugned FIR was registered based on 
the complaint made by the appellant on 17th January 
2021. Before the High Court of Telangana, the 2nd to 5th 

respondents filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, ‘the CrPC’) for 
quashing the impugned FIR. The learned Single Judge of 
the High Court, by the impugned order dated 1st June 
2021, allowed the quashing petition in part and quashed 
the proceedings insofar as the 4th and 5th respondents are 
concerned. This is the impugned judgment which has been 
challenged by way of present appeal. 
SUBMISSIONS 
5. 
The learned counsel appearing for the appellant has 
taken us through different complaints made by the 
appellant and the letter dated 29th March 2019 addressed 
by the appellant’s husband. He submitted that when 
the investigation of the impugned FIR was at a nascent 
stage, the High Court ought not to have interfered at this 
stage. He submits that the impugned FIR cannot be 
treated as a compendium of the prosecution case. The 
power of quashing should not have been exercised without 
allowing the police to investigate the offence. He pointed 
out that the appellant and her husband were made to stay 
in the atmosphere of terror, as is evident from the letter 
dated 29th March 2019 addressed by the appellant’s 
husband to the District Magistrate. On the envelope of the 
said letter, the appellant’s husband specifically stated that 
a copy of the letter shall be forwarded only after his death. 

Relying upon a decision of this Court in the case of M/s 
Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. v. State of 
Maharashtra and Ors.1, the learned counsel submitted 
that criminal proceedings cannot be scuttled at the initial 
stage and quashing FIR at this stage should be only by way 
of exception. Learned counsel also submitted that the 
finding of the High Court that there are no specific 
allegations against the 4th and 5th respondents is 
completely erroneous. He invited our attention to the 
correspondence made by the appellant’s daughter and the 
appellant with the police, wherein specific allegations were 
made against the 4th and 5th respondents. 
6. 
The learned senior counsel appearing for the 
respondent nos. 2 to 4 submitted that the prosecution at 
the instance of the appellant was a complete abuse of the 
process of law, and the view taken by the High Court does 
not call for any interference. 
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS 
7. 
At the outset, we must clarify that we are examining 
the challenge to the impugned judgment only to the limited 
extent of the order of quashing the impugned FIR as far as 
the 4th and 5th respondents are concerned. We are not 
 
1 (2021) 

examining the case made out by the appellant as against 
the 2nd and 3rd respondents. 
8. 
The appellant and her husband executed the Gift 
Deeds on 4th September 2017 and 7th November 2017. In 
between, there was a Deed of Rectification dated 16th 
October 2017 in respect of the Gift Deed dated 4th 
September 2017. 
9. 
We have perused the letter dated 29th March 2019, 
allegedly written by the appellant’s husband. We may note 
here that the letter was addressed by him more than 16 
months after the execution of the second Gift Deed. No 
allegations were made against the 4th and 5th respondents 
in this letter. We have carefully perused the complaints 
dated 7th November 2020 and 12th November 2020 
addressed by the appellant’s daughter - Sangita, to officers 
in charge of two different Police Stations. The letter dated 
7th November 2020 records that the 4th respondent had left 
for the UK and was staying there. We find no specific 
allegations against the 4th and 5th respondents in the 
complaint. It is pertinent to note that as stated in the letter 
dated 7th November 2020 sent by the appellant’s daughter 
Sangita, in January 2020, the appellant’s husband gave 
her a copy of the letter dated 29th March 2019. In both 
letters, there are only vague and general allegations 
against the 4th and 5th respondents. In the writing dated 

24th November 2020, allegedly signed by the appellant, she 
had complained about the burn injuries sustained by her. 
Even in the letter, no specific allegations were made 
against the 4th and 5th respondents. In the complaint dated 
7th December 2020 addressed by the appellant to the 
Commissioner of Police, Cyberabad, Telangana, only 
general allegations have been made that the 4th and 5th 
respondents were acting hand in hand at the instance of 
the 2nd and 3rd respondents. This is the only allegation 
made against the 4th and 5th respondents. In the complaint 
dated 11th January 2021 made by the appellant, there is a 
bald allegation that the 2nd to 5th respondents compelled 
herself and her husband to execute the gift deeds. It is also 
stated that the 2nd and 3rd respondents were ill-treating her 
other son, Akshay. 
10. There is a delay involved in the registration of FIR. 
The letter dated 29th March 2019, which was relied upon 
by the appellant and addressed by her husband, shows 
that on 29th March 2019, her deceased husband was 
aware of the two gift deeds executed by him and the 
appellant. The appellant’s husband complained about the 
gift deeds after a gap of 16 months from the date of the 
execution of the second gift deed. The appellant’s first 
complaint was on 24th November 2020. Apart from this 
delay, after having perused not only the letters/complaints 
of the appellant but also the letters addressed by her 

husband and daughter, we find that the appellant has not 
made any allegation against the 4th and 5th respondents 
ascribing them any specific role. 
11. The role allegedly played by the 4th and 5th 
respondent is within the special knowledge of the 
appellant. She cannot improve upon what she said in her 
earlier complaints/letters even if the investigation 
proceeds against them. 
12. Therefore, the view taken by the High Court that the 
FIR deserves to be quashed as against the 4th and 5th 
respondents cannot be faulted. Therefore, no case is made 
out to interfere in this criminal appeal. Accordingly, the 
Criminal Appeal is dismissed.
