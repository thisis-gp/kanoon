JUDGMENT 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 
1. 
This is a batch of 117 petitions, including four 
contempt petitions which are de-tagged for being 
listed separately, filed primarily by the transporters 
and tour operators under Article 32 of the 
Constitution of India assailing the legality of different 
State 
Governments 
levying 
and 
collecting 
Authorization Fee/Border Tax in violation of All India 

 ETC.ETC. 

Tourist Vehicles (Permit) Rules, 20231. Broadly, there 
are three categories of petitions but the relief claimed 
which is common in all the petitions, is about the levy 
and collection of Border Tax/ Authorization Fee. 
2. 
In some cases, there is a challenge to the All-India 
Tourists Vehicles (Authorisation of Permit) Rules, 
20212 as also certain provisions of Motor Vehicles 
Act, 1988, however, such petitions were filed prior to 
the coming of the Rules, 2023. As such, the reliefs 
have 
been 
amended 
seeking 
directions 
for 
compliance of provisions contained in the Rules, 
2023. In some cases, petitioners have also prayed for 
refund of the Border Tax/ Authorization Fee already 
realized by the State Authorities at the time of their 
vehicles entering the State. 
3. 
Initially, it was the State of Tamil Nadu which was 
said to be realizing the Border Tax/ Authorization Fee 
but, later on, several other States were also 
complained 
of 
realizing 
similar 
Border 
Tax/ 
Authorization Fee despite the transporters or the 
vehicles entering the State having already paid the 
requisite tax/fee under the Rules, 2023. As such, 
 
1 The Rules, 2023 
2 The Rules, 2021 

 ETC.ETC. other States also became the respondent-parties and 
notices were issued to them. 
4. 
The Rules, 2023 superseded the All-India Tourists 
Vehicles (Authorization/Permit) Rules, 2021. After 
the coming into of the Rules, 2023, the power of 
levying/collecting Border Tax/Authorization Fee by 
the State Governments at various border check posts 
from vehicles carrying All India Tourists Permit was 
to be done away with. There were primarily two 
objects of bringing in the Rules, 2023. Firstly, to 
make the movement of such tourist vehicles across 
the country through different States seamless and 
smooth; and secondly, the revenue to be generated 
by the Centre to be proportionately shared with the 
State Governments, also taking into account their 
previous revenue generation, and also, keeping in 
mind that their earlier revenue income was not 
reduced in any manner. 
5. 
The transporters started facing difficulties and 
harassment as alleged at the borders of different 
States where they were again being demanded Border 
Tax/Authorization Fee which has given rise to the 
filing of this group of petitions. Such demand of 
Border Tax/Authorization Fee was challenged on 
several grounds ranging from double taxation; levy 

 ETC.ETC. being without legal authority; being in violation of the 
Rules, 2023 which had been framed under Entry 35 
of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution 
of India, and various other grounds. 
6. 
In all these matters while issuing notices, interim 
relief was also granted that the State Governments 
were restrained from making any further realization 
of Border Tax/Authorization Fee. 
7. 
Upon notice, States appeared and filed their counter 
affidavits. The submission advanced by the States is 
that the demand being raised by them is primarily 
under the rules framed by the respective State 
Governments under Entries 56 & 57 of List II of 
Schedule VII of the Constitution. They have defended 
their competence to frame the rules, to levy and 
collect the taxes, which according to them, are in 
accordance to law. 
8. 
It is also their submission that the petitioners, in 
case, had any grievance ought to have approached 
the respective High Courts under Article 226 of the 
Constitution rather than approaching this Court 
under Article 32 of the Constitution. Lastly, and most 
importantly, it was contended that State Acts/Rules 
levying such tax has not been put to challenge and 
therefore, the petitions deserve to be dismissed. 

 ETC.ETC. 

9. 
Although counsel for the parties have raised their 
arguments on merits, but we are not inclined to go 
into the merits of the matter at this stage, as 
apparently, the fundamental question to be decided 
would be whether levy and realization of taxes by the 
respective states is covered by the Act and Rules 
framed by the respective States under Entries 56 & 
57 of List II of Schedule VII of the Constitution or not. 
10. The State enactments, rules and regulations being 
not under challenge, it cannot be said that the 
demand of Border Tax/Authorization Fee at the 
borders by the respective State Governments is bad 
under law. The petitioners, in order to succeed, have 
to consider challenging the State provision contained 
in the Act. There is another reason why we are not 
entertaining the matters on merit is that the 
petitioners ought to have first approached their 
jurisdictional 
High 
Courts 
to 
challenge 
their 
respective State enactments. 
11. We, accordingly, dispose of these petitions without 
interfering with the demands being raised by the 
State Governments while giving liberty to the 
petitioners to approach the jurisdictional High 
Courts for their reliefs. It is made clear that we have 

 ETC.ETC. neither entered into the merits of the matter nor 
examined the same. 
12. Insofar as the tax already recovered, the same would 
be subject to final outcome of the petitions that may 
be filed before the High Courts. Insofar as the period 
of interim order passed by this Court is concerned, 
the petitioners would give undertakings before the 
High Courts that, in case they fail, they will make 
good on demands which would have been raised for 
the period for which the stay has been enjoyed.
