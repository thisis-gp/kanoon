M/S MADURA COATS 
PRIVATE LIMITED 

VERSUS 
THE COMMISSIONER OF 
CENTRAL EXCISE AND ANR. 

 J U D G E M E N T 

Aravind Kumar, J. 
 
1. 
Leave granted. 
 
2. 
Being aggrieved by the order dated 18.07.2018 passed by the High 
Court, Madras whereunder the order of the Customs, Excise and Service Tax 
Appellate Tribunal (hereafter referred to as ‘CESTAT’) dated 05.05.2009 
came to be set aside and remanded the matter back to the tribunal for disposal 
of the appeals came to be passed by directing the appeals be heard on merits 
these appeals have been filed. 
 
3. 
Short facts shorn of explicit details are as under: 

4. 
 The appellant is engaged in the manufacture of cotton yarn, 
polyester yarn etc. and based on an information received that it had indulged 
in clearance of certain goods manufactured by it without payment of duty 
resulted in the preventive unit of the respondent visiting the unit and 
conducting stock challenge of the finished fabrics stocked in the bonded 
warehouse. Based on a prima facie and reasonable belief that excess 
quantities of stock were stored for illicit removal, the department seized the 
excess stock under mahazar and it was provisionally released on execution 
of general bond; it also resulted in the issuance of two show cause notices 
(for short SCN’s) dated 11.05.2001 and 02.11.2001 which resulted in two 
orders being passed on 28.02.2006 by the respondent herein. Being 
aggrieved by the same appeals came to be filed before CESTAT whereunder 
the tribunal vide order dated 06.09.2006 set aside the orders in original dated 
28.02.2006, with a direction to the respondent to provide a copy of the letter 
dated 20.01.2001 referred to in the SCN’s to the appellant and to decide the 
matter afresh. 
 
5. 
In the teeth of direction issued by the tribunal, first respondent 
adjudicated the show cause notices afresh and by separate orders dated 
21.11.2008 and 27.11.2008 raised the demand for payment of duty as 
indicated in the respective orders which resulted in both the orders being 
challenged by filing two appeals before CESTAT and vide order dated 

05.05.2009 in order No. 550 and 551 of 2009 tribunal allowed the appeals 
and set aside the aforesaid orders of the respondent and yet again directed 
the respondent herein to pass fresh orders after providing the copy of the 
letter dated 20.01.2001. 
 
6. 
Thereafter, the respondent herein filed an application under section 
35C (2) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (hereinafter referred to as ‘CE Act’ 
for short) for rectification of the order dated 05.05.2009 contending inter alia 
that letter dated 20.01.2001 which was ordered to be furnished by the 
department was not available and sought permission to adjudicate the SCN’s 
afresh without supplying or taking into account the said communication 
dated 20.01.2001. The said application came to be dismissed as withdrawn 
with liberty to take appropriate steps vide order dated: 04.01.2010. In the 
light of the said liberty granted, the respondent herein filed two 
miscellaneous petitions before CESTAT for modification of the order No.550 
and 551 of 2009 dated 05.05.2009 resulting in modification of the order 
dated 05.05.2009 whereby the respondent was directed to adjudicate the 
show cause notices without relying upon the letter dated 20.01.2001. Being 
aggrieved by the same, the appellant herein filed two appeals before the High 
Court in CMA No.469 and 470 of 2010 resulting in the order of the tribunal 
being set aside and remanding the matter back for hearing the appeal afresh. 
Hence, these appeals. 

7. 
We have heard the arguments of Shri Shekhar Naphade, learned 
Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant and Shri V.C. Bharathi, learned 
Counsel appearing on behalf of Mr. N. Venkatraman, Additional Solicitor 
General, for respondent. It is the thrust of the arguments of Shri Shekhar 
Naphade, learned Senior Counsel that final order No.838 to 840 of 2006 
dated 06.09.2006 passed by the tribunal having attained finality whereunder 
the respondent was directed to furnish the copy of the letter dated 20.01.2001 
and the annexures appended thereto and due to non-compliance thereof the 
High Court ought to have allowed the appeal in its entirety and it could not 
have remanded the matter back to the tribunal for adjudication of SCN’s 
afresh. He would elaborate his submissions by contending that order dated 
06.09.2006 passed by the tribunal by remanding the matter to the 
adjudicating authority with specific direction being final and binding on the 
department, said order could not have been modified by the tribunal that too 
based on an application for modification vide order dated 08.03.2010. He 
would also contend that High Court erred in not appreciating the fact that in 
the absence of document containing detailed explanation the adjudicating 
authority cannot appreciate and adjudicate the SCN’s and the order of 
remand to the tribunal is erroneous and High Court at the most could have 
remanded the matter to the adjudicating authority, if at all it was warranted 

and not to the tribunal. Hence, on these grounds, he seeks for setting aside 
the order of the High Court and allowing the appeals. 
 
8. 
Shri V.C. Bharathi, learned counsel appearing for the respondent 
would support the impugned order and by reiterating the contentions urged 
in the counter affidavit and prays for dismissal of the appeal. He would also 
contend that the appellant has been successfully dodging the adjudication 
process on one pretext or the other and the so-called letter dated 20.01.2001 
which had been directed by the CESTAT by Order dated 06.09.2006 to be 
furnished to the appellant is the letter of the appellant itself, which 
undisputedly was an explanation offered by the appellant with reference to 
alleged shortfall and excess storage of fabrics. He would also contend that 
mere reference to a document in the show cause notice itself need not be 
construed as if reliance having been placed by the authority on the said 
document so as to draw inference against the appellant, unless the show 
cause notice says so. He would further contend that until and unless appellant 
is able to establish prejudice on account of non-furnishing of the document 
and it would not be in a position to reply to the show cause notice, such plea 
of non-furnishing of the document ought not to be entertained. Hence, he 
would support the impugned order and prays for dismissal of the appeals. 
 
9. 
Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and on 
perusal of the impugned order, it would emerge there from that undisputedly 

at the first instance when the respondent adjudicated the show cause notices 
dated 11.05.2001 and 20.01.2001 it had resulted in an order dated 28.02.2006 
being passed which landed by way of two appeals in final order No.838 to 
840 of 2006 before CESTAT and tribunal by order dated 06.09.2006 had 
observed to the following effect: 
 
“4. It has been asserted by the company’s representative that they want 
to rely upon all documents not relied upon in the SCNs, for the purpose 
of contesting the allegations contained in the notices. Admittedly, these 
documents were received by them by 30.12.2005. The cases were 
posted for personal hearing to 25th January, 2006. On that day, the 
company’s representative appeared before the Commissioner and 
requested for some more time for perusal of the documents. A renewed 
request was made for a copy of the aforesaid letter dated 20.01.2001 
also. However, it appears, no more opportunity was given to the party 
and learned Commissioner chose to pass the impugned orders on 
28.02.2006. We have found an element of denial of natural justice in 
these proceedings of the Commissioner. Learned Commissioner ought 
to have given a reasonable time to the party to peruse the voluminous 
records for the purpose of preparing replies to the SCNs. He appears to 
have passed the impugned orders in haste. 
 
5. In the result, we set aside the impugned orders and allow these 
appeals by way of remand, directing learned Commissioner to (a) 
supply a copy of the aforesaid letter dated 20.01.2001 (and enclosures 
thereof) to the appellants (b) allow them a period of four weeks 
thereafter for perusal of all records (c) allow them a reasonable 
opportunity of being personally heard (which shall not be less than 7 
days from the date of filing of replies to the SCNs and (d) pass speaking 
orders in accordance with law within 8 weeks from the date of personal 
hearing. As the party has undertaken to co-operate with the proceedings 
of the Commissioner, they are mandated to appear before the 
Commission for being heard on the date appointed by him.” 
 
10. 
A perusal of the above direction issued by the tribunal would indicate 
that respondent was directed to supply the copy of the letter dated 20.01.2001 
(and enclosures thereof) to the appellant and pass orders after affording 
reasonable opportunity of the personal hearing. 

11. 
In the teeth of the above direction the respondent herein has passed 
an order afresh on 21.11.2008 and 27.11.2008 adjudicating the two show 
cause notices issued earlier. The fact remains that copy of the letter dated 
20.01.2001 along with enclosures were not furnished pursuant to the 
aforesaid directions issued by the tribunal by the adjudicating authority. In 
fact, request for furnishing the same came to be reiterated by the appellant in 
the de novo proceedings adjudications of 2 SCN’s and it has been observed 
by the adjudicating authority itself vide paragraph 19 of the order dated 
21.11.2008 and paragraph 9 of the order dated 27.11.2008 respectively to the 
following effect: 
“19. At the time of personal hearing held on 21.04.2008 before the 
undersigned, Shri M. Ramasubramanian, Manager (Excise) 
appeared. He requested that MCL either be supplied with a copy of 
the document (letter dated 20.01.2001 with enclosures) as directed 
by CESTAT or be informed of the non-availability of the same so as 
to file rely. In this connection, he also gave a written representation. 
A communication was sent to them on 14.07.2008 informing that, 
MCL projected before the CESTAT as if a copy of the said letter 
dated 20.01.2001 was not made available to them; whereas, vide 
their letter dated 22.06.2002, MCL fairly admitted receipt of copies 
of all documents relied on in the notice; even if they had misplaced 
their copy as stated before CESTAT copies of the said letter with 
enclosures should have been available with MCL; and therefore they 
may file reply to the notice. The communication also mentioned the 
dates on which MCL was free to appear for hearing. At the time of 
hearing held on 16.09.2008, Shri S.S. Thakkur, Vice President 
(Excise & Legal) appeared along with Shri M. Ramasubramanian, 
Manager (Excise). They filed reply with reconciliation statements. It 
was argued that there was no evidence to prove clandestine removal 
and hence demand made in the notice would not survive. They 
accordingly, requested for dropping the proceedings.” 
 
“9. At the time of personal hearing held on 21.04.2008 before the 
undersigned, Shri. M. Ramasubramanian, Manager (Excise) 
appeared. He requested that MCL either be supplied with a copy of 
the document (letter dated 20.01.2001 with enclosures) as directed 

by CESTAT or be informed of the non-availability of the same so as 
to file reply. In this connection, he also gave a written representation. 
A communication was sent to them on 14.07.2008 informing that, 
MCL projected before the CESTAT as if a copy of the said letter was 
not made available to them; whereas, vide their letter dated 
22.06.2002, MCL fairly admitted receipt of copies of all the 
documents relied on in the notice; even if they misplaced their copy 
as stated before CESTAT, copies of the said letter with enclosures 
should have been available with MCL; and therefore 
 they may 
file reply to the notice. The communication also mentioned the dates 
on which MCL was free to appear for hearing. At the time of hearing 
held on 16.09.2008, Shri. S.S. Thakur, Vice-President (Excise & 
Legal) appeared along with Shri. M Ramasubramanian, Manager 
(Excise). They filed reply with reconciliation statements. It was 
orally argued that since there was no evidence for clandestine 
removal, the proceedings should be dropped.” 

12. 
The direction issued by the tribunal undisputedly has got merged 
with order dated 27.11.2008 it would be apt and appropriate to note at this 
juncture itself the contention raised by Shri Shekhar Naphade, learned Senior 
Counsel which is to the effect that by virtue of the direction issued by the 
tribunal under its order dated 06.09.2006 having attained finality, the 
authorities subordinate to the CESTAT having failed to comply with the 
directions so issued should have resulted in automatic allowing of the 
appeals by the High Court, though at first blush looks attractive, same cannot 
be accepted for reasons more than one. Firstly, the direction so issued by the 
tribunal on 06.09.2006 included a direction to the respondent to pass orders 
afresh which had resulted in respondent passing the orders on 21.11.2008 
and 27.11.2008 respectively. Secondly, the High Court under the impugned 
order has itself observed that letter dated 20.01.2001 has not been relied upon 
by the revenue as an adverse document against the assessee while 

adjudicating the SCN’s. The observation made by the High Court is to the 
following effect: 
“14. At this juncture, we would like to point out that the said letter, 
dated 20.01.2001 is not relied on by the Revenue as an adverse 
document against the assessee. On the other hand, it is the document 
of the assessee themselves, that too, an explanation given by them to 
the short fall and excess of the fabrics. Only when a document relied 
on adversely against the assessee, if not supplied to the assessee 
before passing the order of adjudication, such non furnishing may be 
construed as an act in violation of principles of natural justice. In this 
case it is not so.” 

Thirdly, it has been the consistent stand of the respondent-department that 
the said letter was in fact supplied to the assessee’s representative and the 
same has been discussed in threadbare by the High Court under the impugned 
order which is to the following effect: 
 
“15. Even otherwise, as pointed by the learned senior panel counsel 
for the second respondent, it is evident that the said letter was in fact 
supplied to the assessee’s representative on 26.02.2002, in view of 
the acknowledgment made by one R. Manoharan stating that he 
received Xerox copies of all relied upon documents (except S.No. 
15), mentioned in the show cause notice no. 20 of 2001 and 30 of 
2001 from the superintending of Central Excise, HBQ, Madurai. 
Thus it is contended by the Revenue that the copy of the letter dated 
20.01.2001 was already furnished to the assessee and therefore 
principles of natural justice was not violated. We find force in the 
said submission not only based on such acknowledgement on 
26.02.2002 and also in view of the assessee’s own communication, 
dated 19.08.2004 addressed to the Commissioner of Central Excise, 
Tirunelveli, requesting him to once again provide copies of four 
documents, out of which, one is the said letter, dated 20.01.2001. 
The said letter reads as follows:- 

The Commissioner of Central Excise, 
Central Excise Revenue Building 
NGO “A” Colony, 
Tirunelveli-627 007 
Sir, 

Sub: Show Cause Notice No.20 of 2001, dated 
2.11.2001 and No.30 of 2001, dated 11.5.2001. 
 
This refers to our letter dated 5th July 2004 and your office 
response letter dated 8th July 2004 on the above subject. 
 
We humbly submit that we are in the process of preparing reply 
to the above show cause notices. We once again bring to your 
kind notice that in view of closure of our unit Madura Fabrics 
Division in early 2002 to which the above show cause notices 
were issued and due to non-availability of Personnel who handled 
excise records during the relevant period, we are even unable to 
trace out certain documents/statements which were relied upon in 
the show cause notices and said to have been received by us. We 
therefore, request you to place once again provide us copies of the 
following documents and statements given by out personnel for 
our perusal and then prepare proper reply to the above show cause 
notice. 
 
Documents and Statements. 
1. 
Chemical 
Examiner 
letters 
issued 
from 
File 
No.LCx.52/S/636/200-01, dated 7.3.2001 and 10.4.2001. 
2. Statement dated 30.4.2001 given by Sri R. Murali Narayanan, 
Information Technology Manager. 
3. A file containing letter dated 20.1.2001 along with the 
enclosures-64 sheets. 
4. Statement dated 20.4.2001 given by Mr. R. Nallasivan, Sales 
Executive-5 sheets. 
 
We submit that it is not out intention to unnecessarily defer 
submission of reply to the show cause notice but we are 
handicapped in tracing out the relevant records, invoices, stock 
registers etc., including documents which were relied upon in the 
show cause notice, due to non-availability of concerned 
personnel. 
We therefore humbly request you to please provide us time upto 
October 2004 to trace out all the relevant documents, study and 
prepare proper reply to the show-cause notice. 
We extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused. 
 
Thanking you, 
 
Yours faithfully, 
For MADURAI COATS PRIVATE LIMITED.

13. 
In fact, the High Court has opined and rightly so that the said letter 
dated 20.01.2001 (with enclosures) which is claimed by the appellant has not 
having been furnished is only a ruse for not replying to the show cause 
notices and it would in no way prejudice the appellant’s claim, particularly 
in the background of reliance not having been placed by the respondent-
authority for adjudicating the SCN’s and in the absence of prejudice having 
been caused to the appellant no fault can be laid at the doors of the 
respondent. It would be of benefit to note that observations made by the High 
Court in this regard and same is to the following effect: 
“19. Admittedly, the said letter, dated 20.01.2001 is not available 
with the Revenue. It is claimed by the assessee that copy of the said 
letter is also not available with the assessee. We have already pointed 
out that the said letter with enclosures had emanated only from the 
assessee and therefore, it is their own document. We have also 
pointed out that the said letter is nothing but an explanation regarding 
the alleged short fall and excess of the fabrics. Therefore, it was for 
the assessee to give a suitable reply to the show cause notices, as the 
contents of the said letter was already discussed by the 
Commissioner in the show cause notices itself. Therefore, the 
assessee is not entitled to contend as if they were not in a position to 
furnish reply to the show cause notice without furnishing a copy of 
the said letter, dated 20.01.2001. Referring a document in the show 
cause notice itself need not be construed as though a reliance is also 
placed by such authority on such document to take an adverse 
inference against the assessee, unless the show cause notice itself 
explicitly expresses so. Referring a document in a show cause notice 
does not mean relying upon the same as well, unless such reliance 
against the assessee is apparently evident on the face of such notice. 
 
20. Even otherwise, the assessee must show and establish that such 
non-furnishing of a particular document caused them prejudice and 
that they are prevented from giving an effective reply to the show 
cause notice. Certainly, a document which was either not within the 
knowledge of the assessee or not emanated from them, if relied on 
in the show cause notice, that too, by taking adverse inference 
against the assessee based on such document, then non-furnishing of 

such document would certainly result in causing prejudice to the 
assessee. On the other hand, if such document itself has emanated 
from the assessee and not from any third party or the Revenue and if 
the same was also not considered to draw any adverse inference 
against the assessee to form a prima facie opinion in the show cause 
notice, non-furnishing of such document to the assessee itself would 
not be construed as causing prejudice to the assessee. It is not beyond 
one’s reasonable expectation that an assessee who sent a 
communication to the Revenue, would certainly retain a copy of the 
same in their file, especially when the proceedings are going on and 
not get terminated. If they did not retain a copy of such document or 
if it is lost from their hand, the assessee has to blame themselves. In 
this Scenario, the question of prejudice does not arise. At the best, it 
could be treated as prejudice caused by self-default or 
predetermination and not a prejudice caused at the instance of the 
Revenue.” 

14. 
Though, we are in complete agreement with the contention raised by 
Shri Shekhar Naphade that order of review or modification which came to 
be passed on 08.03.2010 is without sanctity of law deserves to be accepted 
in the light of the findings recorded at paragraph 25 to 29 of the impugned 
order and we affirm the same, yet for the reason that matter has now been 
remanded back to the tribunal for adjudicating the SCN’s afresh dissuade us 
from setting aside the impugned order. 
 
15. 
The High Court has also rightly not remitted the matter to the 
adjudicating authority for considering the matter afresh and the findings of 
the High Court recorded under the impugned order in paragraph 19 and 20 
referred to supra having been affirmed by us herein above, yet we deem it 
appropriate to reserve the liberty to the appellant to urge all contentions 
before the tribunal including the one urged before this Court namely to 

demonstrate as to how prejudice has been caused to the appellant by non-
furnishing of the said letter dated 20.01.2001 (with enclosures) and 
contentions of both parties are kept open and the order of remand made to 
the tribunal by the High Court under the impugned order would stand 
affirmed subject to the above observations. Accordingly, the appeals stand 
disposed of with no order as to costs.
