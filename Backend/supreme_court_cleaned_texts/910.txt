 APPELLANT(s) 

VERSUS 
UNION OF INDIA AND ORS. 
 
 RESPONDENT(s) 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
K.V. Viswanathan, J. 
1. 
This appeal challenges the order of the Armed Forces 
Tribunal (AFT) Regional Bench, Lucknow dated 05.01.2022 in 
Original Application No. 241 of 2021. By the said order, the AFT 
dismissed the application of the appellant and declined her prayer 
for reliefs similar to the ones granted by the judgment dated 
22.01.2014 of the AFT Principal Bench in O.A. No. 111 of 2013 
and batch, to the applicants therein. The appellant claims that those 
applicants were identically situated with her. 

2. 
The appellant on 10.03.2008 was commissioned as a Short 
Service Commissioned Officer in the Army Dental Corps (AD 
Corps). She was at that time 27 years 11 months and 28 days of age. 
The regulation, as it then stood, entitled her to three chances for 
taking up the departmental examination for permanent commission. 
It also provided extension of age limit. The relevant clauses, 
namely, Para 12 of Army Instruction 15 of 79 and Para 4(a) and 
4(b) of AI 37 of 78 read as under: 
“…Officers granted Short Service Commission will 
be given three chances for taking up the departmental 
examination for permanent commission. Two 
chances will be given after completion of 2 years of 
service and before completion of 4 years of service 
and third chance in extended tenure after completion 
of 5 years of service and before completion of 8 years 
of service provided they fulfill the conditions of 
eligibility as laid down in AI 37/78, as amended.” 
Paras 4(a) and 4(b) of Annexure ‘A’ to the AI 37/78 
“(a) Candidates must not have attained 28 years of 
age on 31st December of the year of receipt of 
application from them. This age limit may be 
extended upto 30 years by the Government of India 
on the recommendation of the AD Corps Selection 
Board in the case of candidates with additional Post-
Graduate qualifications. 

(b) A candidate with previous commissioned service 
in the Army Dental Corps will be entitled to extension 
of the above age limits as given below:- 
Full period of previous reckonable service if such 
service was rendered while in possession of dental 
qualification recognized by the Dental Council of 
India (vide para 3 above).” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
3. 
It is undisputed that the appellant could not qualify in the first 
two chances on completion of two years of service and four years 
of service respectively. On 15.11.2012, her services were extended 
for another five years. By 9th of March 2013 the appellant had 
completed five years of service and was eligible to avail of her third 
chance, subject to age relaxation up to the full period of reckonable 
service. 
4. 
However, on 20th of March, 2013, amendments were carried 
out to clause 4(a) and 4(b) of AI 37 of 78 as amended in AI 15 of 
79, inasmuch as, while Para 4(a) was amended, Para 4(b) came to 
be deleted. The amended Para 4(a) of AI 37 of 78 introduced on 
20.03.2013, reads as under: 
“(a) Para 4(a) of Annexure ‘A’ to AI 37/78 

Candidates must not have attained 30 years of age on 
31st December of the year of receipt of application 
form from them for Departmental Permanent 
Commission. The age limit may be extended up to 35 
years in respect of those candidates who are in receipt 
of PG qualification of Masters in Dental Surgery duly 
recognized by Dental Council of India, at the time of 
initial commission to Army Dental Corps.” 
5. 
The net result was the appellant was deprived of her third 
chance since the extension was capped at 35 years and was confined 
to those who were in receipt of PG qualification of Masters in 
Dental Surgery on and from 20.03.2013. 
6. 
According to the appellant, Officers similarly situated with 
the appellant who were also not given an opportunity to appear for 
the clinical test and interview, in view of the amendment, quickly 
moved applications before the AFT, Principal Bench in O.A. No. 
111 of 2013 and batch of matters raising various contentions and 
contended that they have been wrongly deprived of availing the 
third chance for no fault of theirs. Though the amendments to the 
policy were upheld, the Principal Bench of the AFT granted relief 
in the following terms in the said batch of matters. 

“35. The other contention of the learned counsel for 
the petitioners is that the Government can grant age 
relaxation in the given facts and circumstances of the 
case. It is trite that the Government has the power to 
relax the upper age limit if it is found that operation 
of the rule or policy has hardship on the persons 
working in the Corps. Nothing has been shown that 
the Government has no power to relax the upper age 
limit. Now coming to the question as to whether the 
operation of the policy has hardship, it would be seen 
that an exception was provided for SSC Officers for 
giving the benefit by extending the upper age limit. It 
is also admitted by the respondents in para-41 of their 
counter that one time age relaxation in the upper age 
limit has been granted in the case of an AMC officer 
who had joined as SSC Officer prior to the issuance 
of the impugned amendment. By deletion of para-4(b) 
some of the SSC Officers became ineligible for 
permanent absorption. The petitioners, who were 
working in the Corps continuously, expected to be 
given three chances to seek their permanent 
absorption. However, due to impugned amendment, 
they have been denied these chances. Therefore, as 
one time exception, the Government can relax the 
upper age limit in respect of those petitioners who 
have become ineligible on account of the impugned 
amendment. 
36. In view of the above discussions, all the four 
petitions stand partly allowed with following 
directions:- 
(1) The impugned policy of 2013 is held to be intra 
vires. 
(2) A direction is issued to the respondents to consider 
the case of the petitioners, who were eligible in the 
year 2012 but became ineligible in the year 2013 for 

grant of permanent absorption on account of 
amendment of policy after clubbing the selection of 
2012 with 2013. Their case shall be considered in 
terms of the previous policy. 
(3) A further direction is issued to the respondents to 
grant one time age relaxation in favour of the 
petitioners for seeking permanent absorption as has 
been done in the case of AMC officers who had joined 
as SSC Officer prior to the issuance of the impugned 
amendment. The entire exercise for consideration of 
the petitioners for grant of permanent commission 
shall be completed within a period of two months 
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. The 
petitioners’ case thereafter shall be considered by the 
ensuing Board for their permanent absorption in the 
Corps.” 
 
7. 
According to the appellant, she could not join the applicants 
therein in the litigation as she was in her advance stage of 
pregnancy and while posted at Bareilly, she proceeded on maternity 
leave on 16.05.2013. The appellant delivered a child on 01.07.2013. 
8. 
Consequent to the order of the Principal Bench, permanent 
commissions were granted to officers who were eligible prior to the 
amendment to avail a third chance but could not avail in view of 
the amendment of 20.03.2013. The appellant was not considered 
because she was not part of the Original Application. 

9. 
A representation submitted by the appellant on 06.09.2014 did 
not yield any favorable result and was rejected with the following 
endorsement on 15.09.2014:- 
“1. Ref advance copy of your application No DS-
12301/05/2004 dated 06 Sep 2014. 
2. As per directions of MoD communicated vide 
DGAFMS letter No12252/CC/AKJ/DGAFMS/LC 
dated 12 Aug 2014, hon'ble Armed Forces Tribunal 
(Principal Bench). New Delhi has granted ‘one time' 
age relaxation in the eligibility criteria 'only to the 
petitioners'. Hon'ble AFT has further clarified that 
this order will not form a precedence. 
3. For your info please.” 
 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
10. At the outset itself, we may say that the phrase “Only to the 
Petitioners” in the order rejecting the representation is patently 
erroneous. While the AFT Principal Bench granted relief to the 
petitioners, it did not prohibit the department from considering 
similarly situated persons. Another representation was disposed of 
on 9th November 2017, inter alia, on the primary ground that she 
did not meet the criterion. In the meantime, the appellant’s services 
were further extended for a period of 4 years on 31.10.2017. 

11. The appellant thereafter filed Original Application No. 241 of 
2021 before the AFT, Regional Bench, Lucknow seeking relief 
similar to the ones granted to the batch of petitioners in O.A. 111 
of 2013 by AFT, Principal Bench, New Delhi which attained 
finality. For the sake of completion of record, it should be 
mentioned that the appellant had in 2014 itself moved to the Armed 
Forces Tribunal by filing an application in Diary No. 1761of 2014. 
However, the said application was withdrawn with liberty to move 
afresh. Thereafter, again she filed O.A. 70 of 2017 before the 
Principal Bench which was again withdrawn with liberty to move 
the appropriate Tribunal. It was thereafter that after making the 
representation on 4th October 2017 which was rejected on 
09.11.2017 and after returning from the Arunachal Pradesh posting 
and further after the Covid-19 ordeal had reasonably subsided in 
January, 2021, she moved the AFT, Regional Bench, Lucknow by 
filing O.A. No. 241 of 2021, which has been dismissed by the 
impugned order. 

12. The only reasoning given in the impugned order is in the 
following terms. 
“(d) The applicant was not a petitioner in those 
petitions filed before AFT (PB), New Delhi, 
therefore, applicant cannot be granted any relief with 
regard to relaxation of age limit which is clarified by 
AFT (PB) in its judgment dated 22.01.2014 that ‘an 
officer is not entitled to be absorbed permanent, if 
he/she has crossed the upper age limits’. The benefit 
of age relaxation was granted to the petitioners of 
Original Applications who were eligible in the year 
2012 but became ineligible in the year 2013 for grant 
of permanent absorption on account of amendment of 
policy after clubbing the selection of 2012 with 2013 
considering the terms of the previous policy and were 
granted one time age relaxation.” 
13. We have heard Ms. Vibha Datta Makhija, learned senior 
counsel for the appellant and Mr. R Balasubramanian, learned 
senior counsel for the respondents. Having considered the 
submissions of the learned counsels and perused the records, we are 
of the opinion that the appellant is entitled to parity with those 
applicants who succeeded before the AFT, Principal Bench in O.A. 
No. 111 of 2013. We say so for the following reasons. 
14. It is a well settled principle of law that where a citizen 

aggrieved by an action of the government department has 
approached the court and obtained a declaration of law in his/her 
favour, others similarly situated ought to be extended the benefit 
without the need for them to go to court. [See Amrit Lal Berry vs. 
Collector of Central Excise, New Delhi and Others, (1975) ] 
15. In K.I. Shephard and Others vs. Union of India and Others, 
(1987), this Court while reinforcing the above principle 
held as under:- 
“19. The writ petitions and the appeals must succeed. 
We set aside the impugned judgments of the Single 
Judge and Division Bench of the Kerala High Court 
and direct that each of the three transferee banks 
should take over the excluded employees on the same 
terms and conditions of employment under the 
respective banking companies prior to amalgamation. 
The employees would be entitled to the benefit of 
continuity of service for all purposes including salary 
and perks throughout the period. We leave it open to 
the transferee banks to take such action as they 
consider 
proper 
against 
these 
employees 
in 
accordance with law. Some of the excluded 
employees have not come to court. There is no 
justification to penalise them for not having litigated. 
They too shall be entitled to the same benefits as the 
petitioners. ….” 
 (Emphasis Supplied) 

16. No doubt, in exceptional cases where the court has expressly 
prohibited the extension of the benefit to those who have not 
approached the court till then or in cases where a grievance in 
personam is redressed, the matter may acquire a different 
dimension, and the department may be justified in denying the 
relief to an individual who claims the extension of the benefit of the 
said judgment. 
17. That is not the situation here. In the submissions too, the 
respondents have not been able to point out any valid justification 
as to how the applicants who obtained the benefit from the AFT, 
Principal Bench in OA No. 111 of 2013 and batch are not 
identically situated with the appellant. Like the applicants who 
succeeded, the appellant was also ripe for the third chance before 
the amended para 4(a) of AI No. 37 of 1978 was introduced on 
20.03.2013. The Principal Bench of the AFT in OA No. 111 of 
2013 after clearly holding that the applicants therein were denied 
the third chance directed consideration of their cases for permanent 
absorption by granting one-time age relaxation by considering them 

under the unamended policy. 
18. The respondent authorities on their own should have extended 
the benefit of the judgment of AFT, Principal Bench in OA No.111 
of 2013 and batch to the appellant. To illustrate, take the case of 
the valiant Indian soldiers bravely guarding the frontiers at Siachen 
or in other difficult terrain. Thoughts on conditions of service and 
job perquisites will be last in their mind. Will it be fair to tell them 
that they will not be given relief even if they are similarly situated, 
since the judgment they seek to rely on, was passed in the case of 
certain applicants alone who moved the court? We think that would 
be a very unfair scenario. Accepting the stand of the respondents in 
this case would result in this Court putting its imprimatur on an 
unreasonable stand adopted by the authorities. 
19. The stand of the Department relying on the judgment of this 
Court in State of Maharashtra and Another vs. Chandrakant 
Anant Kulkarni and Others, (1981) to contend that 
mere reduction in chance of consideration did not result in 
deprivation of any right does not appeal to us. The appellant’s case 

is founded on the principle of discrimination. What is sauce for the 
goose ought to be sauce for the gander. If the applicants in O.A. 
No. 111 of 2013 whom we find are identically situated to the 
appellant were found to be eligible to be given a third chance for 
promotion, because they acquired eligibility before the amendment 
to AI No. 37 of 1978 on 20.03.2013, we find no reason why the 
appellant should not be treated alike. 
20. The order dated 13.03.2014 in the application for clarification 
of the AFT, Principal Bench, order of 22.01.2014 and the order 
dated 19.05.2014 in the review relied upon in the counter affidavit 
do not in any manner dilute the case of the appellant herein. In fact, 
the order dated 13.03.2014 fully supports the appellant since it 
extended the benefit to those persons who acquired the eligibility 
in 2013. As far as the order in review dated 19.05.2014 directing 
that there would be no dilution in the laid down criterion and the 
further direction that the order in review shall not form a precedent 
does not imply that the main order of 22.01.2014 of the Principal 
Bench, AFT, should not be extended to similarly situated 

individuals like the appellant, who has been knocking the doors for 
relief since September, 2014. 
21. We see no delay in the appellant approaching the Tribunal. 
The appellant has been seeking justice from 2014 and the only 
delay between 2017 to 2021 after the withdrawal of the earlier 
applications with liberty, was due to the fact that between August, 
2017 and 2019 she was posted in Arunachal Pradesh and it was 
during this time that the appellant made a second representation. 
Thereafter, the period between March, 2020 and January, 2021 was 
on account of Covid-19 pandemic. In any event, since a clear case 
of discrimination has been made out, we do not want to non-suit the 
appellant on the ground of delay. We say so on the special facts of 
this case. 
22. We also find that the appellant - a woman officer has 
continuously worked since 2007 and even as late as on 31.10.2017, 
she was granted extension of another four years of service, and she 
continues to be in service thereafter also on account of the status 
quo granted by this Court on 08.03.2022. Not only this, the 

appellant was awarded Commendation Card by the Chief of Army 
Staff on 14.01.2019. It is also undisputed that the appellant has had 
a distinguished service and is now posted as Lieutenant Colonel in 
the Army Dental Corps at Agra. 
23. We hold that the appellant was wrongly excluded from 
consideration when other similarly situated officers were 
considered and granted permanent commission. Today, eleven 
years have elapsed. It will not be fair to subject her to the rigors of 
the 2013 parameters as she is now nearly 45 years of age. There 
has been no fault on the part of the appellant. 
24. On the peculiar facts of this case and since nothing adverse 
has been placed on record with regard to performance of the 
appellant, in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the 
Constitution, we direct that the appellant ought to be given 
Permanent Commission. We direct that the appellant’s case be 
taken up for grant of Permanent Commission and she be extended 
the benefit of Permanent Commission with effect from the same 
date the similarly situated persons who obtained benefits pursuant 

to the judgment dated 22.01.2014 in O.A. No. 111 of 2013 of the 
Principal Bench of the AFT. All consequential benefits like 
seniority, promotion and monetary benefits, including arrears shall 
be extended to the appellant. The above directions shall be 
implemented within a period of four weeks from today. 
25. The appeal is allowed and the order of the AFT, Regional 
Bench, Lucknow, dated 05.01.2022 in O. A. No. 241of 2021 is 
quashed and set aside. No costs.
