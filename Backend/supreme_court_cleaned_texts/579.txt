IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA 
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
 
RAJKOT MUNICIPAL 
CORPORATION 

 … APPELLANT 
VERSUS 
STATE OF GUJARAT 
AND ORS.... RESPONDENTS 
 
JUDGMENT 
AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. 
1. This Appeal challenges the Order dated 07.07.2016 
(hereinafter referred to as “Impugned Order”) in 
Special passed by 
High Court of Gujarat wherein the Appellant herein 
being Rajkot Municipal Corporation (hereinafter 
referred to as “Appellant-Corporation”) was directed 
to refund a portion of the property tax, which was 
paid by the Respondent No. 02 herein, namely, 
Avenue Supermarts Limited. Respondent No. 02 had 
assailed the demand raised by Appellant-Corporation 
seeking payment of property tax for the Assessment 

Year (hereinafter referred to as ‘AY’) 2015-16 along 
with outstanding arrears of such tax dues amounting 
to INR 2,97,02,324/- (Rupees Two Crores Ninety-
Seven Lakhs Two Thousand Three Hundred and 
Twenty-Four Only). As a consequence to the non-
fulfilment of aforesaid payment of dues by the 
predecessor-in-interest holder of the property, the 
premises were sealed on 21.03.2016 with prior 
indication to the Respondent No. 02. 
2. The High Court of Gujarat vide Impugned Order had 
allowed the Special Civil Application moved by the 
Respondent No. 02 on the ground that the said 
Respondent cannot be made liable for the payment of 
arrears of property tax which arose prior to the 
acquisition of ownership, that is, prior to 03.09.2015. 
The High Court deprecated the approach of the 
Appellant-Corporation 
in 
charging 
exorbitant 
amount of dues from Respondent No. 02 as well as 
the uncalled inclusion of further interest and penalty 
on such outstanding arrears, which had already been 
challenged by the predecessor and had been stayed 
by the competent court. Considering the said 
circumstances, 
the 
High 
Court 
directed 
the 

Appellant-Corporation to retain a portion of the 
property tax to the tune of INR 14,85,000/- (Rupees 
Fourteen Lakhs and Eighty-Five Thousand Only) 
relating to the relevant AY 2015-16 for which 
Respondent No. 02 had acquired ownership and 
possession, that is, from 03.09.2015 and to refund 
the rest of the amount of property tax along with 
simple interest at 6 per cent per annum from the date 
of recovery till the actual payment of refund. In 
compliance with the aforesaid direction qua refund 
by the High Court, the Appellant-Corporation has 
already refunded such quantum of excessive property 
tax to the Respondent No. 02. 
3. Aggrieved by the direction to make the refund of 
accrued amount of property tax dues, the Appellant-
Corporation is assailing the Impugned Order before 
this Court. 
4. It is the case of the Appellant-Corporation that the 
Impugned Order directing the refund of property tax 
is contrary to the provisions of Sections 139 and 140 
of the Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 
1949 (hereinafter referred to as “GPMC Act 1949”). It 
is argued that a Commissioner, by virtue of Sub-

Section (1) of Section 140 of the GPMC Act 1949, is 
empowered to recover such outstanding property tax 
dues from an occupier where a person primarily 
liable to pay the tax, after being duly served with 
demand notice, has failed to make the payment 
thereof. Moreover, as per Sub-Section (4) of Section 
140 of the GPMC Act 1949, such occupier may credit 
the said payment from a person who was primarily 
liable to discharge the liability of such dues. Thus, it 
was argued that from a cumulative reading of 
Sections 139 and 140 of the GPMC Act 1949, the 
Appellant-Corporation was justified in recovering 
arrears from Respondent No. 02. 
5., it is contended by Respondent No. 02 that 
the property in question which is a commercial 
complex known as Shivlink-IV bearing City Survey 
No. 5095/1B, 5095/1C(P), Plot No. 68, situated at 
Gondal Road, Rajkot, was acquired via Deed of 
Conveyance dated 03.09.2015 from its predecessor-
in-interest, that is, Respondent Nos. 04 and 05. 
Respondent No. 02 would be liable for the payment of 
property tax from the date of acquisition of ownership 
and not for any period before this date, as affirmed 

by the High Court. Respondent No. 02 points out that 
Respondent No. 03, the lessee of the property prior to 
03.09.2015, has challenged similar tax demands for 
earlier years in both civil court and the High Court, 
resulting in a stay on recovery actions. Consequently, 
it was argued that until the conclusion of 
adjudication of such pending appeals pertaining to 
the arrears of any period before 03.05.2015, the 
Appellant-Corporation cannot make recovery of the 
said amount from Respondent No. 02. 
6. Furthermore, the Appellant-Corporation as well as 
the Respondent Nos. 04 and 05 have relied on Letter 
dated 18.01.2016, whereby it was stated that the 
Respondent No. 02 had kept INR 2,50,00,000/- 
(Rupees Two Crores and Fifty Lakhs only) as a token 
of assurance from Respondent Nos. 04 and 05 for 
clearing arrears of property tax. As argued, this letter 
was intended to ensure that in case of failure of 
payment of such arrears by the Respondent Nos. 04 
and 05 (predecessor owners), it shall be incumbent 
on the Respondent No. 02 (subsequent owner) to 
make 
the 
payment 
thereof. 
Addressing 
this 
argument, Respondent No. 02 contended that mere 

deposit of security amount by Respondent Nos. 04 
and 05 would not tantamount to assignment of 
liability for payment of tax for a period for which 
Respondent No. 02 did not have ownership. 
Appellant-Corporation cannot be allowed to ascribe 
obligation upon Respondent No. 02 to seek remedy of 
refund from Respondent Nos. 04 and 05. 
7. Having heard the Senior Counsel for the Appellant-
Corporation as well as the Respondents, it is 
imperative to decipher the undisputed facts along 
with the applicable provisions of the GPMC Act 1949. 
8. The relevant factual backdrop leading to the present 
Impugned Order commenced from the point where 
the original owner of the said property, namely, M/s 
Platinum Associates (hereinafter referred to as 
“original owner”) entered into a Lease Agreement 
dated 01.12.2007 with Respondent No. 03 herein, 
namely, Reliance Communications Limited for an 
office space. Subsequently, the original owner sold 
the said property to Prabha Kantilal Pohkiya and 
Jyoti Rakesh Gandhi (Respondent Nos. 04 and 05 
respectively) 
vide 
Conveyance 
Deed 
dated 
05.12.2007. It needs mention here that Respondent 

No. 03 continued to occupy the premises, thereupon, 
Respondent No. 02 purchased the said property from 
Respondent Nos. 04 and 05 through a Deed of 
Conveyance dated 03.09.2015. 
9. Appellant-Corporation had raised several demand 
notices for payment of outstanding property tax on 
the premises starting from the year 2008. A Notice 
dated 29.07.2010 was issued by the Appellant-
Corporation calling upon the Respondent No. 03, 
being in possession of the said property, to pay 
outstanding arrears of property tax along with 
penalty and other charges to the tune of INR 
1,33,48,898/- (Rupees One Crores Thirty-Three 
Lakhs Forty-Eight Thousand Eight Hundred and 
Ninety-Eight Only) for the period commencing from 
01.06.2008. The said demand was assailed by 
Respondent No. 03 by filing Municipal Appeal No. 19 
of 2010 before the Civil Court, Rajkot, wherein 
Respondent No. 03 deposited 75% of the bill amount 
in Court. Thereafter, for AY 2011-12, demand notice 
was issued to the Respondent No. 03 seeking 
payment of property tax for the said AY as well as the 
arrears thereof, which was also challenged by 

Respondent No. 03 before Civil Court in Municipal 
Appeal No. 1639 of 2011, where again 75% of the bill 
amount was deposited. It is pertinent to note that 
both these appeals are pending before the Civil Court 
with the stay on the deposit of the remaining 25% bill 
amounts continues. 
10. Similar were the demands for the AYs 2012-13 and 
2013-14, which were challenged before the High 
Court in Special 
on the ground of retrospectively charging of the 
arrears of property tax by the Appellant-Corporation. 
The said Application was disposed of vide Order 
dated 04.04.2014 with a direction to the Appellant-
Corporation to serve a copy of the demand notices to 
the Respondent No. 03 in view of the uncertainty 
surrounding receipt of such notice. Further, the 
Appellant-Corporation was directed to consider the 
objections to be raised by Respondent No. 03 before 
issuing 
fresh 
bills. 
The 
Appellant-Corporation 
consequent to the above order proceeded to issue 
another demand notice for the AY 2014-15 upon 
Respondent No. 03 seeking payment of property tax 
inclusive of earlier arrears to the tune of INR 

2,51,09,857/- (Rupees Two Crores Fifty-One Lakhs 
Nine Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifty-Seven Only). 
Respondent No. 03 then initiated a challenge against 
the said demand notices issued for the AYs 2012-13, 
2013-14 and 2014-15 before High Court in Special, wherein the High 
Court vide its Order dated 07.07.2016, directed a 
stay on the further recovery subject to payment of 
INR 60,00,000/- (Rupees Sixty Lakhs Only) as an 
interim measure, which would operate pending the 
appeal challenging the said recovery for the aforesaid 
three AYs. It was clarified that the said direction for 
stay would automatically vacate in the event of non-
filing of an appeal assailing the demand for the said 
AYs. 
11. The present dispute arises from Demand Notice dated 
11.03.2016 which was issued by the Appellant-
Corporation to Respondent No. 02, seeking not only 
the payment of property tax for the AY 2015-16 but 
also the outstanding dues amounting to INR 
2,97,02,324/- (Rupees Two Crores Ninety-Seven 
Lakhs Two Thousand Three Hundred and Twenty-
Four Only). It was also mentioned therein that on 

failure to discharge the payment of the said liability, 
the said property would be sealed. Because of non-
discharge of the demand as raised, the property in 
question which was now under the ownership and 
possession of Respondent No. 02 with effect from 
03.09.2015 was sealed on 21.03.2016 with prior 
indication vide affixation of public notice on the said 
property. 
Furthermore, 
a 
final 
notice 
dated 
20.02.2016 was issued by the Appellant-Corporation 
for attachment of the said property and for issuance 
of warrant of sale owing to failure of payment of the 
said outstanding arrears along with penalties and 
charges within five days from the date of such notice. 
12. It is in pursuance thereto, that the Respondent No. 
02 proceeded to deposit the outstanding dues qua the 
said property and challenged the aforesaid action of 
the Appellant-Corporation before High Court on the 
grounds as recorded above. 
13. It is evident from the aforementioned factual strata 
that the Respondent No. 02 would fall in the category 
of Section 139(1)(b)(iii) of GPMC Act 1949 being the 
owner of the said property. It is clear and undisputed 
that the Respondent No. 02 had purchased the said 

property from Respondent Nos. 04 and 05. Therefore, 
till 03.09.2015, the “person primarily liable to make 
payment” from a co-joint reading of Sections 139 and 
140 of the GPMC Act 1949 was the lessor of the said 
property, that is, Respondent Nos. 04 and 05. The 
liability prior to 03.09.2015, thus, cannot be foisted 
upon Respondent No. 02. The High Court was thus 
correct in observing that Respondent No. 02 was 
liable to pay property tax from the date of acquisition 
of ownership. Further the High Court, had been 
conscious enough while directing deduction of the 
liability of the tax from Respondent No. 02 for the 
relevant period, that is, subsequent to the date of 
purchase being 03.09.2015, prior to making refund 
of the remaining amount along with interest. It may 
be added here that this Impugned Order has been 
duly complied with by the Appellant-Corporation and 
the amount has already been refunded as evidenced 
from Communication dated 25.07.2016 and Letter 
dated 28.07.2016. 
14. Although considering the above factual matrix the 
challenge against the direction for refund in the 
Impugned Order in light of the provision of Section 

140 of the GPMC Act 1949, has become a mere 
academic exercise, yet we may proceed to look at it 
from another perspective. Here, Respondent No. 03, 
the lessee of the property, acknowledged the 
demands raised by the Appellant-Corporation for the 
period prior to 03.09.2015 and even challenged the 
same in the statutory appeals. The said challenge 
pertaining to the demands for previous three AYs, 
that is, from 2012-13 to 2014-15 were disposed of via 
an interim stay Order upon deposition of certain 
amount. It is apposite to note herein that the 
Appellant-Corporation has neither challenged the 
said stay Order dated 07.07.2016 passed in Special 
 nor has contested 
before us that the Respondent No. 02 has not filed 
statutory appeals as directed therein. So, the 
contention of the Respondent No. 02 that pending 
such 
adjudication 
of 
appeals 
the 
Appellant-
Corporation cannot challenge the correctness of 
directions of the High Court for refund of the 
amounts as deposited by Respondent No. 02 cannot 
be faulted with. 

15. Another aspect which cannot be lost sight of is that 
75% of the due amounts as per the bills raised by the 
Appellant-Corporation for the AYs 2010-11 and 
2011-12 stand deposited before Civil Court, Rajkot in 
Municipal Appeal Nos. 19 of 2010 and 1639 of 2011, 
securing a major portion of the liability subject to 
outcome of the appeals where the Appellant-
Corporation, being a party thereto and is contesting, 
cannot be permitted to take double benefit. Moreover, 
in case the said appeals get dismissed, the deposited 
amount would eventually be paid to the Appellant-
Corporation. This would result in a situation where 
the Appellant-Corporation would have a sum 
deposited in its favour equivalent to over and above 
the actual outstanding amount. Thence, to obviate 
such double payment in favour of the Appellant-
Corporation and causing disruption in the pending 
litigation against the demands accrued prior to 
03.09.2015, we are of the opinion that the order 
directing refund by the High Court stands justified 
considering the peculiarity of the aforesaid facts and 
circumstances. 

16. In light of the aforesaid discussion, we do not find any 
ground to interfere with the Impugned Order dated 
07.07.2016 passed by the High Court. The appeal is, 
therefore, dismissed. 
17. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of. 
There will be no orders as to costs.
