SLP (Crl.) No. 10570 of 2023 

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA 
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
 
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO(S). 1433 OF 2024 
[ SLP (Crl.) No(s). 10570 of 2023] 

DR. SONIA VERMA & ANR. 

VERSUS 
 
THE STATE OF HARYANA 
& ANR. 

ORDER 
1. 
Leave granted. 
2. 
The Appellants before us are aggrieved by the order dated 
19.07.2023 passed in CRM-M-34512-2023 (the ‘Impugned 
Order’) whereby the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at 
Chandigarh refused to quash FIR No. 375/2022 dated 31.10.2022 
(the ‘Subject FIR’), registered against the Appellants for 
offences under Section(s) 506, 420, 34, 120-B and 467 of the 
Indian Penal Code, 1860 (the ‘IPC’). 
 
Brief Facts: 
3. 
The uncontested facts are as follows: (i) the Appellants are 
doctors who are running the Surendra Maternity and Trauma 
Hospital (the ‘Hospital’), located in village Suthani, Tehsil 

SLP (Crl.) No. 10570 of 2023 

Bawal, Rewari, Haryana; (ii) the Appellants were paying rent to 
Respondent No. 2’s son at the rate of Rs. 25,000/- per month for 
the Hospital property until August 2022; (iii) the original owner 
of the land upon which the Hospital stands was Kaptan Singh i.e., 
husband of Respondent No. 2. 
4. 
Thereafter, as per the Appellants version, vide registered 
sale deed No. 1485 dated 23.08.2022 (the ‘RSD’), the Appellants 
purchased the land on which the Hospital stood i.e., Khewat 
No. l, Khatauni No. 1, Mustkil No. 33, Killa No. 26, village 
Suthani, Tehsil Bawal, Rewari, Haryana (the ‘Suit Property’), 
for a sale consideration of Rs. 43,00,000/-, from one Sher Singh. 
Pursuant to this purchase, the Appellants discontinued the 
payment of rent to Respondent No. 2’s son. 
5. 
Fearing dispossession from the Suit Property, the 
Appellants filed, before 
the Court of Addl. Civil Judge, Bawal, seeking a decree of 
permanent injunction against Respondent No. 2, her husband and 
one Babu Lal (the ‘Civil Suit’). In the Civil Suit, an order 
granting ad-interim injunction was passed in favour of the 
Appellants on 18.11.2022. While granting this protection, the 
Court found that the Appellants had a prima facie case as they 
had produced three registered sale deeds carrying similar 
description of the Suit Property in order to establish the chain of 
transfer leading to their ownership. As per the Appellants, the 

SLP (Crl.) No. 10570 of 2023 

Suit Property was first transferred by Kaptan Singh to Babu Lal 
vide Sale Deed dated 20.07.2020 and thereafter from Babu Lal to 
Sher Singh vide Sale Deed dated 22.08.2022. 
6. 
On 29.10.2022, FIR No. 372/2022 was registered by the 
Appellants against three persons, including Kaptan Singh and son 
of Respondent No. 2 for offences under Section(s) 506, 120-B of 
the IPC. The Appellants alleged that the accused persons had 
fraudulently collected rent from them for a prolonged period, 
despite lacking ownership over the Suit Property and were 
continuously threatening the Appellants to vacate the Suit 
Property. 
7. 
Two days later, the Subject FIR was registered against the 
Appellants and Sher Singh by Respondent No. 2, who claimed 
that she was the owner in possession of the land upon which the 
Hospital stood, citing it as Killa No. 8, instead of Killa No. 26. 
Respondent No. 2 stated that the property was transferred in her 
favour by Kaptan Singh vide Transfer Deed dated 22.08.2017 and 
that she has never alienated the property. She alleged that the 
Appellants, in collusion with Sher Singh forged the RSD and 
wrongly entered the area of the property in the RSD with the 
intention of usurping her property. 
8. 
A charge-sheet was filed in respect of the Subject FIR on 
17.03.2023 and as on date, the Appellants have been granted 
anticipatory bail by the High Court. 

SLP (Crl.) No. 10570 of 2023 

9. 
The Appellants then approached the High Court under 
Section 482 CrPC seeking quashing of the Subject FIR. Vide the 
Impugned Order, the High Court held that the allegations relate 
to Killa No. 8 in Mustkil No. 33, which the Appellants never 
claimed to have purchased. On this basis, the Court held that the 
ingredients of the offences alleged were made out against the 
Appellants and consequently, the application for quashing was 
dismissed. 
 
Contentions & Analysis: 
10. 
Learned Counsel for the Appellants forcefully contends 
that the dispute between the parties is essentially civil in nature 
and as the appropriate civil remedy is already being pursued by 
the Appellants, the criminal proceedings the 
Subject FIR amount to an abuse of the process of law. In this 
context, it is also urged that the High Court erred in failing to 
consider the litigation history between the parties i.e., the 
pending Civil Suit and the FIR filed by the Appellants against the 
family of Respondent No. 2. 
11., Learned Counsel for the State of Haryana 
submits that there exists sufficient prima facie evidence for the 
Trial Court to proceed against the Appellants and that the mere 
existence of a civil profile does not justify quashing of criminal 
proceedings. 

SLP (Crl.) No. 10570 of 2023 

12. 
It is pertinent to note that despite being served, Respondent 
No. 2 has not contested the matter before us. 
13. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and 
perused the record. 
14. 
In the considered opinion of this Court, the dispute herein, 
which forms the genesis of the criminal proceedings initiated by 
Respondent No. 2 is entirely civil in nature i.e., whether the 
Appellants are in lawful possession of the Suit Property or, in 
essence, whether the RSD is valid. To that extent, the Appellants 
have already taken recourse to the appropriate civil remedy to 
establish their claim before the Civil Court. The grievance of 
Respondent No. 2 i.e., whether the RSD is forged and fabricated 
is an issue that will be considered by the Civil Court while 
making its determination. 
15. 
A closer examination of the surrounding facts and 
circumstances fortifies the conclusion that an attempt has been 
made by the Respondent No. 2 to shroud a civil dispute with a 
cloak of criminality. The following aspects of the case are 
pertinent to note: (i) Respondent No. 2 registered the Subject FIR 
subsequent to the filing of the by the Appellants; (ii) the chain of sale deeds produced 
by the Appellants contain identical descriptions of the Suit 
Property and yet Respondent No. 2 has pursued criminal action 
only against the Appellants and Sher Singh and not against 

SLP (Crl.) No. 10570 of 2023 

Babu Lal and her husband; (iii) Respondent No. 2 has failed to 
contest the present matter before this Court; (iv) the admitted 
position that the Appellants were bonafide in their payment of 
rent before their alleged purchase of the Suit Property. 
16. 
This Court in Paramjeet Batra v. State of Uttarakhand & 
Ors.1 has expounded on the scope of exercise of power under 
Section 482 CrPC whilst dealing with similar matters: 
 
“7. While exercising its jurisdiction under Section 
482 of the Code the High Court has to be cautious. 
This power is to be used sparingly and only for the 
purpose of preventing abuse of the process of any 
court or otherwise to secure ends of justice. 
Whether a complaint discloses a criminal offence or 
not depends upon the nature of facts alleged therein. 
Whether essential ingredients of criminal offence 
are present or not has to be judged by the High 
Court. A complaint disclosing civil transactions 
may also have a criminal texture. But the High 
Court must see whether a dispute which is 
essentially of a civil nature is given a cloak of 
criminal offence. In such a situation, if a civil 
remedy is available and is, in fact, adopted as has 
happened in this case, the High Court should not 
hesitate to quash criminal proceedings to prevent 
abuse of process of court.” 
 
17. 
Therefore, when the High Court was apprised of such a 
matter wherein the substance of the criminal complaint served 
only to cast doubt on the validity of a commercial transaction 

SLP (Crl.) No. 10570 of 2023 

(in this case, a sale deed for the transfer of property), and the 
appropriate civil remedy was already being pursued, the High 
Court ought to have quashed the criminal proceedings. 
18. 
For the reasons stated above, the Impugned Order is set 
aside and the entire criminal proceedings the 
Subject FIR are quashed and set aside. Needless to say, this order 
shall not have any effect on the Civil Suit pending between the 
parties and the same shall be decided in accordance with law. 
19. 
Resultantly, the appeal stands allowed. 
20. 
Pending applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of.
