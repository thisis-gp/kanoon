W.P.(C) No. 768 OF 2013 

ORDER 

To avoid prolixity and repetition, we refrain from restating 
the facts and developments in the present writ petitions, as they 
have already been delineated in our prior order dated 14.03.2024. 
We address and answer the applications listed before us in the 
manner provided below. 
 
I.A. No. 232/2014 
 
To await report(s) of the Central Empowered Committee1 and the 
Monitoring Committee, and reply/response thereto, re-list in the 
week commencing 20.08.2024. 

1 For short, “CEC”. 

I.A. No. 237/2015 
 
It is stated by the learned counsel appearing for the 
applicant(s) that the present application has become infructuous. 
Accordingly, the application is dismissed as infructuous. 
 
I.A. No. 238/2015 
 
The 
present 
application 
has 
become 
infructuous 
and 
is 
accordingly dismissed as infructuous. 
 
I.A. No. 239/2015 and 240/2015 
 
None appears on behalf of the applicant(s). 
 
Mr. Shyam Divan, learned Amicus Curiae has pointed out that 
the issue raised in the present applications is covered by the 
decision of this Court, dated 30.07.2015 in “Samaj Partivartana 
Samudaya and Ors. v. State of Karnataka and Ors.”2. 
 
It appears that the applications may have become infructuous. 
 
Accordingly, the applications are dismissed in default. 

I.A. No.241/2015 
 
According to the applicant’s declarations before the Indian 
Bureau of Mines3, they had extracted 9,23,582 Metric Tonnes4 of iron 
ore in the period commencing 01.04.2011 till the suspension of 
mining leases vide this Court’s order(s). However, the Monitoring 
Committee had sold 10,67,813 MT of iron ore. Therefore, the total 
excess iron ore sold by the Monitoring Committee stood at 1,44,231 
 
2(2017). 
3 For short, “IBM”. 
4 For short, “MT”. 

MT. 
The excess iron ore sold totaling to 1,44,231 MT includes 
39,725 MT of iron ore which was found lying on the railway sidings. 
If we exclude 39,725 MT of iron ore from the total quantum of 
excess iron ore sold, that is, 1,44,231 MT, we arrive at a balance 
of 1,04,506 MT of iron ore. 
It is the contention of the applicant(s) that they had filed 
revised return(s) to the IBM on 26.10.2011. We are not inclined to 
accept the said submission for several reasons including the fact 
that the revised return(s) was submitted post the order(s) of this 
Court suspending the mining activities. The revised return(s) 
itself indicates wrong-doing or, at least discrepancies. Finally, 
no provision or rule permits the revision of returns. 
 
In view of the aforesaid, we do not think that the 
applicant(s) is entitled to payment viz. 1,04,506 MT of excess iron 
ore sold by the Monitoring Committee. 
 
For the 39,725 MT of iron ore found lying at the railway 
sidings, the CEC report states that the applicant(s) was required 
to establish that the said quantity had been legally extracted and 
transported to the railway sidings. The applicant must establish 
that 39,725 MT of the iron ore was declared in the return(s) filed 
by them with the IBM. 
 
It will be open to the applicant(s) to file the papers and 
documents before the CEC, which will thereupon, in consultation 
with the Monitoring Committee pass appropriate order(s). However, 
any order passed for payment, will not be implemented without the 
permission of the Court. 

Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the applicant(s) states 
that in view of the order passed today, nothing survives in Writ 
Petition No. 35626/2024, which is pending before the High Court of 
Karnataka, and the same shall be withdrawn. The statement is taken 
on record. 
 
The application is disposed of accordingly. 
 
I.A. No. 245/2015 
 
None is present on behalf of the applicant(s). 
It appears that the present application may have become

I.A. No. 251/2016 
 
None is present to press the present application. 
It appears that the present application may have become 
infructuous in view of the subsequent developments. 
 
Accordingly, the application is dismissed in default. 
 
I.A. No.253/2016 
 
The present application is filed by the State of Karnataka. 

Most of the prayers have already become infructuous in view of the 
subsequent development and the orders passed by this Court. In our 
order dated 14.03.2024, directions have also been issued viz. the 
unauctioned 
Category 
C 
mines, 
where 
the 
Reclamation 
and 
Rehabilitation Plans5 work is yet to be undertaken. 
 
In case the State of Karnataka wants to merge some of the 
Category C mines for the purposes of auction, they can prepare a 
justification report and file an application for appropriate order 
before this Court. 
In view of and recording the aforesaid, we dispose of the 
present application in terms of the earlier order(s) passed by this 
Court with liberty to the State of Karnataka to file a fresh 
application, if required and necessary.

Development Corporation Limited6. 
 
It appears that the present application may have become 
infructuous in view of the subsequent development/orders. 
 
Accordingly, the application is dismissed in default. 
 
I.A. No. 265/2016 
 
In view of the CEC’s report, we accept the proposal given by 
the Secretary, Mining and the Government of Karnataka. Accordingly, 
1.28 hectares, which is the forest land will be excluded from the 
10.87 hectares to be added. Therefore, 9.59 hectares of additional 
land may be added to the free leased land of 9.15 hectares, in the 
Mining Lease No. 2525. Thus, the total area of the Mining Lease No. 
2525 will be enhanced to 18.74 hectares. 

We also permit the State of Karnataka to auction the said 
mining lease in terms of the directions given by this Court. The 
new lessee will have to undertake the R&R Plans. 
 
6 For short, “NMDC”. 

The application is disposed of in the above terms.

Accordingly, the application is dismissed in default. 
 
I.A. Nos.62856/2018, 57649/2020 and 57650/2020 
 
These applications are for a refund of the guarantee money 
furnished by the lessees. 
The guarantee money was directed to be deposited in terms of 
the order dated 28.09.2012, which order also states that the 
guarantee money will be refunded upon the implementation of the R&R 
Plans to the complete satisfaction of the CEC and subject to the 
approval of this Court. 
 
Thereafter, the order dated 25.04.2017 in I.A. No.267/2016 
directs refund of 90% of the guarantee money on the Monitoring 

Committee’s satisfaction viz. the implementation of R&R Plans in 
the case of Category B mining leases. The balance 10% is to be 
released to the applicant(s) after full implementation of R&R 
Plans. 
 
Our attention is drawn to the CEC report dated 07.07.2017, 
which states that in 44 Category B mining leases, the progress in 
implementation of the R&R Plans is above 85%. Subsequently, report 
of CEC dated 28.08.2018 seeks certain directions from this Court to 
the Monitoring Committee. 
 
Lastly, our attention is drawn to this Court’s order dated 
30.08.2018, directing the Monitoring Committee to complete the 
inspection of remaining leases (10 in number) on or before 
15.09.2018, besides the release of guarantee money to lessees where 
the implementation of R&R Plans is complete. The question of review 
in 16 cases where a part of the guarantee money had been released 
was left open. 
 
Learned Amicus Curiae appearing in the matter states that in 
26 cases, guarantee money has been released. In 12 cases, the 
matter requires examination. In six cases, no guarantee money was 
submitted. 
 
The Monitoring Committee and the CEC will submit a status 
report within a period of seven weeks from today with regard to the 
implementation and execution of the R&R Plans. In case the 
Monitoring Committee and the CEC are ad-idem that R&R work is 
complete, the guarantee money can be refunded to the Category B 
mining lease holders. If the R&R Plans have not been fully 
implemented, a copy of the report will be furnished to such mining 

lease holders, who shall thereupon submit their reply to the 
Monitoring Committee and CEC. 
 
Liberty is granted to the parties, as well as the CEC and 
Monitoring Committee, to approach this Court by way of an 
appropriate application in case they have any grievances. 
Recording the aforesaid, the applications are disposed of. 
I.A. No. 76075/2018 
 
At the request of learned counsel for the applicant(s), the 
present application is not taken up for hearing today. 
 
It will be open to the applicant(s) to file additional 
documents. 
 
We note the objection raised by the Amicus Curiae, that the 
prayer(s) made in the present application had already been rejected 
while deciding I.A. No. 141339/2017 on 21.03.2018. The Amicus 
Curiae, therefore, submits that the present application is not 
maintainable. 
 
Learned counsel for the applicant(s) will examine the said 
aspect. 
 
I.A. Nos. 113399/2018, 108707/2018 and 108710/2018 
 
In view of the order dated 14.03.2024, the applications would

Accordingly, the applications are dismissed in default. 
 
I.A. No. 13037/2019 in I.A. No. 37377/2018 

This is an application seeking permission to file additional 
documents in I.A. No. 37377/2018.

which issue, it is stated, has been raised in a separate 
application.

as withdrawn. 
 
I.A. Nos. 143275/2019, 143282/2019 and 143284/2019 
 
We reject the prayer for a change of categorization. The 
categorization was undertaken after a detailed consideration in 
2012-2014. These applications are filed later in 2019. 
 
The orders passed by this Court in 2013-2014 were in the 
public domain and known to parties. 
 
In view of the delay and lapses, we are not inclined to re-
examine the facts. The prayer(s) made is rejected. 
 
The applicant(s) also states that in terms of the grant of 
renewal of the mining lease vide Government of Karnataka’s order 
dated 21.03.2012, the applicant(s) was only entitled to mine 

manganese ore and not iron ore. This issue is not directly related 
to the present litigation. 
 
In case the applicant(s) has any grievance, he can raise the 
same before the appropriate forum, in accordance with law. We make 
no comments either way on merits in this regard. 
 
The applications are disposed of in the above terms.

This application has to be rejected in view of the reasons 
given while dismissing I.A. No. 119035/2019. The application is 
accordingly dismissed. 
 
The undertaking given by the State of Karnataka will be 
treated as non-effective. 
 
Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the applicant(s) states 
that the issue with regard to the excavated ore has not been raised 
in the application. We make no comments in this regard. 
 
The dismissal of the present application will not operate as 
res judicata on issues not raised in the present application.

We wish to clarify that if a party has any grievance or issue 
with the action, in-action or report of the CEC, the Monitoring 

Committee or the Oversight Authority in respect of the mining 
leases in the three districts, namely, Bellary, Chitradurga and 
Tumkur in Karnataka, they should approach this Court by filing an 
application. Normally, the High Court should not entertain an 
application/issue/dispute, as the matter is sub-judice and this 
Court is in seisin. Albeit, this Court can direct the parties to 
approach the High Court, if required and necessary.
