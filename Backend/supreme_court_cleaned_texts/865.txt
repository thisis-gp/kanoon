ORDER 
 
Writ Petition (C) No 645 of 2020 and Writ Petition (C) No 1467 of 2020 

These writ petitions seek to challenge the insertion of the words 
‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ in the Preamble to the Constitution of India by the 
Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act in 1976. The challenge is on 
various grounds, namely, retrospectivity of the insertion in 1976, resulting 
in falsity as the Constitution was adopted on the 26th day of November 
1949; the word ‘secular’ was deliberately eschewed by the Constituent 
Assembly, and the word ‘socialist’ fetters and restricts the economic policy 
choice vesting in the elected government, which represents the will of the 
people. Besides, it is submitted that the Forty-second Amendment is 

W.P. ( & others 

vitiated and unconstitutional as it was ‘passed’ during the Emergency on 
November 2, 1976, after the normal tenure of the Lok Sabha that had 
ended on March 18, 1976. Therefore, it is argued, that there was no will of 
the people to sanction the amendments. 

The writ petitions do not require detailed adjudication as the flaws and 
weaknesses in the arguments are obvious and manifest. Two 
expressions—'secular' and 'socialist' and the word 'integrity' were inserted 
in the Preamble vide the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 
1976. These amendments were made in 1976. Article 368 of the 
Constitution permits amendment of the Constitution. The power to amend 
unquestionably rests with the Parliament. This amending power extends to 
the Preamble. Amendments to the Constitution can be challenged on 
various grounds, including violation of the basic structure of the 
Constitution. The fact that the Constitution was adopted, enacted, and 
given to themselves by the people of India on the 26th day of November, 
1949, does not make any difference. The date of adoption will not curtail 
or restrict the power under Article 368 of the Constitution. The 
retrospectivity argument, if accepted, would equally apply to amendments 
made to any part of the Constitution, though the power of the Parliament 
to do so under Article 368, is incontrovertible and is not challenged. 

While it is true that the Constituent Assembly had not agreed to include 
the words 'socialist' and 'secular' in the Preamble, the Constitution is a 
living document, as noticed above with power given to the Parliament to 
amend it in terms of and in accord with Article 368. In 1949, the term 

W.P. ( & others 

'secular' was considered imprecise, as some scholars and jurists had 
interpreted it as being opposed to religion. Over time, India has developed 
its own interpretation of secularism, wherein the State neither supports 
any religion nor penalizes the profession and practice of any faith. This 
principle is enshrined in Articles 14, 15, and 16 of the Constitution, which 
prohibit discrimination against citizens on religious grounds while 
guaranteeing equal protection of laws and equal opportunity in public 
employment. The Preamble's original tenets—equality of status and 
opportunity; fraternity, ensuring individual dignity—read alongside justice - 
social, economic political, and liberty; of thought, expression, belief, faith, 
and worship, reflect this secular ethos. Article 25 guarantees all persons 
equal freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice, and 
propagate religion, subject to public order, morality, health, other 
fundamental rights, and the State's power to regulate secular activities 
associated with religious practices. Article 26 extends to every religious 
denomination the right to establish and maintain religious and charitable 
institutions, manage religious affairs, own and acquire property, and 
administer such property in accordance with law. Furthermore, Article 29 
safeguards the distinct culture of every section of citizens, while Article 30 
grants religious and linguistic minorities the right to establish and 
administer their own educational institutions. Despite these provisions, 
Article 44 in the Directive Principles of State Policy permits the State to 
strive for a uniform civil code for its citizens. 

W.P. ( & others 

A number of decisions of this Court, including the Constitution Bench 
judgments in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala1 and S R Bommai 
vs Union of India2, have observed that secularism is a basic feature of 
the Constitution. In R C Poudyal v. Union of India3, the Court elucidated 
that although the term 'secular' was not present in the Constitution before 
its insertion in the Preamble by the Constitution (Forty-second 
Amendment) Act, 1976, secularism essentially represents the nation's 
commitment to treat persons of all faiths equally and without 
discrimination. In M Ismail Faruqui (Dr) v. Union of India4, this Court 
elaborated that the expression secularism in the Indian context is a term of 
the widest possible scope. The State maintains no religion of its own, all 
persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience along with the right 
to freely profess, practice, and propagate their chosen religion, and all 
citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs, enjoy equal freedoms and 
rights. However, the ‘secular’ nature of the State does not prevent the 
elimination of attitudes and practices derived from or connected with 
religion, when they, in the larger public interest impede development and 
the right to equality. In essence, the concept of secularism represents one 
of the facets of the right to equality, intricately woven into the basic fabric 
that depicts the constitutional scheme's pattern. 

Similarly, the word 'socialism', in the Indian context should not be 
interpreted as restricting the economic policies of an elected government 

(1973) (13 Judges) 

(1994) (9 Judges) 

(1994) Supp (1) SCC 324 

W.P. ( & others 

of the people's choice at a given time. Neither the Constitution nor the 
Preamble mandates a specific economic policy or structure, whether left 
or right. Rather, 'socialist' denotes the State's commitment to be a welfare 
State and its commitment to ensuring equality of opportunity. India has 
consistently embraced a mixed economy model, where the private sector 
has flourished, expanded, and grown over the years, contributing 
significantly to the upliftment of marginalized and underprivileged sections 
in different ways. In the Indian framework, socialism embodies the 
principle of economic and social justice, wherein the State ensures that no 
citizen is disadvantaged due to economic or social circumstances. The 
word ‘socialism’ reflects the goal of economic and social upliftment and 
does not restrict private entrepreneurship and the right to business and 
trade, a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g). 

The argument that the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, 
should be struck down due to its enactment during the Emergency and the 
extended period of the Lok Sabha was previously deliberated in 
Parliament, during the consideration of the Constitution Forty-Fifth 
Amendment Bill, 1978. During these deliberations, the inclusion of the 
words 'secular' and 'socialist' came under scrutiny. Subsequently, this Bill 
was renumbered and called the Constitution Forty-Fourth Amendment Act 
1978. The word 'secular' was explained as denoting a republic that 
upholds equal respect for all religions, while 'socialist' was characterized 
as representing a republic dedicated to eliminating all forms of 
exploitation—whether social, political, or economic. However, the said 

W.P. ( & others 

amendment as proposed to Article 366 was not accepted by the Council of 
States. No doubt, in Excel Wear v. Union of India and Others5, this 
Court had held that the addition of the word socialist in the Preamble may 
enable the Court to lean more in favour of nationalization and State 
ownership of industries, yet this Court recognized private ownership of 
industries, which forms a large portion of the economic structure. The 
majority judgment of this Court in the 9-Judge Constitution Bench in 
Property Owners Association and Others v. State of Maharashtra and 
Others6 has cleared any doubt and ambiguity, as it is held that the 
Constitution, as framed in broad terms, allows the elected government to 
adopt a structure for economic governance which would sub-serve the 
policies for which it is accountable to the electorate. Indian economy has 
transitioned from the dominance of public investment to the co-existence 
of public and private investment. 

The fact that the writ petitions were filed in 2020, forty-four years after the 
words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ became integral to the Preamble, makes the 
prayers particularly questionable. This stems from the fact that these 
terms have achieved widespread acceptance, with their meanings 
understood by “We, the people of India” without any semblance of doubt. 
The additions to the Preamble have not restricted or impeded legislations 
or policies pursued by elected governments, provided such actions did not 
infringe upon fundamental and constitutional rights or the basic structure 
of the Constitution. Therefore, we do not find any legitimate cause or 

W.P. ( & others 

justification for challenging this constitutional amendment after nearly 44 
years. The circumstances do not warrant this Court’s exercise of discretion 
to undertake an exhaustive examination, as the constitutional position 
remains unambiguous, negating the need for a detailed academic 
pronouncement. This being the clear position, we do not find any 
justification or need to issue notice in the present writ petitions, and the 
same are accordingly dismissed. 

Pending applications, including the applications for intervention, shall also 
stand dismissed.
