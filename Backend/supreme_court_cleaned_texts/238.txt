ORDER
 
1.
This order records reasons and decides the applications for
stay of selection and appointment of the Election
Commissioners1, in the writ petitions filed under Article 32
of the Constitution of India2, inter alia, challenging the
vires of Section 7(1) of the Chief Election Commissioner and
other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of
Service, and Term of Office) Act, 2023.3
1 For short, “EC”.
2 For short, “Constitution”.
3 For short, “2023 Act”.

2.
The primary grounds of challenge are twofold. First, Section
7(1) of the 2023 Act dilutes, if not amends or modifies, the
judgment of this Court’s Constitution Bench in Anoop Baranwal
v. Union of India4, by substituting the Chief Justice of India5
with a Union Cabinet Minister nominated by the Prime Minister
in the Selection Committee for the post of the Chief Election
Commissioner6 and the ECs. Secondly, the provision has a
direct and potential impact on the conduct of transparent,
free and fair elections, one of the foundational requirements
of democracy.
3.
That apart, the selection process of the ECs, as adopted in
the present case, has been challenged on the ground of
procedural irregularity, affecting the fairness, transparency
and objectivity in the selection process in question. The
Leader of Opposition in the House of the People7 was not
furnished necessary details of the six shortlisted candidates
in advance to effectively participate in the selection
process8. The names and details were statedly furnished
minutes before the meeting for the selection of the ECs was
held on 14.03.20249. Thus, he has been denied the opportunity
4 (2023).
5 For short, “CJI”.
6 For short, “CEC”.
7 For short, “LoP”. As per Explanation to Section 7(1) of the 2023 Act the leader
of the single largest party in opposition of the Government in the House of the
People shall be deemed to be the LoP, in case where the LoP has not been
recognized.
8 Reliance is placed on the letter dated 12.03.2024 of Mr. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury
requesting for bio-profiles of the persons short-listed by the Search Committee
well before the meeting of the Selection Committee.
9 Reliance is placed on the report dated 14.03.2024 published in the Indian
Express quoting Mr Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. to choose and have his voice heard. Further, the writ petition
challenging the vires of the 2023 Act was sub-judice before
this Court since 02.01.2024, and therefore soon after the
resignation of one of the ECs, applications for stay were
filed, mentioned and directed to be listed for hearing before
this Court on 15.03.2024. However, the selection and
appointment of two ECs was made on 14.03.2024.10
4.
The Union of India has filed a conjoint reply to the
applications for stay inter alia, stating that: - 
a) The 2023 Act has been enacted as contemplated by Article
324(2) of the Constitution and was brought into effect on
02.01.2024. b) On 01.02.2024, the Selection Committee, under Section
7(1) of the 2023 Act, was constituted, and consists of
the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and the LoP. c) On 01.02.2024, the Search Committee, under Section 6 of
the 2023 Act, was constituted, and is chaired by Minister
of State, Law and Justice, Government of India11 with the
Home Secretary, GoI and Secretary, Department of
Personnel and Training, GoI as members. d) On 04.02.2024, notice was issued for convening meeting of
10 An earlier vacancy to the post of EC was created by virtue of EC – Mr. Anup
Chandra Pandey demitting office on 14.02.2024. The second vacancy to the post of
EC occured by virtue of the resignation of EC – Mr. Arun Goel on 09.03.2024.
11 For short, “GoI”. the Selection Committee on 07.02.2024 for filling one
vacancy to the post of EC, as an EC had demitted office.12
However, the meeting was postponed on 07.02.2024. e) On 09.03.2024, notice was issued for meeting of the
Selection Committee to be held on 15.03.2024. f)
On 09.03.2024, Mr. Arun Goel, EC, tendered his
resignation, which was accepted w.e.f. 09.03.2024,
thereby resulting in the second vacancy. g) In view of the second vacancy, a revised note dated
09.03.2024 was issued for the meeting of the Selection
Committee to be held on 14.03.2024 for filling up the two
vacant posts of EC.
It is highlighted by the respondent – Union of India that
the meeting fixed for 15.03.2024 was preponed to 14.03.2024 on
09.03.2024, prior to the listing of the stay applications by
this Court on 15.03.2024. 
5.
However, it is to be noted that I.A. No. 63879/2024 in Writ
Petition (C) No. 87 of 2024 was filed on 12.03.202413 and I.A.
No. 66382/2024 in W.P. (C) 11/2024 was filed on 14.03.202414. 
12 See supra note 10.
13 Application filed by Association of Democratic Reforms praying, inter alia,
for the stay of implementation of Section 7 of the 2023 Act.
14 Application filed by Naman Sherstra praying, inter alia, for stay of the
effect of the 2023 Act. Earlier I.A. No. 4223/2024 in W.P. (C) 13/2024 was filed
on 05.01.2024, I.A. No. 30286/2024 in W.P. (C) No. 87 of 2024 was filed on
05.02.2024, albeit stay was not granted by this court. 

6.
Mr. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Member of the Selection
Committee15, on 12.03.2024 had requested the Secretary,
Legislative Department, GoI to share details of the
shortlisted names. On 13.03.2024, the Secretary, Legislative
Department, GoI, had sent a list of eligible persons, more
than 200 in number, being considered by the Search Committee
to Mr. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. The Search Committee had not
carried out the shortlisting exercise by then.
7.
The Search Committee, in its meeting on 13.03.2024, could not
finalise and shortlist the names. In the meeting held on
14.03.2024, the Search Committee recommended a panel of six
names for consideration of the Selection Committee, which were
then circulated and forwarded to the members of the Selection
Committee, including Mr. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.
8.
On 14.03.2024 the Selection Committee met and recommended the
names of Mr. Gyanesh Kumar and Dr. Sukhbir Singh Sandhu to the
President of India for appointment as ECs. The President of
India had thereupon approved the recommendation on 14.03.2024.
9.
We would not, at this stage, go into the depth and details of
the challenge to the vires of Section 7(1) of the 2023 Act.
The judgment in
 Anoop Baranwal 
(supra) notices the
appointments of the CEC and ECs made from the 1950s till
2023,16 but this Court intervened in the absence of any
15 Being the leader of the single largest party in opposition in the House of the
People.
16 See paragraphs 63-72, Anoop Baranwal (supra). legislation. Article 324(2) postulates the appointment of the
CEC and ECs by the President of India in the absence of any
law made by the Parliament. The judgment in Anoop Baranwal
(supra) records that there was a legislative vacuum as the
Parliament had not made any enactment as contemplated in
Article 324(2). Given the unique nature of the provision and
absence of an enactment, this Court had issued directions
constituting the Selection Committee as a pro-tem measure.
This is clear from the judgment, which states that the
direction shall hold good till a law is made by the
Parliament. It is also observed that the Court is neither
invited, nor if invited, would issue a mandamus to the
legislature to make a law. We would also add that the Court
would not ‘invite’ the legislature to make a law in a
particular manner. However, the Constitutional Court within
the framework of the Constitution exercises the power of
judicial review and can invalidate a law when it is violative
of the Fundamental Rights, on application of the principle of
proportionality, etc.
 
10.
It is well-settled position of law that in matters involving
constitutionality of legislations, courts are cautious and
show judicial restraint in granting interim orders. Unless the
provision is ex facie unconstitutional or manifestly violates
fundamental rights, the statutory provision cannot be
stultified by granting an interim order.17 Stay is not ipso
17 Health for Millions v. Union of India, (2014). facto granted for mere examination or even when some cogent
contention is raised. Suspension of legislation pending
consideration is an exception and not the rule. The said
principle keeps in mind the presumption regarding
constitutionality of legislation as well as the fact that the
constitutional challenge when made may or may not result in
success. The courts do not, unless eminently necessary to deal
with the crises situation and quell disquiet, keep the
statutory provision in abeyance or direct that the same be not
made operational. However, it would not be appropriate to pen
down all situations as sometimes even gross or egregious
violation of individual Fundamental Rights may on balance of
convenience warrant an interim order. The Courts strike a
delicate balance to step-in in rare and exceptional cases,
being mindful of the immediate need, and the consequences as
to not cause confusion and disarray. 
11.
The applicant-petitioners urge that this court may by an
interim order direct fresh selection with the CJI as a member
of the Selection Committee. This would be plainly
impermissible,
 
without
 
declaring
 
Section
 
7(1)
 
as
unconstitutional. Further, we would be enacting or writing a
new law replacing or modifying Section 7(1) of the Act, as
enacted by the Parliament, if such a contention were accepted.
12.
Moreover, any interjection or stay by this Court will be
highly inappropriate and improper as it would disturb the 18th

General Election for the Lok Sabha which has been scheduled
and is now fixed to take place from 19.04.2024 till
01.06.2024. Balance of convenience, apart from prima facie
case and irreparable injury, is one of the considerations
which the court must keep in mind while considering any
application for grant of stay or injunction. Interlocutory
remedy is normally intended to preserve status quo unless
there are exceptional circumstances which tilt the scales and
balance of convenience on account of any resultant injury. In
our opinion, grant of stay would lead to uncertainty and
confusion, if not chaos. That apart, even when the matter had
come up earlier and the applications for stay were pressed, we
had refused to grant stay. 
13.
Given the importance and humongous task undertaken by the
Election Commission of India, presence of two more ECs brings
about a balance and check. The concept of plurality in Article
324 of the Constitution, which has been noticed and approved
by this Court in T.N. Seshan v. Union of India18, is necessary
and desirable.
14.
We must, however express our concern on the procedure adopted
for selection of the incumbents to the two vacant posts of
ECs, a significant constitutional post. Such selections should
be made with full details and particulars of the candidates
being circulated to all members of the Selection Committee.
18 (1995).

Section 6 of the 2023 Act postulates five prospective
candidates which, prima facie, appears to mean that for two
vacant posts ten prospective candidates should have been
shortlisted. Procedural sanctity of the selection process
requires fair deliberation with examination of background and
merits of the candidate. The sanctity of the process should
not be affected.
 Nevertheless, in spite of the said
shortcoming, we do not deem it appropriate at this stage,
keeping in view the timelines for the upcoming 18th General
Elections for the Lok Sabha, to pass any interim order or
direction. As indicated above, this would lead to chaos and
virtual constitutional breakdown. Remand at this stage would
not resolve the matter. It may also be relevant to state that
the petitioners have not commented or questioned the merits of
the persons selected/appointed as Ecs.
15.
Further, EC being a constitutional post, it is wise to remind
ourselves that once a constitutional post holder is selected,
they are duty bound to act in accordance with the letter and
spirit of the Constitution. The assumption is that they shall
adhere to constitutional role and propriety in their
functioning. To borrow from Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Chairman,
Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly of India:
“However good a Constitution may be, if those who
are implementing it are not good, it will prove
to be bad. However bad a Constitution may be, if
those implementing it are good, it will prove to
be good.”

16.
Having regard to the aforesaid position, we are not inclined
to accept the prayer for grant of stay. Accordingly, the
applications seeking stay are dismissed. We would clarify that
the observations in this order are tentative and are not to be
treated as final and binding, as the matter is sub-judice.
