2. 
These appeals are at the instance of the wife and sons1 of the deceased 
Silak Ram, who was on 4th August, 2015, travelling on a motorcycle bearing 
 
1 Hereinafter “claimant-appellants” 

2| SLP(C) Nos.23939-40 of 2023 
 
registration No.HR-12X-2820, along with one Rohit. Both were found lying 
injured on the side of the road. The former had succumbed to his injuries and 
the latter was taken for treatment to Medical College, Rohtak. 
3. 
One Krishan who had discovered the deceased and the injured person on 
the road, reported the matter to the police and, during the investigation of such 
incident, the statement of the injured Rohit revealed the particulars of the 
offending vehicles. In connection thereto, F.I.R.No.481/2015 dated 4th August, 
2015 under Sections 279/337, 304A was registered at Police Station, Sampla. 
4. 
The claim petition, bearing No.25 of 2015 was instituted by the family 
members of the deceased on 16th December, 2015 before the Motor Accident 
Claims Tribunal, Rohtak2. Vide Award dated 26th April, 2017 an amount of 
Rs.19,35,400/- was passed with an interest @7.5% from the date of filing of the 
claim petition. The respondent-insurance company was directed to deposit the 
money into the bank accounts of the claimant-appellants. However, for claimant 
Nos.2 and 3, who were minors at the relevant time, their share of Rs.6 lakhs each 
was directed to be placed in fixed deposit till the age of majority or for a period 
of five years, whichever is later. 
5. 
On appeal to the High Court, vide judgment and order dated 9th March, 
2023 passed in FAO Nos.8504 of 2017 (O&M) and 6836 of 2017 (O&M) the 
amount awarded by the MACT was reduced to Rs.9,22,336/- noting that 
 
2 Hereinafter “MACT” 

3| SLP(C) Nos.23939-40 of 2023 
 
minimum wage rates issued by the Government are uniformly applicable 
throughout the State and, therefore, constitute a better measure for calculating 
the notional income of a deceased person, as opposed to special DC rates 
notified by the Deputy Commissioner of a District, and, therefore, would only 
be applicable to that particular district. Further, it was observed that with respect 
to the age at the time of death, the Aadhar Card of the deceased records his date 
of birth to be 1st January 1969; thus, the age comes to 47 years. Hence, the 
multiplier applicable would be 13. 
6. 
The claimant-appellants, aggrieved by the reduction, have approached 
this Court. Before us, it was contended that the multiplier applicable would be 
14 since, in the School Leave Certificate the date of birth of the deceased is 
shown as 7th October, 1970. His age, then at the time of the accident was 45 
years. They were further aggrieved by the calculation of monthly income to be 
Rs.5,886/-. 
7. 
Notice was issued on 17th October, 2023. The matter was then sent to Lok 
Adalat by way of an order dated 23rd July 2024. A subsequent order dated 2nd 
August 2024 records that the matter could not be settled. 
8. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also perused the 
record. The questions arising for consideration are - (a) in case of conflict of 
the dates of birth between the two documents, as in this case between the School 
Leaving Certificate and the Aadhar Card, which of the two is to be taken as 

4| SLP(C) Nos.23939-40 of 2023 
 
authoritative; and (b) whether in the facts of the case, the High Court’s reduction 
of the compensation awarded by the learned MACT, was justified and in 
accordance with law? 
9. 
This Court is of the view that the High Court erred in undertaking the 
reduction as it has. The reasons therefor are recorded in the following 
paragraphs. 
9.1 The general rule insofar as appellate proceedings are concerned is 
that a Court sitting in appeal is not to substitute its view for that of the 
Court below. It is only to see that the decision arrived at is not afflicted 
by perversity, illegality or any other such vice which may compromise it 
beyond redemption. 
9.2 It is also well settled that an order is not to be interfered with simply 
because another view is possible, which, in the impugned order the High 
Court seems to have done. 
9.3 The question before the High Court was not as to which yardstick 
to use to determine the notional income of the deceased was ‘better’. 
Since there is nothing on record to establish that the rates notified by the 
District Commissioner, Rohtak, would not apply to the deceased, we find 
no reason to interfere with the finding of the Tribunal. Further, the 
testimonies of PWs 2, 5 and 6 show that he is an agriculturist who owned 
his own tractor and a JCB machine. 

5| SLP(C) Nos.23939-40 of 2023 
 
9.4 The second aspect is the age of the deceased. The High Court, relied 
on the age as mentioned in the Aadhar Card of the deceased, i.e., 1st 
January, 1969. However, as submitted by the claimant-appellants, the 
School Leaving Certificate records the date of birth of the deceased to 
be 7th October, 1970. This will affect the multiplier to be applied. Let us 
now consider this question. 
It has to be noted at the outset that a School Leaving Certificate 
has been accorded statutory recognition. Sub-section (2) of Section 94 
of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 20153 
reads thus: 
“(2) In case, the Committee or the Board has reasonable grounds for 
doubt regarding whether the person brought before it is a child or 
not, the Committee or the Board, as the case may be, shall undertake 
the process of age determination, by seeking evidence by obtaining 
— 

the date of birth certificate from the school, or the matriculation or 
equivalent certificate from the concerned examination Board, if 
available; and in the absence thereof; 

the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority 
or a panchayat; 

and only in the absence of (i) and (ii) above, age shall be determined 
by an ossification test or any other latest medical age determination 
test conducted on the orders of the Committee or the Board…”

6| SLP(C) Nos.23939-40 of 2023 

Whether the Aadhar Card is sufficient proof of a person’s age, has 
come up for consideration before some High Courts, albeit in the context 
of different statutes. We shall refer to a few instances but, prior to doing 
so, it is also important to take note of the purpose behind introduction of 
the Aadhar Scheme. In the Constitution Bench judgment in K.S. 
Puttaswamy v. Union of India (5-J.)4 Dr. A.K. Sikri, J. wrote as 
hereinbelow extracted, encapsulating the object and purpose of Aadhar:- 
“24. Before adverting to the discussion on various issues that have 
been raised in these petitions, it would be apposite to first understand 
the structure of the Aadhaar Act and how it operates, having regard 
to various provisions contained therein. UIDAI was established in 
the year 2009 by an administrative order i.e. by resolution of the 
Govt. of India, Planning Commission, vide notification dated 
January 28, 2009. The object of the establishment of the said 
Authority was primarily to lay down policies to implement the 
Unique Identification Scheme (for short the ‘UIS’) of the 
Government, by which residents of India were to be provided unique 
identity number. The aim was to serve this as proof of identity, 
which is unique in nature, as each individual will have only one 
identity with no chance of duplication. Another objective was that 
this number could be used for identification of beneficiaries for 
transfer of benefits, subsidies, services and other purposes. This was 
the primary reason, viz. to ensure correct identification of targeted 
beneficiaries for delivery of various subsidies, benefits, services, 
grants, wages and other social benefits schemes which are funded 
from the Consolidated Fund of India... 
 
Summing up the Scheme: 
62. The whole architecture of Aadhaar is devised to give unique 
identity to the citizens of this country. No doubt, a person can have 
various documents on the basis of which that individual can establish 
her identity. It may be in the form of a passport, Permanent Account 
Number (PAN) card, ration card and so on. For the purpose of 
enrolment itself number of documents are prescribed which an 
individual can produce on the basis of which Aadhaar card can be 
 
4 (2019) 

7| SLP(C) Nos.23939-40 of 2023 
 
issued. Thus, such documents, in a way, are also proof of identity. 
However, there is a fundamental difference between the Aadhaar 
card as a means of identity and other documents through which 
identity can be established. Enrolment for Aadhaar card also requires 
giving of demographic information as well as biometric information 
which is in the form of iris and fingerprints. This process eliminates 
any chance of duplication. ….. It is for this reason the Aadhaar card 
is known as Unique Identification (UID). Such an identity is 
unparalleled.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
9.5 Turning back to the question of whether Aadhar Card can serve as 
a proof of age, a perusal of some High Court judgments reveals that this 
question has been considered on quite a few occasions in the context of 
the JJ Act. Illustratively, in Manoj Kumar Yadav v. State of M.P.5 a 
learned Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court held that when 
it comes to establishing the age, on a plea of juvenility the age mentioned 
in the Aadhar Card could not be taken as a conclusive proof in view of 
Section 94 of the JJ Act. Similar observations have been made in 
Shahrukh Khan v. State of M.P.6 holding that if the genuineness of the 
School Leaving Certificate is not under challenge, the said document has 
to be given due primacy. 
The Punjab & Haryana High Court in the context of 
the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, in Navdeep Singh & Anr. v. State of Punjab & Ors.7 held that Aadhar Cards were not “firm proof 

7 2021 SCC OnLine P&H 4553 

8| SLP(C) Nos.23939-40 of 2023 
 
of age”. Observations similar in nature were also made in Noor Nadia 
& Anr. v. State of Punjab & Ors.8, Muskan v. State of Punjab9 as well 
as several other orders/judgments, in various contexts. 
Views aligning with the one referred to above have been taken by 
the 
High 
Court 
of 
Judicature 
of 
Allahabad 
in 
Parvati 
Kumari v. State of U.P.10; the Himachal Pradesh High Court in Kumit 
Kumar v. State of H.P.11 and the High Court of Kerala in Sofikul Islam 
v. State of Kerala12. 
9.6 We find that the Unique Identification Authority of India13, by way 
of its Circular No.08 of 2023, has stated, in reference to an Office 
Memorandum issued by the Ministry of Electronics and Information 
Technology dated 20th December 2018, that an Aadhar Card, while can 
be used to establish identity, it is not per se proof of date of birth. This 
office memorandum dated 20th December, 2018 was taken note of by a 
learned Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in State of 
Maharashtra v. Unique Identification Authority of India And Ors.14 in

its order dated 28th July, 2023. The Circular is extracted hereinbelow for 
ready reference:-

Unique Identification Authority of India

Dated 22.12.2023 

Circular No.08 of 2023 

Subject: Accepting Aadhar as a proof of Date of Birth (DoB) – regarding. 

It has been observed that AUAs/KUAs are considering and accepting Aadhar card / 
e-Aadhaar as one of the acceptable documents for proof of Date of Birth (DoB). 
 
2. 
In this regard, it is pertinent to mention that, Aadhaar is a unique 12 digit ID issued 
to a resident after he/she undergoes the enrolment process by submitting his/her demographic 
and biometric information. Once a resident is assigned an Aadhaar number, it can be used to 
authenticate the resident through various modes as prescribed under Aadhaar Act, 2016 and 
Regulations framed there under. 
 
3. 
At the time of enrolment/updation, UIDAI records DoB as claimed by the resident, 
on the basis of the documents submitted by them, as specified under the list of supporting 
documents 
for 
Aadhaar 
enrolment, 
provided 
on 
the 
UIDAI 
website 
(https://uidai.gov.in/images/commdoc/26 JAN 2023 Aadhar List of documents English.pdf). 
Further, it is to be noted that Regulations 10(4) and 19A of the Aadhaar (Enrolment and 
UPDATE) Regulations, 2016, mention that verification of the enrolment and update data 
shall be performed as provided in Schedule III. 
 
4. 
In this regard, attention is drawn towards Office Memorandum dated 2-0.12.2018 
issued by MeitY through UIDAI, where it has been stated that “An Aadhaar number can be 
used for establishing identity of an individual subject to authentication and thereby, per se 
its not a proof of date of birth” (copy enclosed). 
 
5. 
This aspect of the Aadhar Act, 2016 has been reiterated/highlighted/stressed upon by 
different High Courts in recent judgments. The most recent one is given by the Hon’ble High 
Court of Bombay, in the case of State of Maharashtra V/S Unique Identification Authority 
of India And Ors. dated 28.07.2023 (copy enclosed). 
 
6. 
In view of the above, it is required that use of Aadhaar, as a proof of DoB needs to be 
deleted from the list of acceptable documents. 
 
7. 
This issues with the approval of the Competent Authority. 

Encl: As above.

9.7 Judicial notice has also been taken of the circular above. Recently, 
a learned Single Judge of the Gujarat High Court in Gopalbhai 
Naranbhai Vaghela v. Union Of India & Anr.15 in view thereof directed 
the release of the petitioner's pension in accordance with the date as 
mentioned in the School Leaving Certificate, keeping aside the 
difference in the date of birth as mentioned in the Aadhar Card, which 
was not relevant for the purpose of such consideration. 
9.8 In Shabana v. NCT of Delhi16 a learned Division Bench of the Delhi 
High Court in a case where the petitioner-mother sought a writ of habeas 
corpus for her daughter, recorded a statement made for and on behalf of 
UIDAI that “Aadhar Card may not be used as proof of date of birth.” 
9.9 Here, we may clarify that we have not expressed any view on the 
merits of these cases before their respective High Courts, and reference 
has only been made to them for the limited purpose of examining the 
suitability of the Aadhar Card as proof of age. 
 
15 Order dated 26th February, 2024 passed in R/ 
16 2024 SCC OnLine Del 5058. Judgment dated 24th July, 2024. 

11| SLP(C) Nos.23939-40 of 2023 
 
10. That being the position, as it stands with respect to the determination of age, 
we have no hesitation in accepting the contention of the claimant-appellants, 
based on the School Leaving Certificate. Thus, we find no error in the learned 
MACT’s determination of age based on the School Leaving Certificate. 
11. On another aspect, i.e., the interest awarded, we find there to be no reason 
recorded by the High Court in the reduction of the rate of interest from 7.5% to 
6%. The High Courts cannot lose sight of the fact that compensation received 
by way of claims filed before MACT is either born out of injury or death of the 
claimant or family member of the claimants and so, the amount awarded must 
do justice to them. It necessarily has to be just and reasonable. In that view of 
the matter, we find it fit to enhance the rate of interest to 8% to be paid from the 
date of filing of the claim petition. 
12. In view of the above discussion, we direct that the notional income to be 
taken shall be Rs.9000/- as found by the Tribunal; given that the date of birth is, 
apropos the above discussion, to be taken as 7th October 1970 and consequently, 
the multiplier to be applied is 14. 
13. 
Hence, the compensation payable to the claimant-appellants in terms of 
the principles laid down in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi17 is 
recalculated in tabulated form as under:-
