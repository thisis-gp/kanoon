IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA 
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 

CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. OF 2024 
( SLP(Crl.) No. 6960 of 2021) 

DEVENDRA KUMAR PAL 

VERSUS 
 
STATE OF U.P AND ANOTHER 

JUDGMENT 
 
B.R. Gavai, J. 

1. 
Leave granted 
2. 
The present appeal challenges the judgment and order 
dated 25th August 2021 passed by the learned Single Judge 
of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, vide which the 
petition filed by the present appellant challenging the order 
passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge (hereinafter 
referred to as “learned Trial Judge”) dated 21st March 2012 
was dismissed. 
3. 
The facts of the present case are not disputed. 
4. 
The trial court proceeded with the trial in connection 
with the offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian 

Penal Code, 1860 (for short “IPC”). 
5. 
After the conclusion of the trial, the learned Trial Judge 
convicted some of the accused and acquitted the others. 
6. 
The learned Trial Judge was also of the opinion that the 
present appellant was also required to be tried. 
7. 
By an order dated 21st March 2012, the learned Trial 
Judge in the first half recorded the order of conviction in 
respect of the accused whom it had found to be guilty and 
also recorded the order of acquittal for the remaining 
accused, it found to be not guilty. Post lunch, the learned 
Trial Judge first recorded the order of sentence insofar as the 
accused who were convicted. Thereafter, the learned trial 
Judge had passed an order summoning the present 
appellant, Devendra Kumar Pal for trial by invoking powers 
under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 
(for short, “Cr.P.C.”) 
8. 
We have heard Mr. Puneet Singh Bindra, learned 
counsel appearing for the appellant and Mr. Vishnu Shankar 
Jain, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-State. 
9. 
Shri Bindra, learned counsel submits that in the case of 

Sukhpal Singh Khaira vs. State of Punjab1, the matter 
was referred to the Constitution Bench for deciding the 
question as to “whether the Trial Court had power under 
Section 319 of Cr.P.C. for summoning an additional accused 
when the trial with respect to other co-accused has ended 
and the judgment of conviction and sentence was rendered 
before summoning the additional accused”. Relying on the 
same, he submits that, since in the present case also, first 
the order of conviction and sentence was recorded and only 
thereafter an order under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. was passed, 
the same would not be sustainable in law. 
10. Shri Jain, learned counsel, on the contrary, submits 
that the Constitution Bench has held that if the judgment of 
the conviction and sentence and the order of summoning 
under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. are passed on the same date, 
the Court may have to examine the facts and circumstances 
of the case. He submits that in the present case, the order of 
sentence and the order under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. are 
passed by the learned Trial Judge in the same breath and, 
therefore, no error could be found with the same.

11. The issue is no more res integra. 
12. It will be relevant to refer to paragraph 33 of the 
judgment passed by the Constitution Bench of this Court in 
the case of Sukhpal Singh Khaira (supra), which reads 
thus: 
“33. For all the reasons stated above, we answer the 
questions referred as hereunder:- 
 “I. Whether the trial court has the power 
under 
Section 

of 
CrPC 
for 
summoning additional accused when the 
trial with respect to other co-accused has 
ended and the judgment of conviction 
rendered 
on 
the 
same 
date 
before 
pronouncing the summoning order? 
 
The power under Section 319 of CrPC is to be 
invoked and exercised before the pronouncement of 
the order of sentence where there is a judgment of 
conviction of the accused. In the case of acquittal, 
the power should be exercised before the order of 
acquittal is pronounced. Hence, the summoning 
order has to precede the conclusion of trial by 
imposition of sentence in the case of conviction. If 
the order is passed on the same day, it will have to 
be examined on the facts and circumstances of each 
case and if such summoning order is passed either 
after the order of acquittal or imposing sentence in 
the case of conviction, the same will not be 
sustainable. 
II. Whether the trial court has the power 
under Section 319 of the CrPC for 
summoning additional accused when the 
trial 
in 
respect 
of 
certain 
other 
absconding accused (whose presence is 
subsequently 
secured) 
is 
ongoing/pending, having been bifurcated 

from the main trial? 
 
The trial court has the power to summon additional 
accused when the trial is proceeded in respect of the 
absconding accused after securing his presence, 
subject to the evidence recorded in the split up 
(bifurcated) trial pointing to the involvement of the 
accused sought to be summoned. But the evidence 
recorded in the main concluded trial cannot be the 
basis of the summoning order if such power has not 
been exercised in the main trial till its conclusion. 
III. What are the guidelines that the 
competent 
court 
must 
follow 
while 
exercising power under Section 319 
CrPC?” 
 
(i) If 
the 
competent 
court 
finds 
evidence or if application under 
Section 

of 
CrPC 
is 
filed 
regarding involvement of any other 
person in committing the offence 
based on evidence recorded at any 
stage in the trial before passing of 
the order on acquittal or sentence, it 
shall pause the trial at that stage. 
(ii) The Court shall thereupon first 
decide the need or otherwise to 
summon the additional accused and 
pass orders thereon. 
(iii) If the decision of the court is to 
exercise the power under Section 
319 of CrPC and summon the 
accused, such summoning order 
shall be passed before proceeding 
further with the trial in the main 
case. 
(iv) If the summoning order of additional 
accused is passed, depending on the 
stage at which it is passed, the 

Court shall also apply its mind to 
the 
fact 
as 
to 
whether 
such 
summoned accused is to be tried 
along with the other accused or 
separately. 

If the decision is for joint trial, the 
fresh trial shall be commenced only 
after securing the presence of the 
summoned accused. 
(vi) If the decision is that the summoned 
accused can be tried separately, on 
such order being made, there will be 
no impediment for the Court to 
continue and conclude the trial 
against the accused who were being 
proceeded with. 
(vii) If the proceeding paused as in (i) 
above is in a case where the accused 
who were tried are to be acquitted 
and 
the 
decision 
is 
that 
the 
summoned accused can be tried 
afresh separately, there will be no 
impediment to pass the judgment of 
acquittal in the main case. 
(viii) If the power is not invoked or 
exercised in the main trial till its 
conclusion and if there is a split-up 
(bifurcated) case, the power under 
Section 319 of CrPC can be invoked 
or exercised only if there is evidence 
to that effect, pointing to the 
involvement 
of 
the 
additional 
accused to be summoned in the 
split up (bifurcated) trial. 
(ix) If, after arguments are heard and 
the case is reserved for judgment 
the occasion arises for the Court to 
invoke and exercise the power under 
Section 

of 
CrPC, 
the 
appropriate course for the court is 

to set it down for re-hearing. 
(x) On setting it down for re-hearing, 
the above laid down procedure to 
decide about summoning; holding of 
joint trial or otherwise shall be 
decided 
and 
proceeded 
with 
accordingly. 
(xi) Even in such a case, at that stage, if 
the 
decision 
is 
to 
summon 
additional accused and hold a joint 
trial the trial shall be conducted 
afresh and de novo proceedings be 
held. 
(xii) If, in that circumstance, the decision 
is to hold a separate trial in case of 
the summoned accused as indicated 
earlier; 
(a) The main case may be decided 
by pronouncing the conviction 
and sentence and then proceed 
afresh 
against 
summoned 
accused. 
(b) In the case of acquittal the order 
shall be passed to that effect in 
the main case and then proceed 
afresh 
against 
summoned 
accused.” 
 
13. Indisputably, in the present case, on 21st March 2012, 
the order of conviction in the case of some of the accused and 
the order of acquittal in the case of the other accused was 
passed in the first half of the day. In the second half, the 
Court first passed an order for sentencing of the persons who 
were convicted and only thereafter passed an order under 

Section 319 of Cr.P.C. for summoning the present appellant. 
14. The Constitution Bench has clearly held that if such a 
summoning order is passed, either after the order of acquittal 
or imposing of sentence in the conviction, the same may not 
be sustainable. 
15. Sitting in a two-judge combination, we are bound by the 
law laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court. 
16. As a result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned 
judgment and order dated 25th August 2021 passed by the 
learned Single Judge of the High Court, so also the order of 
summoning passed by the learned Trial Judge dated 21st 
March 2012 in respect of the present appellant under Section 
319 of Cr.P.C. are quashed and set aside. 
17. Pending application(s), if any, stand(s) disposed of.
