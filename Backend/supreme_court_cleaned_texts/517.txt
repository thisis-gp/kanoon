IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA 
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 

KAUSHIK PREMKUMAR MISHRA 
& ANR. 

VERSUS 
KANJI RAVARIA 
& ANR. 

JUDGMENT 
 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 
 
1. “Law is the king of kings, nothing is mightier than 
law, by whose aid, even the weak may prevail 
over the strong.” 
The power structures of our society are such that 
the weaker ones often find themselves exploited 
and oppressed by those who yield greater power. 
Land ownership is one such arena where we see 
the swords of powerplay being sharpened with 
continued fraud, deceit, and greed. While we 
shall deal with the facts of the present case in 
detail later, it is a classic example of continued 

suffering faced by the common man owing to 
mala fide intentions of the vendors who try to 
gain double-benefits, either by arm-twisting or 
through manipulation of the legal processes. 
Sometimes, the misery of the litigant is deepened 
when such travesty of justice is prolonged for 
decades. It is in cases like these, the law comes 
to the aid of the weak. While adjudicating such 
cases, it is not just the lives and the properties of 
the people that we are dealing with, but also their 
trust in the legal system. In cases like the one 
before us, it is not for us to just mechanically 
analyse the contentious transactions but to also 
ensure that injustice is remedied and nobody is 
benefitted by their own wrongs. Justice knows no 
bias and thus, through its aid, even the weak 
may prevail over the strong. 
2. This 
appeal 
by 
the 
plaintiff 
assails 
the 
correctness of the judgment and order dated 9th 
June, 2022 passed by the High Court of 
Judicature at Bombay, whereby the Second 
Appeal filed by the defendant no.2 (respondent 
no.1 herein) was allowed the judgment of the first 
Appellate Court was set aside and that of the 

Trial Court dismissing the suit of the appellant 
was maintained. 
3. Respondent no.2 was the owner of Survey No.13 
Hissa No.1 measuring 3.40 Hectares situate in 
village Shelwali, Tehsil Palghar, District Thane, 
Maharashtra. Half of the total area which would 
come to 1.70 Hectares on the western side is the 
suit 
land 
purchased 
by 
the 
appellants. 
Remaining half was purchased by collaterals of 
the appellants. 
4. Relevant facts for appropriate adjudication of this 
appeal are as follows: 
(a) Respondent no.2 herein executed a Sale Deed in 
favour of appellant no.1 and his minor brother 
Ambrish Mishra (since deceased) on 02.12.1985 
with respect to suit land and the appellant no.1, 
along with his brother, was put into possession 
of the same. 
(b) On the same date another Sale Deed was 
executed by the respondent no.2 in favour of 
one Param Umakant Mishra and Sohardha 
Jagdish Mishra (collaterals of the appellants) for 
the remaining half portion. 

(c) On 05.12.1985 both the aforementioned Sale 
Deeds were presented for registration before the 
Sub-Registrar, Palghar. 
(d) The Sale Deed in favour of Param Mishra and 
Sohardha Mishra was registered and later on 
their names were mutated in the revenue 
records. However, on account of deficiency in 
stamp duty, the Sale Deed in favour of the 
appellant no.1 and his minor brother could not 
be registered and 
remained pending for 
registration before the Sub-Registrar. As such 
their names could not be incorporated in the 
revenue records and the name of the respondent 
no.2 continued to be recorded. 
(e) It would be relevant to mention that in the Sale 
Deed it was mentioned that the appellant no.1 
is aged 18 years whereas his brother Ambrish, 
was a minor and was represented through his 
natural guardian-mother (Smt. Malti). 

On 8th October, 1999, brother of the appellant 
Ambrish passed away issueless and later on his 
widow re-married, as such, his parents became 
the successors and legal heirs of the estate of 
Ambrish. 

(g) On 3rd December, 2010 respondent no.2 
executed a Conveyance Deed with respect to the 
suit land in favour of respondent no.1. It is the 
same land which was transferred in favour of 
the appellant no.1 and his brother in December, 
1985. 
(h) On 8th June, 2011 the appellants came to know 
about inspection of the suit land by some 
strangers, so they went to the spot. They found 
that 
respondent 
no.1, 
along 
with 
some 
musclemen, was trying to take possession of the 
suit land but on account of suit land being 
protected by fencing, they could not enter. It 
was at that time the appellant no.1 came to 
know about a conveyance deed in favour of 
respondent no.1 on the basis of which he was 
trying to take possession. 

The appellants thereafter made inquiries in the 
office of the Sub-Registrar and came to know 
that there was a sale deed dated 3rd December, 
2010 in favour of respondent no.1 

After obtaining a certified copy of the said Deed, 
which was received on 14th June 2011, the 
picture became clear to the appellant. The fraud 

played on them by respondent no.2 of 
transferring the same property (suit land) in 
favour of respondent no.1, which had been 
earlier transferred in their favour, became 
apparent. 
(k) The appellants then followed up registration of 
their sale deed. After removing the deficiency in 
stamp duty, the sale deed executed on 
02.12.1985 and presented for registration on 
05.12.1985 before the Sub-Registrar came to be 
registered on 14th June, 2011. The above 
incident of interference in possession by the 
respondent no.1 gave rise to filing of the suit. 
5. The appellants along with Premkumar, father of 
appellant no.1, instituted a suit for cancellation 
of sale deed dated 03.12.2010 and for perpetual 
injunction on 27th June, 2011 which was 
registered as Special. 
The vendor was impleaded as defendant No.1 
(respondent no.2 herein) and the subsequent 
purchaser as defendant No.2 (respondent no.1 
herein). The facts as stated in paragraph 4 above 
are pleaded in the plaint as such are not being 
repeated. 

6. Both the defendants filed separate written 
statements. The written statement filed by the 
defendant no.1 averred that the plaintiff was not 
entitled to any of the reliefs; the suit was barred 
by limitation; the land in suit was owned by him; 
that he did not recollect having executed any 
such sale deed in favour of the appellant no.1 
and his brother; that the plaintiff purchasers 
were minors, as such, the sale deed in their 
favour was void; it was also denied that 
defendant no.2 had tried to trespass the property 
and take forcible possession with the help of 
musclemen. 
7. Defendant no.2 in his written statement averred 
that the valuation of the suit was not proper; that 
no cause of action arose to file the suit; that the 
plaintiffs had supressed material facts and 
documents and, as such, the suit was liable to be 
dismissed; that the plaintiff no.1 and his brother 
Ambrish were minors and, as such incompetent 
to contract; that as per section 11 of the Indian 
Contract Act, 18721 the transaction with minor 
 
1 The Act, 1872 

was void and as such unenforceable in law; that 
guardian of minor Ambrish was shown as his 
mother whereas actually it should have been his 
father and therefore also the sale deed was bad; 
that there was no signature of plaintiff no.2 in the 
sale deed; that the widow of brother Ambrish was 
not made a party, as such, the suit was bad for 
non-joinder of the necessary party; that the sale 
deed was not duly registered as per provisions of 
law; that before registration no notice was issued 
to the vendor i.e. defendant no.1; no explanation 
or details were given with regard to the delay of 
26 years in getting the registration; that under 
section 85 of the Registration Act, 19082, the 
documents pending for two years were liable to 
be destroyed, as such, the sale deed was not legal 
and proper; that there was interpolation in the 
documents of sale; that he was bona fide 
purchaser for value and had done so after 
verification of the title from the revenue records 
as also having searched the records of the Sub-
 
2 The Act, 1908 

Registrar; lastly, it was prayed that the suit be 
dismissed. 
8. In the written statement of the respondent no.2 
(defendant no.1) there was no specific denial of 
the execution of the Sale Deed on 02.12.1985 in 
favour of the appellant no.1 and his brother. 
There was also no specific or even general denial 
of not receiving the sale consideration. No suit for 
cancellation of the said Sale Deed has ever been 
filed nor any counter claim was filed by the 
defendants to the suit filed by the appellants 
assailing the sale deed dated 02.12.1985. 
9. On the basis of the pleadings, the Trial Court 
framed the following issues: 
“(i) Do plaintiffs prove that they are in possession and 
occupation of the suit land? 

Do plaintiffs prove that they are owners of the 
suit land by virtue of registered Sale Deed dated 
02/12/1985? 
(iii)Do plaintiffs prove that the defendants were 
trying to take possession of the suit land forcibly 
and unauthorizedly? 
(iv)Do plaintiffs prove that the Deed of Conveyance 
dated 03/12/2010 registered at serial No.9176 is 
void-ab-initio? 

(v)Do plaintiffs prove that they are entitle for relief 
of permanent injunction against the defendants as 
prayed in the suit? 
(vi)Do plaintiffs prove that they are entitled for any 
other relief? 
(vii)Does defendant No.1 prove that the alleged 
Agreement to Sale dated 02/12/1985 is void-ab-
initio? 
(viii)Does defendant No.1 prove that the plaintiffs’ 
suit is barred by limitation? 
(ix)Does defendant No.2 prove that the Sale Deed 
dated 02/12/1985 was not enforceable by law? 
(x)Does defendant No.2 prove that he is bona fide 
purchaser and the possessor of suit land? 
(xi)What order and decree?” 
10. The parties to the suit led evidence, both oral and 
documentary. On behalf of the plaintiffs Kaushik 
Premkumar Mishra examined himself as PW-1 
and further examined Shri Mohan Joshi, 
Advocate as PW-2 and Prashant Mishra as PW-3. 
They also filed documentary evidence which 
included amongst others (i) sale deed dated 
02.12.1985, (ii) certified copy of 7/12 extract of 
suit property, (iii) mutation entry no.668, (iv) 

Form No.1 of Register of Marriages for the year 
2007 and (v) Conveyance deed dated 03.12.2010. 
11. Defendant no.1 the vendor did not lead any 
evidence, either oral or documentary. He failed to 
appear and enter the witness box even to support 
his pleadings made in the written statements. 
There was also no cross-examination of PW-1 on 
his behalf. 
12. Defendant no.2, the subsequent purchaser 
examined 
himself 
as 
DW-1, 
and 
further 
examined Ranjeet Patil as DW-2, Parvez Patel as 
DW-3, Sunit Patil as DW-4, Govind Rawaria as 
DW-5. He also filed voluminous documents 
relating to revenue records, mutation entries, 
search reports, copy of notices and various other 
documents relating to his possession. 
13. The Trial Court, after considering the evidence 
led by the parties, dismissed the suit, vide 
judgment dated 24.02.2016. The Trial Court 
recorded the following findings: 
13.1 Issues Nos.1,2,4,5 and 6 were decided in 
negative, whereas Issues nos. 7, 8, 9 and 10 in 
the affirmative, mainly for the reason that the 
appellant no.1 as also his brother were minors 

at the time of the execution of the Sale Deed on 
02.12.1985, as such could not have entered 
into a contract being a minor and, therefore, 
the Sale Deed was void. 
14. The appellants preferred appeal before the 
District Judge which was registered as Civil 
Appeal No.28 of 2016. The District Judge, vide 
judgment dated 7th March, 2019 allowed the 
appeal, set aside the judgment of the Trial Court 
and decreed the suit. The first Appellate Court 
framed the following points for determination in 
paragraph 14 of the judgment and in the said 
table, it also recorded the outcome of the said 
findings. The said table is reproduced below: 
“14. Heard the Ld. Advocates for both

” 
15. In the analysis, the First Appellate Court 
recorded the following findings also: 

15.1. 
 It held that the title of the property relates 
back to the date of execution of the sale deed 
and not the date of the registration. 
15.2. 
 It held that during the lifetime of the father, 
mother can act as the natural guardian of 
the minor. 
15.3. 
 The defendants having failed to seek a 
declaration 
of 
the 
sale 
deed 
dated 
02.12.1985 being declared void ab-initio or 
for its cancellation, once the document is 
duly registered by the Sub-Registrar, it is 
only the competent Civil Court which would 
have the jurisdiction to declare it as 
cancelled or void ab-initio. 
15.4. 
Merely 
because 
the 
challenge 
to 
the 
procedure has been made with respect to the 
registration, 
the 
submission 
of 
the 
defendants with respect to the delayed 
registration etc. gets washed out. 
16. The said judgment was assailed by way of Second 
Appeal by the respondent no.1, the subsequent 
purchaser (defendant no.2) only. No appeal was 
filed by the respondent no.2 (defendant no.1), 

vendor of the appellant. This appeal was 
registered as Second Appeal No.649 of 2019. 
17. By the impugned judgment dated 09.06.2022, 
the High Court has allowed the same and after 
setting aside the judgment of the first Appellate 
Court, restored that of the Trial Court and 
dismissed the suit. It is this judgment of the High 
Court, which is under challenge in the present 
appeal. The High Court framed the following 
substantial questions of law in paragraph 12 of 
the judgment which are reproduced hereunder: - 
“12. The substantial questions of law 
raised in the appeal are: 
i) 
Whether execution of the sale deed 
dated 02.12.1985 at Exhibit 54 
has been duly proved; 
ii) 
Whether the sale deed at Exhibit 
54 conveys title in favour of 
plaintiffs; 
iii) 
Whether the findings of the first 
Appellate court on the issue of 
execution and validity of sale deed 
dated 02.12.1985 are not based on 
evidence 
on 
record 
and 
are 
perverse.” 
 
18. The High Court recorded the following findings: 
18.1. 
The sale deed in question dated 02.12.1985 
could not be held to be invalid for the sole 

reason that the deed was signed only by the 
vendor and not by the vendees (in favour of 
plaintiffs). 
18.2. 
The fact that the purchasers were minors 
would not per se affect the validity of the sale 
deed (in favour of plaintiffs). 
18.3. 
It criticizes the findings of the first Appellate 
Court 
regarding 
the 
sale 
deed 
dated 
02.12.1985 having been validly proved by 
the 
plaintiffs 
to 
be 
not 
based 
on 
consideration of material facts on record as 
discussed and considered by the Trial Court 
while holding that the sale deed was not 
validly proved. 
18.4. 
It considered in great detail the provisions of 
the Registration Act to hold that the sale 
deed dated 02.12.1985 was not validly 
registered, as such, could not have been 
relied upon by the plaintiffs for any of the 
reliefs claimed by them or to maintain the 
suit. 
19. We have heard Shri Vinay Navare, learned senior 
counsel for the appellants, Shri Ranjit Kumar, 
learned senior counsel appearing for respondent 

No.2 and Shri Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior 
counsel representing respondent No.1. 
20. The submissions of Shri Navare for the appellant 
may be summarized as under: 
20.1. 
Respondent No.2 did not specifically deny 
execution of the sale deed in favour of 
appellant no.1 and his brother. He has only 
stated in the written statement that he does 
not recollect to have executed any such 
document. 
20.2. 
Respondent No.2 did not cross-examine the 
appellant No.1 who had entered the witness 
box. The appellant No.1 had specifically 
stated, not only in the plaint but also in his 
deposition, 
that 
respondent 
No.2 
had 
executed the sale deed on 02.12.1985 after 
receiving the sale consideration. 
20.3. 
Respondent No.2, although filed a written 
statement making vague assertions but 
chose not to appear in the witness box 
apparently to avoid being cross-examined. 
20.4. 
The first Appellate Court had decreed the 
suit of the appellant but no appeal was filed 
against the same by the respondent No.2. 

The only appeal filed before the High Court 
was by respondent No.1. 
20.5. 
The objection as to the registration or the 
procedure adopted while registering the sale 
deed was essentially available to respondent 
No.2 but he did not raise it in the written 
statement. Further respondent no.2 neither 
cross-examined appellant No.1 nor did he 
enter the witness box nor did he assail the 
judgment of the first Appellate Court 
decreeing the suit. 
20.6. 
The only manner in which respondent No.2 
could have challenged the sale deed in favour 
of the appellants was by way of either a 
counter-claim or by way of an independent 
suit praying for cancellation of the sale deed 
by impleading the registering authority, 
which he chose not to do. 
20.7. 
As there was no counter-claim filed by the 
defendant, in particular, respondent No.2, 
the question of validity of execution and 
registration 
of 
the 
Sale 
Deed 
dated 
02.12.1985 in favour of the appellant no.1 
and his brother, could not be tested. 

20.8. 
The Trial Court did not frame any issue with 
respect to the validity of the registration 
process or the registration of the sale deed by 
the registering authorities, after such a long 
gap of 26 years. Without framing such an 
issue, the Trial Court committed serious 
error and a patent illegality in recording a 
finding with regard to the registration 
process and commenting on the registering 
authorities. Even the High Court committed 
the same illegality. 
20.9. 
There is no limitation provided under the law 
for a sale deed which had been executed and 
duly presented before the Registrar for 
registration, for such document to be 
registered within a particular time. Even if 
there was a gap of 26 years from the date of 
presentation till the date of registration, it 
would not make any difference and the sale 
deed would relate back to the date of 
execution once registered. 
20.10. The fact that the sale deed was duly executed 
on 02.12.1985 and thereafter presented for 
registration on 05.12.1985 is apparent from 

the fact that respondent No.2 on the same 
date i.e. 02.12.1985 had executed the sale 
deed for the remaining half portion of Survey 
No.13/1 in favour of collaterals of the 
appellant and further, the said sale deed in 
favour of the collaterals was also presented 
for registration on 05.12.1985 i.e. the same 
day on which the appellant presented the 
sale deed for registration. The sale deed of 
the collaterals was later on registered. 
However, the sale deed of the appellant no.1 
remained pending for registration due to 
deficiency in stamp duty and was finally 
registered in 2011 after the deficiency was 
removed. 
20.11. The registration of the sale deed of the 
appellant even after 26 years could not be 
said to be faulted on that ground alone. The 
said registration was never challenged either 
before superior authority of the registration 
department or before the High Court under 
Article 226 of the Constitution. Till date there 
is no challenge to the said sale deed in favour 
of the appellant either on the ground of non-

execution by respondent No.2 or on the 
ground of the registration being faulty before 
any forum whatsoever. 
20.12. Reference to the deposition of appellant No.1 
has been made to submit that the appellant 
No.1 
nowhere 
stated 
that 
no 
sale 
consideration was paid but he only stated 
that he had not placed any documents on 
record to show that the sale consideration of 
Rs.40,000/- had been paid. 
20.13. The arguments advanced on behalf of 
respondent No.1 that the appellant No.1 was 
a minor, as such the sale deed was void, also 
does not benefit the respondents inasmuch 
as on behalf of the brother of the appellant 
No.1, who was stated to be a minor in the 
sale deed, was duly represented by his 
mother, natural guardian. As such the sale 
would, in any case, be valid insofar as the 
brother 
of 
the 
appellant 
No.1 
was 
concerned. 
20.14. The collusion of respondent Nos.1 and 2 was 
writ large and more than apparent from the 
conduct of the respondent No.2; that he did 

not cross-examine the appellant no.1; he did 
not enter the witness box; he did not lead any 
evidence and; he did not file any appeal 
before the High Court. 
20.15. Reliance was placed upon the judgment of 
this Court in the case of Alka Bose vs. 
Parmatma Devi and others3 wherein this 
Court had observed that in India, an 
agreement of sale signed by the vendor alone 
and possession delivered to the purchaser 
and accepted by the purchaser has always 
been considered to be a valid contract. 
20.16. Lastly, it was submitted that the respondent 
No.1, the subsequent purchaser was not a 
bona fide purchaser. The sale deed in favour 
of respondent No.1 has a clause that the 
property was being sold on as is where is 
basis which clearly reflects that respondent 
no.1 had knowledge of the sale deed in favour 
of appellant and about their possession. 
20.17. On such submissions, learned counsel for 
the appellants submitted that the appeal 
 
3 (2009) 

deserves to be allowed, the impugned order 
of the High Court deserves to be set aside 
and that of the first Appellate Court be 
maintained. 
21. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel 
appearing for respondent No.2 made detailed 
submissions which we shall note a little later. He, 
however, did not give any explanation whatsoever 
as to why the respondent No.2 did not cross-
examine the appellant No.1, why the respondent 
No.2 did not enter the witness box in support of 
his pleadings stated in the written statement, 
why no evidence was led by him and why no 
second appeal was preferred by respondent No.2 
against the judgment of the first Appellate Court 
decreeing the suit. The submissions advanced on 
behalf of respondent no.2 are summarized 
hereunder: 
21.1. 
Much emphasis has been laid on the fact 
that the sale deed in favour of appellant was 
registered after 26 years. 
21.2. 
With respect to the arguments relating to 
sale deed in favour of respondent No.1 
mentioning on as is where is basis, the 

submission 
is 
that 
as 
there 
was 
encroachment on the suit property by the 
local tribal people as such this clause was 
inserted so that respondent No.2 would not 
be saddled with any further liability of 
handing over a clear and vacant possession. 
21.3. 
The suit instituted by the appellant as 
framed, was not maintainable inasmuch as 
no relief of declaration of title was sought and 
only relief claimed was for cancellation of the 
sale deed dated 03.12.2010 executed in 
favour of respondent No.1 and further for 
grant of permanent injunction. This was 
deliberately done as suit for declaration 
would be time barred. 
21.4. 
Once the pleadings have been exchanged 
and the issues are framed, the burden would 
lie on both the parties to establish their cases 
and it would be wrong on the part of the 
appellant to argue that the burden would be 
on the respondent alone with respect to 
certain issues. 
21.5. 
The appellant No.1 has admitted that he did 
not know the details of the bank, cheque 

number, the date of the cheque, etc. and that 
he had no documents to show that 
consideration of Rs.40,000/- was paid 
except for the fact that it was mentioned in 
the sale deed. Reference was also made to 
section 25 of the Act,1872 to submit that the 
agreements without consideration are void 
agreements. 
21.6. 
Appellant No.1 had admitted that the 
property was not recorded in his name and 
that 
he 
had 
applied 
to 
the 
revenue 
authorities to record his name which he was 
pursuing from 1996. 
21.7. 
Appellant No.1 declined to produce the 
pleadings of Special Civil Suit No.812 of 
1996, 
the 
partition 
suit 
between 
the 
members of the family. Appellant No.1 
admits of not challenging the Mutation Entry 
No.668 recorded in favour of respondent 
No.1 pursuant to the sale deed dated 
03.12.2010. 
21.8. 
Appellant No.1 admitted of not having 
clearance and prior sale permission from the 

competent authority which was a pre-
condition for purchase of suit property. 
21.9. 
The appellant No.1 admitted that the word 
“cash” in the sale deed was scored out and 
the word “cheque” was mentioned in its place 
and that on some pages of the sale deed, full 
signature of his mother are not there rather 
it has initials. 
21.10. The appellant No.1 admitted that he does not 
remember as to who had presented the sale 
deed for registration in the year 1985 and 
admits that he was not the one who 
presented. 
21.11. With respect to the submission that the suit 
was not maintainable as relief of declaration 
of title was not sought, reliance was placed 
upon the judgment of this Court in the cases 
of Anathula Sudhakar vs. P. Buchi Reddy 
& Ors.4 and Raghwendra Sharan Singh vs. 
Ram Prasanna Singh by LR5. 
21.12. Appellant 
No.1 
had 
admitted 
in 
his 
deposition that he was a minor at the time of 
 
4 (2008), (relevant paras 13-16, 21) 
5 (2020) (para 7-10). the execution of the sale deed on 02.12.1985 
and the age shown in the sale deed that he 
was 18 years was incorrect. Under Section 
11 of the Act, 1872 a minor is not competent 
to enter into a contract and as the appellant 
No.1 admitted that he was a minor at the 
time of the sale deed, the said contract would 
be void ab initio. Reliance was placed upon a 
judgment of this Court in the case of Mathai 
Mathai vs. Joseph Mary & Ors.6. 
21.13. The burden of proof was on the plaintiff, who 
has based the suit on the sale deed dated 
02.12.1985 to prove the same to be a valid 
sale. As the Trial Court recorded the finding 
that the appellants had failed to establish 
their right, title and interest in the suit 
property, there was shifting of the onus on 
the respondent No.2 would not arise and 
there was no necessity or requirement of the 
respondent No.2 to enter the witness box as 
the same would be of no consequence. 
Reliance was placed upon the judgment of 
 
6 (2015) (para 16-19). this Court in Smriti Debbarma vs. Prabha 
Ranjan Debbarma7. 
21.14. Referring to section 114 of the Indian 
Evidence Act,18728 regarding presumption 
of existence of certain facts by the Court, it 
was submitted that although the said 
presumption is rebuttable but as the 
appellant No.1 in his cross-examination has 
made 
various 
admissions 
which 
were 
sufficient to decide the fate of the suit against 
him, it was not necessary for the respondent 
no.2 to either cross-examine him or to enter 
the witness box. Reliance was placed upon 
the judgment of this Court in the case of 
Kunda wd/o Mahadeo Supare & Ors. vs. 
Haribhau s/o Husan Supare9. 
21.15. Appellant No.1 also admits that serial 
numbers 
of 
the 
stamps 
are 
not 
in 
continuation and that regular registration 
process of the sale deed was not complete at 
 
7 (2023) SCC On Line SC 9 (para 35). 
8 The Evidence Act 
9 (2014) 5 Mah. L.J.726 (para 8). the time when the sale deed of 2010 in favour 
of respondent No.1 was registered. 
21.16. Relying upon section 54 of the Transfer of 
Property Act, 188210 read with section 17 
and 

of 
the 
Registration 
Act, 
the 
submission is that an unregistered sale deed 
could not have been received in evidence as 
no title would pass on the basis of an 
unregistered 
document 
relating 
to 
immovable property. As such the respondent 
No.2 continued to be the owner of the suit 
property holding a valid title over the same. 
Reliance has been placed upon the following 
judgments: 
• Raghunath & Ors. vs. Kedar Nath11; 
• Bondar Singh & Ors. Vs. Nihal Singh & 
Ors.12; 
• Suraj Lamps and Industries Pvt. Ltd. vs. 
State of Haryana and Anr.13; 
 
10 The TP Act 
11 (1969) (para 3); 
12 (2003) (para 5); 
13 (2009) (para 15-18); 

• S. Kaladevi v. V.R. Somasundaram & 
Ors.14; and 
• M/s Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd. vs. 
Amit Chand Mitra & Anr.15. 
21.17. Lastly it was submitted that as mandatory 
legal conditions were not fulfilled for the 
registration 
of 
the 
sale 
deed 
dated 
02.12.1985, the same could not have been 
treated as a registered sale deed. 
21.18. To elaborate the above argument following 
further facts were stated: 
a) 
Appellant No.1 in his cross-examination (at 
Pg.135) has admitted that Defendant No.1 
(original Vendor) was not called for completing 
process of registration on 14.06.2011 and that 
there is no endorsement of the Sub-Registrar on 
the last page of Sale Deed about completion of 
registration. Therefore, the mandates of Section 
60, which prescribes as to what constitutes a 
Certificate of registration is not fulfilled and 
hence, the alleged sale deed was not validly 
registered on 14.06.2011 and therefore, alleged 
 
14 (2010) [para 12,13,15] 
15 SLP No.15774 of 2023. sale deed dated 02.12.1985 cannot be treated as 
a registered sale deed. b) 
That the alleged sale deed was registered in 
violation of Section 32 of the Indian Stamp Act, 
1899 and Sections 17 and 20 of the Act, 1908. 
The essential requirement under Section 54 of 
the TP Act were also not fulfilled. That from the 
record as well as the admission of appellant 
no.1, it is clear from the serial number of the 
stamps that the same are not in continuum. c) 
As per Section 32 of the Stamp Act when any 
instrument is brought to the Collector then the 
Collector may determine the Stamp Duty. That 
in the present case, the alleged Sale Deed shows 
that at the time of presentation the stamp of 
Rs.1600/- was given but on 14.06.2011 the 
Sub-Registrar 
accepted 
extra 
amount 
of 
Rs.2200/- and penalty of Rs.500/- but there is 
no endorsement to show that it was sent to the 
Collector for determining the Stamp duty and it 
is not shown in the Sale Deed that deficit stamp 
duty was affixed. As per Sections 33 and 34 of 
the Stamp Act, the Collector has power to 
impound the document. d) 
The alleged sale deed does not show that under 
which provision of law the Sub-Registrar had 
accepted the deficit charges after 26 years and 
no reasons were given as to why it was kept 
pending for such a long time. e) 
Even if assuming for the sake of arguments 
without admitting that the alleged sale deed was 
presented before the Sub-Registrar, the same 
was unclaimed for 26 years and hence, by 
operation of Section 85, documents unclaimed 
for more than two years are required to be 
destroyed. f) 
Compulsory affixing of photograph on the 
conveyance deed is also not followed at the time 
of registration process. Reliance was placed on 
the case of Veena Singh (dead) Thr. LRs. 
District Registrar/Additional Collector16. 
22. Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, learned Senior Counsel 
appearing for respondent No.1, the subsequent 
purchaser, has mainly laid stress on the point 
that respondent No.1 was a bona fide purchaser 
having exercised due diligence as such there 
 
16 (2022) 

would be no justification of cancellation of sale 
deed executed in his favour. 
23. Mr. Ahmadi has also broadly submitted that the 
appellant no.1 had failed to prove the basis of 
claim i.e. the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 and as 
such had not acquired any right, title or interest 
in the suit property. The respondent No.2, 
therefore, was well within his rights to execute 
the sale deed in favour of the respondent No.1 in 
2010. He has also referred to the statement of 
appellant No.1 in order to show certain 
admissions which already have been pointed out 
and noted above in the arguments of Mr. Ranjit 
Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing for 
respondent No.2. In so far as the main 
submission regarding bona fide purchase for 
value without notice, he referred to Section 41 of 
the TP Act, 188217. Reliance has been placed 
upon the following judgements: 
1. Sukhwinder Singh vs. Jagroop Singh and 
Anr.18, 
 
17 TP Act 
18 2020 SCC Online SC 86 

2. Seethakathi Trust Madras vs. Krishnaveni19, 
3. Hansa V. Gandhi vs. Deep Shankar Roy20, 
4. Hardev Singh vs. Gurmail Singh21, 
5. Raghwendra Sharan Singh vs. Ram Prasanna 
Singh by LR22. 
 
24. In 
the 
additional 
written 
submissions, 
respondent no.1 has placed further reliance 
upon two judgments of this Court, for the 
proposition that the sale contract with the minor 
even though he was the vendee, would be void 
ab-initio. The two cases are Mathai vs. Mathai23, 
and another recent judgment dated 15.02.2024 
passed in (, Krishnaveni vs. 
M.A. Shagul Hameed and another. Further, 
reliance was placed upon another judgment of 
this Court dated 15.02.2024 in C.A. No.002458 
of 2024, Babasaheb Dhondiba Kure vs. Radha 
Vithoba 
Barde 
for 
the 
proposition 
that 
 
19 (2022) 
20 (2013) 
21 (2007) 
22 (2020) 
23 (2015) 

conveyance by way of sale would take place only 
at the time of registration of a sale deed in 
accordance with section 17 of the Act, 1908. 
Lastly, it is submitted that the suit was not 
maintainable as no relief for declaration of title 
was sought for which reliance was placed upon 
judgment of this Court in the case of The 
Tehsildar, Urban Improvement Trust and Anr. vs. Ganga Bai Menariya (dead) through Lrs. and others24. 
25. Both the learned senior counsel for the 
respondents thus submitted that the appeal was 
devoid of merit and liable to be dismissed. 
26. From the submissions advanced and the perusal 
of 
the 
material 
on 
record, 
the 
following 
issues/questions arise for consideration in the 
present appeal: 
1) Whether the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 was 
executed by Respondent No. 2? 
2) Whether the sale consideration was paid with 
respect to sale deed dated 02.12.1985? 
 
24 (2024) 

3) Whether the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 was 
presented for registration on 05.12.1985 or not? 
4) Whether delayed registration of the sale deed 
dated 02.12.1985 would prove to be fatal? 
5) Whether non-mutation would take away the 
right created by the sale deed in favor of the 
vendees? 
6) Whether respondent no.2 had any right, title or 
interest 
left 
in 
the 
suit 
property 
after 
02.12.1985? 
7) Whether the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 was 
void as the vendees were alleged to be minors? 
8) Whether the respondent no. 1 was a bona fide 
purchaser for value by way of a subsequent sale 
deed dated 03.12.2010? 
27. Having considered the submissions advanced by 
the counsels for the parties our analysis on the 
issues stated above is as under. As the 
issues/questions raised are interlinked, they 
have been taken up together in our analysis. 
28. At the outset, it may be relevant to refer to the 
certified/xerox copy of the sale deed dated 
2.12.1985, 
presented 
for 
registration 
on 
5.12.1985, copies of which were filed by both the 

sides under the direction of this Court. We have 
carefully perused the sale deed. The following 
facts may be noticeable from the said perusal: 
(i). The stamp paper had been purchased on 
29.11.1985. 
(ii). The document was prepared and executed on 
02.12.1985 
(iii). The document was presented before the Sub-
Registrar on 5.12.1985. The total value of the 
stamp paper used was Rs 1,600/-. 
(iv). The document was presented by respondent 
no.2, the vendor. 
(v). The document bears the signature of Anees 
Ismail Khoja, respondent no. 2, the witnesses 
and also contains the respective endorsement 
by the Sub-Registrar. 
(vi). The document was impounded for non-payment 
of proper stamp duty. However, on 14.6.2011 
the deficiency in stamp duty of Rs.2200/- along 
with penalty of Rs.500/- and other statutory 
payments of Rs.700/- having been paid, it was 
finally registered in Book No. 1 from pages 141-
147. 

(vii). The document bears the signatures of not only 
the vendor, the attesting witnesses and also the 
necessary endorsement by the Sub-Registrar. 
This makes it abundantly clear that the sale 
deed 
was 
executed 
on 
02.12.1985 
and 
presented 
before 
the 
Sub-Registrar 
on 
5.12.1985. Later on, it was registered on 
14.06.2011. 
 
29. The Trial Court and the High Court had 
proceeded on the premise that the defendant 
No.1 - the vendor (respondent no.2 herein) had 
denied the execution of the sale deed and had 
also denied that he had not received any 
consideration. This premise taken by both the 
Courts i.e. Trial Court and the High Court are 
contrary to the pleadings on record and the 
evidence led during the Trial. There is clear 
misreading of the evidence. In his written 
statement in paragraph 7 defendant no.1 
(vendor) has stated that he does not recollect 
having executed the sale deed. He has not 
specifically denied anywhere in the written 
statement that he had not executed the sale deed 

or that the signatures on the sale deed were not 
his signatures. Thus, the very premise on the 
basis of which the Trial Court and the High Court 
proceeded are perverse being contrary to the 
material on record. Both the said courts also 
failed to take into consideration that defendant 
no.1 the vendor (respondent no.2 herein) neither 
entered the witness box in support of his 
pleadings and to prove them, nor did lead any 
evidence, either oral or documentary, in support 
of his pleadings. There was no justification to 
treat a vague statement in the written statement 
of not recollecting about execution of sale deed, 
to be taken as a denial of the execution. The 
defendant no.1 - the vendor was deliberately and 
mischievously 
avoiding 
to 
make 
specific 
statement either denying his signatures on the 
sale deed or his presentation before the Sub-
Registrar 
or 
had 
not 
received 
any 
sale 
consideration. The Trial Court and the High 
Court fell into the trap of clever drafting and a 
vague statement of defendant no.1. 
30. The Trial Court and the High Court also 
committed a manifest error in recording that the 

defendant no.1- vendor (respondent no.2 herein) 
had 
denied 
having 
received 
any 
sale 
consideration with respect to the sale deed dated 
02.12.1985. In the written statement filed by the 
defendant no.1, there is no such statement 
made. In case he had made such a statement 
then he would be admitting the execution but 
without consideration. Both the Courts again 
misread the deposition of appellant no.1 (PW-1) 
wherein he said that he does not have any proof 
of payment of the consideration to hold that no 
sale consideration was paid. A registered 
document 
carries 
with 
it 
presumption 
of 
correctness unless proved otherwise as per 
Section 114 of the Evidence Act read with Section 
17 of the Act, 1908. In the present case there is 
no such evidence. 
31. The defendant no.1 having not entered the 
witness box and not having led any evidence, it 
was a mere presumption of the Trial Court and 
the High Court to have recorded that defendant 
no.1 denied receiving any sale consideration. 
32. Based upon the aforesaid two factual errors, the 
Trial Court and the High Court wrongly shifted 

the burden on the plaintiff to prove execution of 
the sale deed and also payment of the sale 
consideration. The impugned judgment thus 
suffers from manifest error of law and facts both. 
33. The appeal deserves to be allowed on several 
other grounds which we are dealing hereunder 
and hereinafter. 
33.1. 
It is not disputed by respondent No.2 that on 
02.12.1985, he had executed another sale 
deed with respect to the remaining portion of 
survey No.13/1 in favour of the collaterals of 
the appellants, namely, Param Umakant 
Mishra and Sohardha Mishra. This sale deed 
in favour of the collateral was presented for 
registration on the same date as the sale 
deed of the appellant i.e. 05.12.1985 and was 
thereafter duly registered. The respondent 
No.2 has never challenged the said sale deed 
in favour of the collaterals. It is thus 
apparent that the family members and 
collaterals of the appellants purchased the 
entire survey No. 13/1 measuring 3.40 
Hectares from respondent No.2 in equal 
shares by two separate documents which 

were executed on the same date and 
presented for registration on the same day. 
Despite the fact that specific query was put 
to learned senior counsel for respondent no.2 
with regard to the above aspect, no answer 
was given. In the plaint specific averment 
was made with regard to the sale deed in 
favour of the collaterals. There is no specific 
denial in the written statement filed by 
respondent No.2 about the sale deed in 
favour of collaterals. General denial has been 
made by placing strict proof of liability on the 
plaintiff. 
33.2. 
The respondent No.2 apparently wants to 
take advantage of certain minor aberrations 
and minor technicalities and is also taking 
up self-conflicting pleas. 
33.3. 
The sale deed is sought to be ignored and 
rejected on account of a minor cutting/over 
writing with regard to the word ‘cash’ (Roch) 
by 
‘cheque’. 
The 
fact 
remains 
that 
respondent No.2 did not enter the witness 
box to depose that he has not received any 
sale consideration either by way of cash or by 

way of cheque and further to state that he 
had not executed the sale deed and the 
signatures and thumb impression on the 
sale deed are not his. He also did not come 
forward to say that the signatures and 
thumb impression available in the Sub-
Registrar’s office in the register taken at the 
time for registration also did not bear his 
signatures. 
33.4. 
Another aspect submitted on behalf of 
respondent was that the appellant No.1 in 
his deposition has said that he had no proof 
of the payment of the sale consideration, to 
assert that the appellant No.1 admitted that 
he had not paid any sale consideration is not 
correct. Appellant No.1 was being examined 
sometime after 2013, i.e. after a gap of 28 
years from the date of the sale deed. He could 
not be expected to remember such facts 
distinctly and as such he made a fair 
statement that he did not have any 
document that could prove the passing of the 
sale consideration. This would not, by itself, 
be interpreted to hold that appellant 

admitted 
of 
not 
paying 
any 
sale 
consideration. 
33.5. 
The 
question 
of 
payment 
of 
sale 
consideration would arise only and only if the 
vendor makes a specific statement in his 
pleadings as also in his deposition in support 
of the pleading that he did not receive any 
sale consideration either by way of cheque or 
by cash. There is no such pleading and as 
the vendor did not enter the witness box, 
even if there was any such pleading, there is 
no statement to prove such pleading. Thus, 
the above argument being based on minor 
discrepancy 
in 
the 
statement 
of 
the 
appellant, no benefit can be derived by the 
respondents. The argument is accordingly 
rejected. 
33.6. 
There is one more reason to reject this 
argument. Even if assuming that no sale 
consideration was paid even though there 
was a registered sale deed, it would be at the 
instance of the vendor to challenge the said 
sale deed on the ground of no sale 
consideration being paid. In the present 

case, there is no such challenge to the sale 
deed for being declared as void or being 
cancelled on such ground. Thus also, the 
said argument deserves to be rejected. 
33.7. 
It has also been argued on behalf of the 
respondents that appellant No.1, in his 
deposition, stated that he did not remember 
as to who had presented the document for 
registration. Such statement would not be 
relevant at all inasmuch as the fact remains 
that the document of sale was presented for 
registration on 05.12.1985, which fact is not 
denied. Who presented the document is not 
relevant. It was for the registering authority 
to examine and once the document is 
registered, it is presumed that it was 
presented by the competent person and 
necessary signatures of the vendor and 
vendee must have been taken by the 
registering authority. From a perusal of the 
xerox copy of the sale deed it is apparent that 
there is an endorsement by the Sub-
Registrar that the sale deed was presented by 

respondent no.2, the vendor (defendant no.1 
in the suit). 
33.8. 
The submission with regard to delay of 26 
years in getting the document registered also 
does 
not 
extend 
any 
benefit 
to 
the 
respondents. Non-registration of a document 
duly presented for registration could be for 
many reasons. But once it is registered, there 
is a presumption of correctness attached to 
it, that is to say that the document has been 
duly executed and registered in accordance 
to 
law. 
It 
was 
for 
the 
defendants 
(respondents) to come forward and to 
establish that the document was wrongly 
registered. They did not lead any evidence in 
this respect. Instead, they tried to put 
burden 
on 
the 
plaintiff-appellant 
by 
requiring him to call the Sub-Registrar as a 
witness, which the appellant rightly denied. 
It was always open for the respondents to 
have called for the records of the Sub-
Registrar’s office and also the Sub-Registrar 
in order to find out any mandatory lacuna or 
illegality or lack of procedure not being 

followed with respect to the registration. 
They did nothing of this sort. 
33.9. 
In fact, respondent No.2 did not make any 
bone of contention with regard to the 
registration process and the registration of 
the documents after 26 years by challenging 
the same before the same authority or any 
superior authority or any Court of law. 
Registration of a document carries with it 
presumption of correctness until and unless 
the same was challenged by way of 
independent proceeding or a counter claim. 
In the absence of any such claim, the sale 
deed in favour of the appellants has to be 
treated as a valid document. 
33.10. Much stress has been laid by Mr. Ranjit 
Kumar, and Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi learned 
senior counsel appearing for respondents 
that once the appellant No.1 admitted that 
he was a minor at the time of execution of the 
sale deed and that his age was incorrectly 
recorded as 18 years in the sale deed, the 
sale deed would be void ab initio and would 
not transfer any right, title or interest in the 

favour of the appellants. This submission is 
again liable to be rejected. The sale deed was 
in favour of two persons, appellant No.1 as 
also his minor brother, Ambrish who was 
mentioned to be a minor in the sale deed and 
was 
represented 
through 
his 
natural 
guardian, his mother. The sale deed, 
therefore, in any case, would be valid in so 
far as the rights of Ambrish are concerned. 
Respondent No.2 for 26 years never came 
forward to return the sale consideration and 
for rescinding the contract of sale. His 
intentions are clearly tainted with malice and 
dishonesty. His conduct throughout the trial 
and at appeal stage also reflects the same. 
33.11. The issue of minority of appellant no.1 would 
also not be of any relevance for the reason 
that even if he was a minor at the time of the 
execution of the sale deed and he had so 
stated honestly in his deposition, the fact 
remains that the mother of appellant No.1 
was 
already 
representing 
his 
younger 
brother as guardian who was stated to be a 
minor in the sale deed. She was also the 

natural guardian of appellant no.1, and 
therefore, it would be deemed that she was 
acting on behalf of both her minor sons. 
33.12. The High Court recorded the findings that 
the fact that the purchasers were minors 
would not per se affect the validity of the sale 
deed for the reason that the second 
purchaser Ambrish who was mentioned as a 
minor in the sale deed was represented 
through his natural guardian and mother 
Smt. Malti Premkumar Mishra and also that 
the age of the first purchaser Kaushik was 
mentioned to be 18 years in the sale deed. 
33.13. The respondent no.2 appears to be a 
dishonest person. We are saying so for very 
strong reasons, which are apparent from his 
conduct not only during the trial but also 
acting in collusion with respondent no.1 to 
execute the sale deed for the same land 
which he had already transferred. The issue 
of registration of a document is with the 
State, 
which 
requires 
compulsory 
registration of documents so that it is not 
deprived of revenue by way of stamp duty 

payable on such transfers of immovable 
property. If the purchaser has no means to 
pay stamp duty or exorbitant demand of 
stamp duty is made by the registering 
authority which the purchaser is unable to 
pay at that time but he remains satisfied with 
the fact that the vendor has fairly and duly 
executed the sale deed presented it for 
registration and put him in possession of the 
purchased property which he is peacefully 
enjoying, he is always at liberty to pay the 
deficiency of stamp duty at any point of time. 
The document presented for registration will 
remain with the Registering Authority till 
such time, the deficiency is removed. 
However, this pendency of registration on 
account of deficiency cannot enure any 
benefit to the vendor, who has already 
eliminated all his rights by executing the sale 
deed after receiving the sale consideration. 
He cannot become the owner of the 
transferred 
land 
merely 
because 
the 
document of sale is pending for registration. 
It is the purchaser who cannot produce such 

document which is pending registration with 
respect to the immovable property in 
evidence before the Court of law as the same 
would be inadmissible in view of statutory 
provision contained in the TP Act as also the 
Act, 1908. 
34. Coming to the submission of Mr. Ahmadi, 
learned senior counsel for the subsequent 
purchaser-respondent No.1, his claim would 
come up for consideration only if it is finally held 
that the sale deed of 02.12.1985 was not a valid 
sale deed. As otherwise all the rights, title and 
interest of the vendor- respondent no.2 would be 
curtailed from the date of execution of the first 
sale deed on 02.12.1985. As we have already 
held above that the sale deed cannot be 
discarded as void ab initio, rather we have held 
that it is a valid document of sale, therefore, no 
benefit can be extended to respondent no.1. 
Respondent no.1 would enter the shoes of the 
respondent no.2. If respondent no.2 
had 
alienated all his rights, title and interest and also 
delivered possession, respondent no.1 could not 

claim to be a bona fide purchaser for value 
without notice. 
35. The doctrine of bona fide purchaser for value 
applies in situations where the seller appears to 
have some semblance of legitimate ownership 
rights. However, this principle does not protect a 
subsequent purchaser if the vendor had already 
transferred those rights through a prior sale 
deed. In a case where the vendor deceitfully 
executes a second sale deed 26 years after the 
initial transfer, without disclosing the earlier 
transaction and without any ongoing litigation 
regarding 
the 
property, 
the 
subsequent 
purchaser cannot claim the benefits of a bona 
fide purchaser. Essentially, if the vendor's rights 
were already severed by the first sale, any later 
sale deed made without transparency and in bad 
faith is invalid. The subsequent purchaser, even 
if unaware of the prior sale, cannot be considered 
bona fide because the vendor no longer had the 
legal right to sell the property. Thus, the 
protection afforded by the bona fide purchaser 
doctrine is nullified by the vendor's deceitful 
conduct and the pre-existing transfer of rights. 

This ensures that the original purchaser's rights 
are upheld and prevents unjust enrichment 
through fraudulent transactions. 
36. This is not a case of agreement to sell in favour 
of appellants but is a case of sale deed 
transferring ownership rights and possession. It 
would be open to respondent no.1 to avail such 
remedy as may be available under law to recover 
the sale consideration paid by him to respondent 
No.2. The sale deed in favour of the respondent 
No.1 dated 03.12.2010 needs to be cancelled and 
the registering authority be directed to score out 
the same from the records as directed by the first 
Appellate Court. 
37. Another argument raised that the sale deed did 
not contain the signatures of the mother also 
deserves to be rejected. Prior to insertion of 
section 32A in the Act, 1908 in the year 2001 
there was no requirement under law that the 
vendee must mandatorily sign the document of 
sale for immovable property and also affix 
passport size photograph and thumb impression 
along with proof of identification. In the present 

case the sale deed was presented for registration 
in 1985, much before 2001. 
38. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior Counsel 
appearing for Respondent No. 2, has relied upon 
the following judgments in order to substantiate 
his arguments pertaining to the issue of 
registration of the sale deed: 
a. Raghunath Singh & Ors. v. Kedar Nath25, 
b. Bondar Singh & Ors. v. Nihal Singh & 
Ors.26, 
c. Suraj Lamps and Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. 
State of Haryana and Anr.27, 
d. S. Kaladevi v. V.R. Somasundaram & 
Ors.28, 
e. M/s Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. 
Amit Chand Mitra & Anr.29, 
f. Maya Devi v. Lalta Prasad30, 
g. Veena Singh (dead) thr. LRs. v. District 
Registrar/Additional Collector31 
 
25 (1969) 
26 (2003) 
27 (2009) 
28 (2010) 
29 SLP (C )No.15774 of 2023 decided on 25.09.2023 
30 (2015) 
31 (2022) 

39. We observe that the cases relied upon by the 
Respondent No. 2 do not extend any kind of 
benefit in the facts of the present case as the 
judgments above are clearly distinguishable on 
facts. Thus, to avoid lending any further burden 
on the instant judgment, we are not dealing with 
them on their individual facts. 
40. In view of the discussions made above, the appeal 
deserves to be allowed. The impugned judgement 
of the High Court is set aside and that of the first 
Appellate Court decreeing suit of the appellant is 
restored and maintained. 
41. Facts of this case deserves that the suit should 
be decreed with exemplary costs considering the 
conduct of the defendant-respondents, which is 
quantified at Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees ten lakhs 
only) to be paid to the appellants within eight 
weeks from today. The liability to pay costs shall 
be borne equally by each of the two respondents. 
Proof of payment of costs may be filed before this 
Court within ten weeks from today. 

42. Pending application(s), if any, is/are disposed of.
