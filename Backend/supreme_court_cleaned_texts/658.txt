JUDGMENT 

K.V. Viswanathan, J. 
 
1. 
Leave granted. 
2. 
The present appeal calls in question the correctness of 
the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of 
Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur dated 27.04.2022 in D.B. 
Special Appeal. By the said judgment, 
the Division Bench dismissed the appeal of the appellant and 

confirmed the order dated 27.11.2018 of the learned Single 
Judge dismissing the writ petition of the appellant. 
3. 
We have heard Mr. Nishant Bishnoi, learned counsel for 
the appellant and Mr. Milind Kumar, learned counsel for the 
respondent-State and perused the records of the case. We have 
also considered the written submissions filed by the parties. 
4. 
The facts lie in a very narrow compass. The respondent-
authorities under the provisions of the Rajasthan Panchayati 
Raj Act, 1994 and the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Rules, 1996, 
on 11.09.2017, issued an advertisement inviting applications 
for the post of Teacher Grade III Level II in the Scheduled 
Area (TSP). A total of 1455 posts were advertised. The 
relevant clauses of the advertisement were as under:- 
“6.

"6.3 In seriatim of the judgment dated 20.5.2011 passed 
in various petitions by the Division Bench of Hon'ble High 
Court, 
Jodhpur, 
according 
to 
School 
Education 
Department, Rajasthan letter number F 7(1)/Plan/2011 
dated 17th June 2011, the following candidates would also 

be eligible to participate in Rajasthan High Primary School 
Teachers Direct Recruitment 2016 (amended):- 

All such candidates who have taken admission in 
teacher training courses before issuance of notification 
dated 27.09.07 by the National Teachers Education 
Council; for them there is no binding to secure minimum 
percentage in graduation level or equivalent examination. 

All such candidates who have after issuance of 
notification dated 27.09.07 by the National Teachers 
Education Council; but before issuance of notification 
dated 31.8.09, for them it is binding to secure minimum 45 
percent at graduation level or equivalent examination. 

All such candidates who had taken admission in 
various teachers training courses after issuance of 
notification dated 31.8.09 of National Council for Teacher 
Education, for them it is binding to secure minimum 50 
percent at graduation level or equivalent examination." 

(Emphasis supplied) 
 
5. 
The appellant applied for the post of Teacher under the 
said advertisement. It is undisputed that the appellant had 
44.58% marks in his graduation. It is also undisputed that the 
appellant secured admission in the Bachelor of Education 
(B.Ed) course on 23.10.2009 i.e. the date on which he 
deposited the fee. This fact is admitted in the counter affidavit 
of the State filed before this Court in Para 7 and in the written 

submissions filed by the State in Para 1. The appellant, being 
admittedly from the reserved category, the qualifying 
percentage required for admission to the B.Ed Course was 
40% marks in graduation (45% for general category) as is clear 
from the 12.04.2019 Press Release. The appellant fulfilled this 
criteria and obtained admission. 
6. 
When the matter stood thus, the appellant’s name did not 
appear in the provisional list of selected candidates despite 
securing 44.58% marks, which was way above the cut-off 
marks. The appellant contends that he was informed that his 
candidature was rejected for the reason that he had secured less 
than 45% marks in his graduation. 
7. 
Being aggrieved, the appellant filed S.B. and one Rakesh Gaur, who was similarly 
situated, also filed S.B. [Rakesh 
Gaur vs. The State of Rajasthan]. Both the writ petitions 
were dismissed on 27.11.2018. Undeterred, the appellant filed 

D.B. Spl. Appl.. Rakesh Gaur filed D.B. 
Spl. Appl.. 
8. 
At this stage, on 13.11.2019, the National Council for 
Teacher Education [NCTE] issued a clarification by way of a 
supplementary notification which stated that minimum 
percentage of marks in graduation shall not be applicable to 
those incumbents who had already taken admission to the 
Bachelor of Education or Bachelor of Elementary Education 
or equivalent course prior to 29th July, 2011. It further stated 
that the notification of 13.11.2019 was to be made applicable 
from 29.07.2011. The relevant extracts of the notification is 
as follows:- 
“(B). After clause (b), at the end, the following proviso 
shall be inserted namely: 
 
“Provided that minimum percentage of marks in 
graduation shall not be applicable to those incumbents 
who had already taken admission to the Bachelor of 
Education or Bachelor of Elementary Education or 
equivalent course prior to the 29th July, 2011. 
 
2. This notification shall be deemed to have come into 
force on the 29th July, 2011.

Note: The principal notification was published in the 
Gazette of India, Extraordinary, Part III, Section 4, Vide 
number F.No. 61-3/20/2010 NCTE (N & S) dated the 
23rd August, 2010 and was subsequently amended vide

Explanatory Memorandum 
 
The amendment notification number F.No. 61-1/2011 
NCTE (N & S) dated the 29th July, 2011 issued by the 
National Council for Teacher Education was challenged 
before the Supreme Court in the case of Neeraj Kumar 
Rai and others Vs. State of U.P. and Ors. in Civil Appeal 
No. 9732 of 2017 and the Hon'ble Court vide its order 
dated the 25th July, 2017 had directed the National 
Council for Teacher Education to issue a clarification by 
way of a supplementary notification regarding the 
percentage of marks specified therein. Necessary 
amendment is required to be made retrospectively from 
the date of notification of the said rules. It is certified 
that none will be adversely affected by the retrospective 
effect being given to the amendment rules. 

 (Emphasis supplied) 
 
9. 
The supplementary notification of 13.11.2019 was a 
sequel to the judgment of this Court in Neeraj Kumar Rai and 
Ors. Vs. State of U.P. and Others [ decided on 25.07.2017]. 

10. It was noticed by this Court in Neeraj Kumar Rai 
(supra) that the 2009 Norms and Standards for Secondary 
Teacher Education Programme through Open and Distance 
Learning System leading to B.Ed. did not provide for any 
minimum percentage of marks in Bachelor’s degree. 
Thereafter, this Court noticed that in the NCTE notification 
dated 23.08.2010, the requirement of prescribed percentage of 
marks in graduation was laid down and on that basis the said 
requirement was incorporated in the 29.07.2011 notification. 
The appellants in Neeraj Kumar Rai (supra) relying on the 
judgments delivered by a Division Bench of the Rajasthan 
High Court in D.B. etc. 
[Sushil Sompura and Ors. Vs. State (Education) and Ors.] 
and the learned Single Judge of the Uttarakhand High Court in 
 etc. [Baldev Singh and Ors. 
Vs. State of Uttarakhand and Ors.] respectively contended 
that in case the admission to the B.Ed. course had been 
obtained prior to the prescription of the minimum qualifying 

marks by NCTE in Bachelor’s Degree, the minimum 
qualifying marks in graduation ought not to be insisted. 
Recording the submission of the learned Additional Solicitor 
General to the effect that the appellants therein are to be treated 
on par, this Court granted relief to the appellants therein on par 
with the relief granted by the Rajasthan and Uttarakhand High 
Courts. 
11. Independently, in the matter of State of Rajasthan vs. 
Ankul Singhal - D.B. Special Appeal, 
by an order dated 08.09.2020, the Division Bench, while 
dismissing the appeal of the State, had the following to say 
insofar as the facts in Ankul Singhal were concerned: 
“Admission to the said post was initiated in terms of 
advertisement issued in the month of April, 2009. 
Eligibility for admission was 45% marks at graduation 
level. Respondent had secured 49.61% marks in his 
graduation examination. Respondent cleared the Pre-
Shiksha Shastri test. Counseling for allotment of colleges 
on merit cum-preference was notified on 04.07.2009. The 
respondent deposited the necessary fee on 07.07.2009. 
First round of counseling was held between 31.07.2009 
and 03.08.2009. Second round of counseling was held 
between 26.08.2009 and 28.08.2009. As per notification 

dated 21.08.2009, respondent was allotted college for 
pursuing Shiksha Shastri course 2009-10 and was admitted 
on 04.09.2009. 

Clauses 9.3(ii) and 9.3(iii) of the advertisement dated 
31.07.2018 read as under: 
 
9.3 The Hon'ble High Court of Rajasthan, Jodhpur 
Division Bench, in order of judgment dated 20.05.2011 
passed in various petitions, according to School Education 
Department, Rajasthan letter number F 7(1) E.E/ 
Plan/2011 dated 17 June, 2011 and clarification dated 
16.09.2013, the following candidates would be eligible to 
participate in Rajasthan Primary and Upper Primary 
School Teachers Direct Recruitment, 2018:- 

All such candidates who have taken admission in 
teacher training courses before issuance of 
notification dated 27.09.2007 of the National 
Teachers Education Council, they are not obliged to 
obtain minimum percentage marks at bachelors 
level or equivalent examination. 

All such candidates who have taken admission in 
teacher 
training 
courses 
after 
issuance 
of 
notification dated 27.09.2007 of National Teachers 
Education 
Council 
but 
before 
issuance 
of 
notification dated 31.08.2009 in teaching training 
courses, for them it is compulsory to obtain 
minimum 45 percent marks at graduation level or 
equivalent examination. 

All such candidates who had taken admission in 
teachers training courses after issuance of 
notification of National Teachers Education Council 
dated 31.08.2009, for them it is compulsory to 
obtain minimum 50 percent marks at graduation 
level or equivalent examination. 

Learned Single Judge rightly observed that the admission 
of the respondent in the course would relate back to the 
date of admission after the first round of counselling which 
took place before 31.08.2009. If that is not so, then an 
absurd classification of homogeneous group of students 
admitted in Shiksha Shastri course in the academic session 
2009-10 would arise and the same would have no nexus to 
be achieved. Thus, some students in respondent's class 
admitted after first round of counseling would be eligible, 
even with less than 50% marks in graduation, to be 
appointed as Teacher Grade-III, Level-Il while the 
respondent who was also from the same class and admitted 
through the same process would not be eligible for 
appointment for the reason of less than 50% marks in 
graduation. 
 
Learned Single Judge rightly held that the said 
uneven and discriminatory situation between equals 
(students of Shiksha Shastri class of 2009-10) would be 
unsustainable and was liable to be declared ultra vires 
Article 14 of the Constitution of India. 
 
Learned Single Judge then rightly drew the 
conclusion that Clause 9.3(iii) read with clause 9.3(ii) of 
the advertisement dated 31.07.2018 entitling eligibility for 
those with 45% marks at graduation who had substantially 
undergone the admission process to Shiksha Shastri course 
and were allotted college for the purpose before 
31.08.2009 though admitted later and the case of the 
respondent would fall in the said category as he had taken 
admission to Shiksha Shastri course pursuant to 
advertisement in April, 2009 when notification dated 
27.09.2007 was operative and as per the said notification 
eligibility criteria was 45% marks in graduation course. 
 
Hence, the learned Single Judge rightly held that the 
case of the respondent was liable to be considered for 
appointment as Teacher Grade-III, Level-Il as per his 
competitive merit in the category subject to his fulfilling 

other requirements eligibility on his application in 
pursuance of advertisement dated 31.07.2018.” 

 (Emphasis supplied) 

 The filed by the 
State against the judgment in Ankul Singhal (supra) was 
dismissed by this Court on 01.02.2021. 
 
12. By an order of 23.10.2021, in the appellant’s D.B. Spl. 
Appl., relying on the NCTE notification 
of 13.11.2019, an interim order was passed directing the 
respondents to accord appointment to the appellant on the post 
of Teacher Gade-III pursuant to the Advertisement No. 02 of 
2017 in question for TSP Area (English subject), if otherwise 
eligible. It is not disputed that the appellant has, pursuant to 
the interim order was appointed. Thereafter, it is contended 
that after the impugned order, the appellant’s appointment was 
cancelled on 07.06.2022. 

13. On 10.03.2022, the D.B. Spl. Appl. of Rakesh Gaur (supra), who was identically situated, was 
allowed by relying on the Division Bench judgment in Ankul 
Singhal (supra). In fact, the said Rakesh Gaur has taken 
admission on 05.11.2009, after the appellant herein. 
14. However, when the appeal of the appellant came up on 
27.04.2022, by relying on D.B. Civil Special Appeal (Writ) 
No. 1205 of 2019 (Dinesh Chandra Damor vs. State of 
Rajasthan), the appeal was dismissed. The appellant herein 
had joined the course on 23.10.2009 whereas as is clear from 
the facts of Dinesh Chandra Damor (supra) that candidate 
has joined on 20.10.2010 i.e. one year and two months 
(approx.) after the cut-off date of 31.08.2009. 
15. The appellant’s case was more akin to the case of Rakesh 
Gaur (supra), who had taken admission on 05.11.2009. We 
are clearly of the opinion on the special facts of this case that 
the Division Bench erred in applying the case of Dinesh 
Chandra Damor (supra) instead of applying the reasoning in 

the judgment in Ankul Singhal (supra) and Rakesh Gaur 
(supra) to the facts of this case. As was held in Ankul Singhal 
(supra), it will be improper to discriminate inter se among a 
homogenous group of students admitted for the academic 
session 2009-10. As was pointed out therein, it could not be 
that those students admitted in the first round of counselling 
would be eligible, even with less than 50% marks in 
graduation, while the others admitted in the subsequent rounds 
of counselling would not be. It was on this reasoning that 
Rakesh Gaur (supra) was given relief. Rakesh Gaur (supra) 
was a case identically situated with the case of the appellant. 
What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander too. 
16. In view of the same, we allow the appeal and set aside 
the impugned judgment of the High Court dated 27.04.2022 
in D.B. Spl. Appl.. We direct the 
respondent-authorities to treat the appointment given to the 
appellant, pursuant to the interim order of the Division Bench 
dated 23.10.2021, as a regular appointment and after 

reinstating the appellant grant consequential benefits. We 
direct that except for the period the appellant actually worked, 
he shall not be entitled to any back wages. However, fitment 
of pay shall be granted. Necessary orders shall be passed 
within a period of four weeks from today. No order as to 
costs.
