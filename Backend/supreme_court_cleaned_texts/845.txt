CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
CIVIL APPEAL NO. OF 2024 
( SLP (C) No.25213 of 2024) 
 
THE STATE OF HARYANA & ANR....APPELLANT(S) 
 
VERSUS 
AMIN LAL (SINCE DECEASED) 
THROUGH HIS LRS & ORS....RESPONDENT(S) 
 
JUDGMENT 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 
1. Leave granted. 
2. The present appeal arises from the judgment and 
order dated 31st January 2019 passed by the 
High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh 
in RSA No. 3818 of 1987. The High Court allowed 
the 
regular 
second 
appeal 
filed 
by 
the 
respondents herein (original plaintiffs), setting 
aside the judgment of the First Appellate Court 
and restoring the decree passed by the Trial 
Court in favour of the plaintiffs. Aggrieved by the 
High Court's decision, the appellants (original 

SLP( 

defendants), namely the State of Haryana and 
the Public Works Department (PWD), have 
preferred this appeal. 
3. The facts of the case leading up to the present 
appeal are as follows: 
3.1 The dispute pertains to a piece of land 
measuring 18 Biswas Pukhta comprised in 
Khasra No. 2348 (0-10 Biswas) and Khasra No. 
2458 (0-8 Biswas), situated within the revenue 
estate of Bahadurgarh, Haryana. The land is 
located on both sides of National Highway No. 
10, which connects Delhi and Bahadurgarh. 
 
3.2. On 28th March 1981, the original plaintiffs, 
namely, Shri Amin Lal and Shri Ashok Kumar, 
filed a suit for possession of the suit property 
before the Court of Sub-Judge 1st Class, 
Bahadurgarh. They claimed ownership of the 
land based on revenue records and alleged that 
the defendants had unauthorizedly occupied 
the land approximately three and a half years 
prior to the filing of the suit. The plaintiffs 
contended that despite repeated requests and 
a legal notice served under Section 80 of the 

SLP( 

Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the defendants 
failed to vacate the land. 
 
3.3. The defendants, the State of Haryana and PWD, 
contested the suit by filing a written statement 
dated 17th September, 1985. They raised 
preliminary objections, asserting that they had 
been 
in 
continuous 
and 
uninterrupted 
possession of the suit land since 1879-80. 
They claimed that their possession was open, 
hostile, and adverse to the plaintiffs, and as 
such, they had become owners by way of 
adverse possession. The defendants also 
contended that the land had been used as a 
store by the PWD and its predecessor entities, 
including the District Board and Zila Parishad, 
for over a century. 
3.4. Based on the pleadings, the Trial Court framed 
the following main issues: 
“A. Whether the State of Haryana has 
become owner of the suit land by way of 
adverse possession? 
B. Whether the plaintiffs have no locus 
standi to file the present suit?” 

SLP( 

3.5 The plaintiffs examined seven witnesses and 
produced revenue records, including copies of 
jamabandis (Exhibits P1 to P9). The defendants 
examined ten witnesses and produced various 
documents, including revenue records dating 
back to 1879-80 (Exhibits D1 to D22). 
 
3.6. On 2nd May 1986, the Trial Court decreed the 
suit in favour of the plaintiffs. It held that the 
defendants had failed to prove that they had 
become owners by adverse possession. Mere 
placement of bitumen drums and construction 
of a boundary wall in 1980 did not constitute 
adverse possession. The plaintiffs had locus 
standi to file the suit, as they were recorded as 
owners in the jamabandis. The defendants' 
possession, if any, was permissive and not 
hostile. 
 
3.7. Aggrieved by the Trial Court's decision, the 
defendants filed an appeal before the District 
Judge, Rohtak. The First Appellate Court, after 
reappreciating the evidence, allowed the appeal 

SLP( 

on 8th October 1987 and dismissed the 
plaintiffs' suit. The Appellate Court held that: 
• The plaintiffs failed to prove their ownership, 
as they did not produce the sale deeds or 
mutation records establishing their title. 
• The jamabandi entries in favor of the 
plaintiffs were doubtful and appeared to be 
manipulated. 
• The defendants and their predecessors had 
been in continuous possession of the suit 
land since 1879-80. 
• The defendants' possession was open, 
continuous, and adverse, thereby perfecting 
their title by adverse possession. 
• The plaintiffs were attempting to grab the 
land by manipulating revenue records. 
 
3.8. The plaintiffs filed RSA No. 3818 of 1987 before 
the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, 
challenging the judgment of the First Appellate 
Court. The High Court framed the following 
substantial questions of law: 

SLP( 

“I. Whether the State can set up the plea 
of adverse possession, and does it imply 
admitting the title of the plaintiffs? 
II. Whether the judgment and decree of 
the Lower Appellate Court suffer from 
illegality and perversity?” 
 
The High Court allowed the appeal, holding that: 
• By taking the plea of adverse possession, the 
defendants impliedly admitted the title of the 
plaintiffs. 
• The State cannot claim title through adverse 
possession against its own citizens. 
• The defendants failed to specifically deny the 
plaintiffs' title as required under Order 8 Rule 
5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
• The 
possession 
of 
the 
defendants 
was 
permissive, as evidenced by the Misal Hakiyat 
of 1879-80. 
• The First Appellate Court erred in shifting the 
burden of proof onto the plaintiffs and in not 
appreciating the evidence correctly. 

SLP( 

3.9. Aggrieved by the High Court's judgment, the 
defendants (now appellants) have approached 
this Court. 
 
4. We have heard Shri Vikramjeet Banerjee, learned 
Additional Solicitor General for the Appellants 
and Shri Santosh Paul, learned Senior Counsel 
for the Respondents. 
5. Mr. 
Vikramjeet 
Banerjee, 
learned 
A.S.G, 
appearing on behalf of the appellant the State of 
Haryana and its authorities, has argued that the 
High Court erred in overturning the well-
reasoned judgment of the First Appellate Court, 
which had dismissed the plaintiffs' suit. The gist 
of his arguments is as follows: 
(i). Plaintiffs' Failure to Prove Title: The 
appellants assert that the plaintiffs did not 
produce 
any 
substantive 
evidence 
to 
establish 
their 
ownership 
of 
the 
suit 
property. Despite opportunities provided by 
the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court, 
the plaintiffs failed to present any sale deeds 
or 
title 
documents. 
Mere 
reliance 
on 
jamabandi (revenue records) is insufficient to 

SLP( 

confer title, as revenue entries do not create 
or extinguish ownership rights. 
(ii). Burden of Proof Misplaced: The appellants 
further argue that the High Court incorrectly 
shifted the burden of proof onto the 
defendants to establish who the real owner 
is. In a suit for possession, the plaintiff must 
stand on the strength of their own title. The 
appellants cite precedents to emphasize that 
the weakness of the defendant's case cannot 
be a ground for granting relief to the 
plaintiffs. 
(iii). Adverse Possession and Limitation: While 
acknowledging that the State cannot claim 
adverse 
possession 
against 
a 
private 
individual, the appellants maintain that they 
have 
been 
in 
continuous, 
peaceful 
possession of the suit land since 1879. Under 
Section 110 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, 
such possession raises a presumption of 
ownership in their favor. Moreover, the 
plaintiffs' suit is barred by limitation under 
Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963, as they 

SLP( 

failed to challenge the appellants' possession 
within the prescribed period. 
(iv). Necessity 
of 
Declaratory 
Relief: 
The 
appellants contend that the plaintiffs should 
have filed a suit for declaration of title before 
seeking possession, especially when their 
ownership was in dispute. Without a 
declaratory decree establishing their title, the 
plaintiffs are not entitled to a decree for 
possession. 
(v). Conduct of the Plaintiffs: The appellants 
highlight that the First Appellate Court had 
termed the plaintiffs as "land grabbers" who 
manipulated 
revenue 
records 
to 
claim 
ownership. The High Court, however, did not 
address these observations or the detailed 
reasoning provided by the First Appellate 
Court. 
6. The 
arguments 
advanced 
on 
behalf 
of 
respondents by Shri Santosh Paul, learned 
Senior Advocate are summarized hereunder: 
(i). Admission of Plaintiffs' Title by the 
Defendants: The respondents assert that the 

SLP( 

appellants did not specifically deny their 
ownership of the suit property in their written 
statement before the Trial Court. By taking 
the plea of adverse possession, the appellants 
implicitly admitted the respondents' title. 
Under Order VIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, failure to deny an allegation of 
fact amounts to an admission. 
(ii). State Cannot Claim Adverse Possession: 
The respondents argue that the State cannot 
perfect title over private property through 
adverse possession against its own citizens. 
Allowing such a claim would be contrary to 
the principles of a welfare State and 
undermine citizens' constitutional rights. 
(iii). Permissive Possession by the State: The 
respondents contend that the appellants' 
possession of the suit land was permissive 
and not adverse. The Misal Hakiyat of 1879-
80 (Exhibit DW10/1) indicates that the 
State's possession was conditional, described 
as "Bikhar Bahali Kaza," meaning till the 
existence of an orchard. Acts such as placing 
bitumen drums or constructing temporary 

SLP( 

structures do not amount to adverse 
possession. The Trial Court rightly held that 
such acts do not constitute possession 
sufficient to establish adverse possession. 
(iv). Establishment 
of 
Ownership 
through 
Revenue Records: The respondents have 
established 
their 
ownership 
through 
continuous entries in the revenue records 
(jamabandis) from 1904-05 to 2019-20. 
Plaintiff No. 1 derived title through a 
registered sale deed dated 5th July 1960, and 
Plaintiff No. 2 through a sale deed dated 12th 
March 1973. Mutations were duly sanctioned 
based on these sale deeds. Revenue records 
are records of rights and are admissible 
evidence to prove ownership. 
(v). Burden of Proof Lies on Defendants: Since 
the appellants did not deny the respondents' 
title, the burden was on the appellants to 
prove that they had become owners by 
adverse possession. The appellants failed to 
discharge this burden. The Trial Court 
correctly 
found 
that 
the 
appellants' 

SLP( 

possession, if any, began in 1980 and was 
insufficient to establish adverse possession. 
7. Having heard the arguments advanced by both 
parties and perused the records, the core issue 
before us is whether the High Court was correct 
in setting aside the judgment of the First 
Appellate Court and restoring the decree passed 
by the Trial Court in favour of the respondents 
(plaintiffs). The appellants challenge the High 
Court's decision on several grounds, which we 
shall address in their turn. 
8. The appellants contention that plaintiff failed to 
prove their title and ownership is completely 
misplaced for the reasons and analysis made 
hereunder: 
 8.1 We find this argument unconvincing for several 
reasons: In their written statement before the 
Trial Court, the appellants did not specifically 
deny the plaintiffs' ownership of the suit 
property. Instead, they primarily relied on the 
plea of adverse possession. Under Order VIII Rule 
5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, allegations 
of fact not denied specifically are deemed to be 

SLP( 

admitted. By asserting adverse possession, the 
appellants have impliedly admitted the plaintiffs' 
title. 
8.2 The plaintiffs relied on jamabandi entries to 
establish their ownership. The jamabandi for the 
year 1969-70 (Exhibit P1) records the name of 
Shri Amin Lal as owner to the extent of half 
share. Revenue records are public documents 
maintained by government officials in the regular 
course of duties and carry a presumption of 
correctness under Section 35 of the Indian 
Evidence Act, 1872. While it is true that revenue 
entries do not by themselves confer title, they are 
admissible as evidence of possession and can 
support a claim of ownership when corroborated 
by other evidence. 
8.3 The respondents have produced copies of 
registered sale deeds and mutation records 
before this Court, which were part of the 
additional documents filed with the counter-
affidavit. Plaintiff No. 1, Shri Amin Lal, derived 
title through a registered sale deed dated 5th 
July 1960, and mutation No. 8329 was 
sanctioned on 20th April 1982. Plaintiff No. 2, 

SLP( 

Shri Ashok Kumar, derived his title through a 
registered sale deed dated 12th March 1973, and 
mutation No. 8330 was sanctioned on 20th April 
1982. These documents establish a chain of title 
and cannot be ignored. 
 8.4 The appellants did not dispute the plaintiffs' title 
in their pleadings or during the trial. The First 
Appellate Court's finding that the plaintiffs are 
not the true owners is based on conjecture and 
lacks evidentiary support. The appellants cannot 
now, at this appellate stage, challenge the 
plaintiffs' ownership without having raised a 
specific denial earlier. 
9. The appellants’ next submission that the burden 
of proof lay on the plaintiffs to establish their title 
is equally not borne out from the records. It is a 
well-settled principle that in a suit for possession 
based on title, the plaintiffs must establish their 
ownership. In the present case, the plaintiffs 
have done so by producing revenue records and, 
subsequently, the registered sale deeds and 
mutation entries. Furthermore, as the appellants 
failed to deny the plaintiffs' title specifically and 
instead relied on adverse possession, the burden 

SLP( 

has shifted to the appellants to prove their 
adverse possession. In the present case, the 
plaintiffs have sought possession based on their 
title, which they have established through 
documentary evidence. 
10. The appellants claim that due to their long and 
continuous possession of the suit property since 
1879-80, they have perfected their title, is also 
not sustainable in law. However, it is a 
fundamental principle that the State cannot 
claim adverse possession over the property of its 
own citizens. In Vidya Devi v. State of H.P1, this 
Court emphatically held that the State cannot be 
permitted to take the plea of adverse possession. 
The relevant paragraphs from this judgement are 
reproduced hereunder: 
“12.9. In a democratic polity governed by 
the rule of law, the State could not have 
deprived a citizen of their property without 
the sanction of law. Reliance is placed on 
the judgment of this Court in Tukaram 
Kana 
Joshi v. MIDC [Tukaram 
Kana 
Joshi v. MIDC, (2013): (2013) 
1 SCC (Civ) 491] wherein it was held that 
the State must comply with the procedure 
 
1 (2020) 

SLP( 

for acquisition, requisition, or any other 
permissible statutory mode. The State 
being a welfare State governed by the rule 
of law cannot arrogate to itself a status 
beyond 
what 
is 
provided 
by 
the 
Constitution. 
12.10. This 
Court 
in State 
of 
Haryana v. Mukesh 
Kumar [State 
of 
Haryana v. Mukesh Kumar, (2011): (2012) 3 SCC (Civ) 769] held 
that the right to property is now 
considered to be not only a constitutional 
or statutory right, but also a human right. 
Human rights have been considered in the 
realm of individual rights such as right to 
shelter, livelihood, health, employment, 
etc. Human rights have gained a multi-
faceted dimension. 
12.11. We are surprised by the plea taken 
by the State before the High Court, that 
since 
it 
has 
been 
in 
continuous 
possession of the land for over 42 years, it 
would 
tantamount 
to 
“adverse” 
possession. The State being a welfare 
State, cannot be permitted to take the plea 
of adverse possession, which allows a 
trespasser i.e. a person guilty of a tort, or 
even a crime, to gain legal title over such 
property for over 12 years. The State 
cannot be permitted to perfect its title over 
the land by invoking the doctrine of 
adverse possession to grab the property of 
its own citizens, as has been done in the 
present case.” 

SLP( 

11. Allowing the State to appropriate private property 
through adverse possession would undermine 
the constitutional rights of citizens and erode 
public trust in the government. Therefore, the 
appellants' 
plea 
of 
adverse 
possession 
is 
untenable in law. The appellants' possession, as 
evidenced by the Misal Hakiyat of 1879-80 
(Exhibit 
DW10/1), 
was 
permissive 
and 
conditional. The entry describes the possession 
as "Bikhar Bahali Kaza," meaning till the 
existence of an orchard. Such permissive 
possession cannot be the basis for a claim of 
adverse possession. 
12. Furthermore, the acts relied upon by the 
appellants—such as placing bitumen drums, 
erecting temporary structures, and constructing 
a boundary wall in 1980—do not constitute 
adverse possession. Adverse possession requires 
possession that is continuous, open, peaceful, 
and hostile to the true owner for the statutory 
period. In this case, the appellants' possession 
lacks the element of hostility and the requisite 
duration. 

SLP( 

13. The appellants last contention that the High 
Court overstepped its jurisdiction under Section 
100 of 
the 
Code 
of Civil Procedure by 
reappreciating evidence and interfering with 
findings of fact also has no legs to stand. The 
High Court had framed substantial questions of 
law regarding whether the State can claim 
adverse possession against its own citizens and 
whether taking the plea of adverse possession 
implies admission of the plaintiffs' title. These are 
substantial questions of law that justify the High 
Court's interference. The High Court found that 
the First Appellate Court had ignored material 
evidence and legal principles, leading to a 
perverse judgment. Therefore, the High Court 
was justified in exercising its jurisdiction under 
Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
14. The findings of the First Appellate Court's 
judgment are flawed for various reasons. The 
court erroneously placed the burden of proving 
ownership 
on 
the 
plaintiffs, 
despite 
the 
defendants' admission of their title by pleading 
adverse possession. The court disregarded the 
jamabandi entries and other revenue records 

SLP( 

without 
valid 
justification. 
The 
court's 
conclusion that the plaintiffs are "land grabbers" 
is not supported by evidence and appears to be 
based on conjecture. Therefore, the High Court 
rightly set aside the First Appellate Court's 
judgment, which suffered from legal infirmities 
and misappreciation of evidence. 
15. In view of the above analysis, we find no merit in 
the appellants' contentions. The High Court's 
judgment is based on sound legal principles and 
correct appreciation of evidence. The plaintiffs 
have established their ownership of the suit 
property, and the State cannot claim adverse 
possession against its own citizens. 
16. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
