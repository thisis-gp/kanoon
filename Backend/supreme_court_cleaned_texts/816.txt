1. 
Since the pivotal question of law involved in all the captioned petitions is 
the same, they were taken up for hearing analogously and are being disposed 
of by this common judgment and order. 
2. 
For the sake of convenience, the filed by 
the Customs Department is treated as the lead matter. 
3. 
This Review Petition has been filed by the Customs Department through the 
Commissioner of Customs, New Delhi (the “Department”) under Order 
XLVII of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013 seeking review of the judgment 
and order dated 09.03.2021 passed by this Court in titled M/s Canon India Private Ltd. v. Commissioner of Customs. 
 
A. FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF THE REVIEW PETITION 

4. 
A two-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Commissioner of Customs 
v. Sayed Ali and Another reported in (2011) SCC 537, had held that the 
Commissioner of Customs (Preventive) is not a “proper officer” as defined 
in Section 2(34) of the Customs Act, 1962 (“the Act, 1962”) and therefore 
did not have the jurisdiction to issue a show cause notice in terms of Section 
28 of the Act, 1962. The Court observed that while all proper officers must 
be “officers of customs”, all “officers of customs” are not proper officers. It 
also held that only those officers of customs who were assigned the functions 
of assessment, which would include re-assessment, working under the 

jurisdictional collectorate within whose jurisdiction the bills of entry or 
baggage declarations had been filed and consignments had been cleared for 
home consumption, would have the jurisdiction to issue show cause notice 
under Section 28 or else it would lead to a situation of utter chaos and 
confusion, in as much as all officers of customs in a particular area, be it 
under the Collectorate of Customs (Imports) or the Preventive Collectorate, 
would fall under the definition of “proper officers”. Section 2(34) is 
extracted below: 
“(34) proper officer in relation to any functions to be 
performed under this Act, means the officer of customs 
who is assigned those functions by the Board or the 
Principal Commissioner of Customs or Commissioner 
of Customs” 
 
5. 
As a result of the decision in Sayed Ali (supra), the Central Board of Excise 
and Customs (the “Board”) issued Notification No. 44/2011-Cus-NT dated 
06.07.2011 under Section 2(34) of the Act, 1962, assigning the functions of 
the “proper officers” to the Commissioners of Customs (Preventive), 
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (“DRI”), Directorate General of Anti 
Evasion (“DGAE”) and Officers of Central Excise. The notification 
specified that it would operate prospectively. With a view to account for the 
past periods, Section 28(11) was introduced vide the Customs (Amendment 
and Validation) Act, 2011 (Act No.14 of 2011) dated 16.09.2011 by virtue 
of which all persons appointed as Officers of Customs under sub-section (1) 

of Section 4 before the 06.07.2011 were deemed to have and always had the 
power of assessment under Section 17 and were deemed to be and always 
have been “proper officers” for the purpose of the said section. 
6. 
The constitutional validity of Section 28(11) of the Act, 1962, came to be 
challenged before the High Court of Delhi in the case of Mangali Impex 
Ltd. v. Union of India reported in (2016) SCC Online Del 2597 and a batch 
of matters were disposed of by the High Court vide a common judgment on 
03.05.2016. 
7. 
The High Court held that although Section 28(11) of the Act, 1962 begins 
with a non-obstante clause, it neither explicitly nor implicitly seeks to 
overcome the legal position brought about by Explanation 2 which states 
that the cases of non-levy, short-levy or erroneous refund prior to 08.04.2011 
would continue to be governed by the unamended Section 28 of the Act, 
1962 as it stood prior to said date. On this basis, it held that the newly 
enacted Section 28(11) would not empower officers of DRI or DGAE to 
either to adjudicate the show-cause notices already issued by them for the 
period prior to 08.04.2011 or to issue fresh show-cause notices for said 
period. 
8. 
The High Court also held that Section 28(11) of the Act, 1962 is overbroad 
in as much as it confers jurisdiction on a plurality of officers on the same 
subject matter which may result in utter chaos, unnecessary harassment and 

conflicting decisions. It held that such untrammelled power would be 
arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. The issue as to the 
constitutional validity and effect of Section 28(11) of the Act, 1962 was 
answered accordingly. The Department preferred an appeal against the 
decision in Mangali Impex (supra) in before 
this Court and vide order dated 01.08.2016, a two-Judge Bench of this Court 
stayed the operation of that decision. 
9. 
The constitutional validity of Section 28 (11) of the Act, 1962 was also 
challenged before the High Court of Bombay in the case of Sunil Gupta v. 
Union of India and Others reported in (2014) SCC Online Bom 1742. The 
two-Judge Bench vide its Judgement dated 03.11.2014 held thus: 
“25. As a result of the above discussion and finding that 
Explanation 2 has not been dealing with the case, which 
was specifically dealt with by sub- section (11) of 
section 28 of the Act, that we are of the opinion that the 
challenge in the writ petition is without any merit. The 
Explanation removes the doubts and states that even 
those cases which are governed by section 28 and 
whether initiated prior to the Finance Bill 2011 
receiving the assent of the President shall continue to be 
governed by section 28, as it stood immediately before 
the date on which such assent is received. The reference 
to the Finance Bill therein denotes the Bill by the section 
itself was substituted by Act 8 of 2011 with effect from 
April 8, 2011. Prior to this Bill by which the section was 
substituted receiving the assent of the President of India, 
some cases were initiated and section 28 was resorted 
to by the authorities. Explanation 2 clarifies that they 
will proceed in terms of the unamended provision. The 
position dealt with by insertion of section 28(11) is 
distinct and that is about competence of the officer. The 

officers namely those from the Directorate of Revenue 
Intelligence having been entrusted and assigned the 
functions as noted above, they are deemed to have been 
possessing the authority, whether in terms of section 28 
unamended or amended and substituted as above. In 
these circumstances, for these additional reasons as 
well, the challenge to this sub-section must fail.” 
 
10. Since the decision in Sunil Gupta (supra) was anterior in time, the same was 
relied upon by the Department before the High Court of Delhi during the 
hearing in Mangali Impex (supra). However, the High Court of Delhi did 
not agree with the view taken therein. 
11. A batch of four statutory appeals came to be decided by this Court on 
09.03.2021 in Canon India (supra) wherein this Court decided the 
following two issues – first, whether the officers of DRI would be “proper 
officers” under Section 2(34) for the purposes of Sections 17 and 28 of the 
Act, 1962 respectively; and second, whether such officers are empowered to 
issue show cause notices demanding customs duty under section 28 of the 
Act, 1962. To elaborate: 
(a) Whether the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) had the legal 
authority to issue a show cause notice under Section 28(4) of the Act, 
1962, when the goods were cleared for import by a Deputy 
Commissioner of Customs (who had decided that the goods are exempted 
from being taxed on import)? 

(b) Whether an Additional Director General of DRI, who has been appointed 
as an “officer of Customs” under the Notification dated 07.03.2002, has 
been entrusted with the functions of “the proper officer” for the purpose 
of Section 28 of the Act, 1962? 
12. This Court while disposing of the aforesaid batch of matters proceeded to 
reiterate the principles laid down in Sayed Ali (supra) that only such officers 
who are vested with the power of assessment under Section 17 can be 
empowered to issue show cause notices under Section 28 or else this would 
result in a state of chaos and confusion. It also held that unless it is shown 
that the officers of DRI are at the first instance, customs officers under the 
Act, 1962 and are entrusted with the functions of a proper officer under 
Section 6 of the Act, 1962, they would not be competent to issue show-cause 
notices. It was held that, since no entrustment was made under Section 6 of 
the Act, 1962, the officers of DRI who were not otherwise officers of 
customs, could not have been assigned as the “proper officers”. 
13. It also observed that from a conjoint reading of Section 2(34) and Section 
28 respectively of the Act, 1962, it is manifest that only such a custom 
officer who has been assigned the specific functions of assessment and 
reassessment in the jurisdictional area where the import concerned has been 
affected, either by the Board or the Commissioner of Customs, in terms of 

Section 2(34) of the Act, 1962, was competent to issue notice under Section 
28 of the Act, 1962. 
14. It appears from the decision in Canon India (supra) that the Notification 
No. 44/2011-Cus-NT dated 06.07.2011 designating officers of DRI as 
“proper officers” for the purposes of both Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 
1962 respectively; the introduction of Section 28(11) vide the Validation 
Act, 2011 introducing Section 28(11) empowering such officers for the 
period prior to 06.07.2011; the statutory scheme as envisaged under Sections 
3, 4, 5 and 2(34) of the Act, 1962 respectively; and the pendency of the 
appeal against the decision in Mangali Impex (supra) and the stay of the 
operation of the said decision by this Court was either not noticed or not 
brought to the notice of the Court. 
15. The Department preferred the present Review Petition against the judgement 
delivered in Canon India (supra) on 09.03.2021. This judgement was 
followed in other cases adjudicated by this Court and the High Courts, 
resulting in various other Review Petitions, Special Leave Petitions and 
Civil Appeals. This Court vide order dated 15.02.2022 in the present Review 
Petition allowed an open court hearing to be conducted and after hearing the 
parties, issued notice on the Review Petition vide order dated 19.05.2022. A 
co-ordinate Bench of this Court later in Union of India and Another v. 

Godrej and Boyce Manufacturing (SLP (C) No. 1513/2022) through order 
dated 11.02.2022 also issued notice. 
16. The aforesaid developments led to a hiatus. As a result, the appeals pending 
before the Tribunals and other authorities could not be decided. This 
necessitated the introduction of the following provisions by Parliament: 
Sections 86, 87 and 88 in the Finance Act, 2022 (Act No. 6 of 2022) to 
amend Sections 2(34), 3 and 5 of the Act, 1962 respectively. Further, 
Sections 94 and 97 of the Finance Act, 2022 introduced a new Section 
110AA and a validation enactment respectively. These amendments came 
to be challenged before this Court in W.P. (C) 526 of 2022 titled Daikin Air 
Conditioning India Pvt. Ltd v. Union of India. 
17. The present batch comprises of three clusters of matters: 
(i) The Review Petitions in the Canon India (supra) batch; 
(ii) The Mangali Impex (supra) appeal and other appeals pending before 
this Court on the issue of whether the officers of DRI would be proper 
officers in light of Section 28(11); and 
(iii) The petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Section 97 of 
the Finance Act, 2022. 

B. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT 
 
18. Mr. N. Venkataraman, the learned Additional Solicitor General of India, 
made extensive submissions on the following broad issues – 

The Review Petitions filed in the case of Canon India (supra) are 
maintainable as there is an error apparent on the face of the record. 

The decision rendered by this Court in Sayed Ali (supra) requires 
reconsideration. 

The decision rendered by the Delhi High Court in Mangali Impex 
(supra) should be overruled and the view expressed by the Bombay 
High Court in Sunil Gupta (supra) should be upheld. 

The changes introduced by the Finance Act, 2022 are merely 
clarificatory in nature and the crux of the issue before the Court can 
be answered without reference to and reliance upon the changes 
introduced by the said Act. i. 
Error apparent in the judgment under review 
19. It was submitted that the judgement rendered by this Court in Canon India 
(supra) requires review as there are errors apparent on the face of the record. 
The Ld. ASG submitted that it is equally important that the legality and 
validity of the decision rendered by the High Court of Delhi in Mangali 
Impex (supra) which is a part of the present batch of pending appeals be 
considered since the issues in both Canon India (supra) and Mangali Impex 

(supra) are one and the same. He submitted that the fact that an appeal 
against Mangali Impex (supra) was pending before this Court and that the 
operation of the said judgement was stayed went unnoticed in Canon India 
(supra). He submitted that this would have a direct bearing both in the 
review and in the batch of appeals before this Court. 
20. He submitted that Canon India (supra) proceeded on the assumption that 
DRI officers are not officers of Customs and therefore need to be entrusted 
with such powers under Section 6 of the Act, 1962 and only upon such 
entrustment, the functions of a proper officer can be assigned to them. This, 
he submitted, is in the teeth of the provisions of the Act, 1962 more 
particularly Sections 3, 4, and 5 thereof. He further submitted that there is 
no discussion worth the name on these provisions as regards its applicability 
to the DRI officers who are none other than a class of officers of customs 
under Section 3 appointed pursuant to Section 4 and consequently, no 
entrustment is required under Section 6. He submitted that Section 6 would 
come into play for such of those officers of the Central or State Government 
or Local Authority, who are not a class of officers of customs under Section 
3 appointed in accordance with Section 4 of the Act, 1962. He explained this 
clear distinction between the two provisions by relying on the notifications 
issued under Section 4 of the Act, 1962 proclaiming DRI officers to be a 
class of officers of Customs under Section 3 of the Act. 

21. He submitted that this Court erred in not taking into consideration Sections 
3, 4 and 5 of the Act, 1962 respectively and its interplay, if any, with Section 
6, as duly indicated by the notifications issued from time to time. More 
particularly, the Court did not take into account the origin and history of the 
DRI and how it was always a part of the Ministry of Finance since its 
inception except for a brief period between 1970 and 1977. 
22. He adverted to Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Act, 1962 respectively along 
with the relevant notifications issued under the respective provisions. The 
provisions and relevant notifications are reproduced hereinbelow: 
Section 3 as introduced in 1962: 
“3. There shall be the following classes of officers of custom 
namely: — 
(a) Collectors of Customs; 
(b) Appellate Collectors of Customs; 
(c) Deputy Collectors of Customs; 
(d) Assistant Collectors of Customs; and 
(e) such other class of officers of customs as may be appointed for 
the purposes of this Act.” 
 
The provision was amended by the Finance Act, 1995 and underwent only 
one change wherein the expression ‘collector’ was replaced by the 
expression ‘commissioner’. The amended provision reads as under: 
"3. Classes of officers of customs.- 
There shall be the following classes of officers of customs, namely.- 
(a) Chief Commissioners of Customs; 
(b) Commissioners of Customs; 
(c) Commissioners of Customs (Appeals); 

(d) Deputy Commissioners of Customs;” 
 
23. He submitted that Section 3 refers to the class of officers of customs. All 
officers of the same rank irrespective of the functions and roles they play 
would fall under Section 3 as class of officers of customs. Class in this sense 
would refer to the same rank. 
24. Sections 4 and 5 of the Act, 1962 are extracted below: 
Section 4: 
“(1) The Board may appoint such persons as it thinks fit 
to be officers of customs. 
 
(2) Without prejudice to the provisions of sub-section 
(7), the Board may authorise a Commissioner of 
Customs or a Deputy or Assistant Commissioner of 
Customs to appoint officers of customs below the rank 
of Assistant Commissioner of Customs.” 
 
Section 5: 
“(1) Subject to such conditions and limitations as the 
Board may impose, an officer of customs may exercise 
the powers and discharge custom the duties conferred 
or imposed on him under this Act. 
 
(2) An officer of customs may exercise the powers and 
discharge the duties conferred or imposed under this Act 
on any other officer of customs who is subordinate to 
him. 
 
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, 
an Appellate Collector of Customs shall not exercise the 
powers and discharge the duties conferred or imposed 
on an officer of customs other than those specified in 
Chapter XV and section 108.” 

25. Section 4 relates to appointment of officers of customs and Section 5 deals 
with the powers and duties of officers of customs. There is only one 
significant change carried out in Section 4 on 11.05.2002. Prior to that date, 
the appointing Authority was the Central Government and post 11.05.2002, 
the Board became the appointing Authority.

 [No. 38/F. No. 4/1/63-CAR.]” 
 
27. Our attention was specifically drawn to S. No. 1 of GSR 214 as extracted 
above wherein the Central Government appointed the Director, Directorate 
of Revenue Intelligence as an officer of customs and also to S. No. 5 of GSR 

215 by which the Central Government appointed all the officers of DRI as 
officers of customs. 
28. He also placed before us the origin and history of the DRI as a part of the 
Ministry of Finance. From 04.12.1957 till 24.06.1970, DRI was with the 
Ministry of Finance. From 25.06.1970 to 28.07.1970, it was with the 
Ministry of Home Affairs. Between 29.07.1970 and 06.04.1977, it was with 
the Cabinet Secretariat and from 07.04.1977 onwards, DRI has remained 
with the Ministry of Finance. 
29. 
Placing reliance on the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of S.K. 
Srivastava v. Union of India reported in 1971 SCC OnLine Del 134, he 
submitted that DRI was always a part of the Customs Department, working 
under a common Board and the Ministry of Finance. The relevant 
paragraphs from this decision are extracted below: 
“(2) Therefore, on 3-12-1970 the order dated 27-7-
1970 was cancelled. 
(3) On 16-12-1970 the President was pleased to order 
that the petitioner “be posted as Collector of Central 
Excise, Hyderabad”. 
The petitioner however refused to join his posting at 
Hyderabad and has filed the present writ petition 
challenging his transfer from the post of Director of 
Revenue Intelligence to the post of Collector of Customs 
as being illegal and unconstitutional. 
Let us first consider the legality of the transfer. Under 
Article 310 of the Constitution, the petitioner held office 
during the pleasure of the President. The conditions of 
service of the petitioner could be regulated by 
Parliament by legislation under Article 309 of the 

Constitution. In the absence of such legislation the 
President could also frame rules to do so under the 
proviso to Article 309. But neither any such legislation 
nor any such rules exist. The formation of the Indian 
Customs and Central Excise Service Class I was itself 
brought about by purely executive action. It is well-
established that the administration of service by the 
Government of India can be carried on by executive 
instructions and executive action even though no statute 
or statutory rules may have been made. 
The distinction between the personnel forming a 
Service and the posts which may be manned by the 
members of such a Service has to be noted at the outset 
in this case. The petitioner along with others belong to 
the Indian Customs and Central Excise Service Class 
I. The members of this Service stood in relation to each 
other in a particular order of seniority. There was no 
statute or rules, however, restricting the appointments 
of the members of the Service to any particular post. 
Initially the officers of the Collectorate of Customs 
and Excise working under the Ministry of Finance, 
Department of Revenue, used to do all the work 
relating to customs and excise. In 1939, the work of 
inspection in the Departments of Customs and Central 
Excise which was till then performed by the 
departments themselves as carved out and given to a 
separate Directorate of Inspection (Customs and 
Central Excise) as a part of the office of the Central 
Board of Revenue which was formed by an Act of 1924 
and which was split later by an Act of 1963 into two 
Boards, namely:— 
(a) Board of Direct Taxes under which functions the 
Department of Income-tax; 
(b) The Central Board of Excise and Customs under 
which functioned the Collectorates of Customs and 
Central Excise, 
Directorate 
of 
Inspection 
and 
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence. 
It was in 1957 that the intelligence work till then 
performed by the Central Revenue Intelligence 
Bureau functioning as a unit in the Directorate of 
Inspection, was constituted as a third unit in the 
Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance styled as 

Directorate of Revenue, Intelligence. All this and more 
information 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
Government 
publication Organisation Set-up and Functions of the 
Ministries/Departments of the Government of India “, 
4th Edition, 1968, pages 68-70 (Annexure R XIII). 
As the work of Directorates of Inspection and Revenue 
Intelligence has been carved out from the work 
originally performed by the Collectorates of Customs 
and Central Excise and as no separate personnel was 
recruited to man the posts in these two Directorates, 
the members of the Indian Customs and Central 
Excise Service Class I have been manning those posts. 
There have been therefore numerous transfers of 
officers of the Indian Customs and Central Excise 
Service Class I from their posts in the Collectorates to 
the subsequently created posts in the Directorates. 
Equally 
frequently 
these 
officers 
have 
been 
transferred back to the posts in the Collectorates. The 
important fact to be noted is that only one set of 
personnel originally recruited for the Customs and 
Central Excise Collectorates has been used to fill the 
posts not only in the Collectorates but also in the 
Directorates. The reason is obvious. The Central 
Board of Excise and Customs in 1963 and prior to that 
the Central Board of Revenue functioning as a part of 
the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance of the 
Government of India administered and controlled the 
work of the Collectorates of Customs and Central 
Excise as well as of the Directorates of Inspection and 
Revenue Intelligence. These three units form one 
whole working under the Board and the Ministry. This 
position is reflected in the following documents:— 
(1) The Central Civil Services [Revised Pay Rules, 1960 
(Annexure R xiv)] have a Schedule in which the 
various posts which could be manned by the Central 
Civil Services are shown with the emoluments 
attached to those posts. In this Schedule section 10 
forms the Ministry of Finance (Department of 
Revenue).…” 
[emphasis supplied] 

30. Having adverted to Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Act, 1962, he submitted that 
the officers of DRI would fall under Section 3 as “class of officers” and 
under Section 4 as “officers of customs” and that the Board is empowered 
to assign and fix powers and assign duties to such DRI officers similar to 
other classes of officers and officers of customs. 
31. In the aforesaid context, he submitted that having failed to advert to these 
three sections and the various notifications referred to above, this Court 
erred in placing sole reliance on Section 6 of the Act, 1962 to conclude that 
DRI officers are not officers of customs as they belong to a different 
department and require specific entrustment under Section 6 of the Act, 1962 
by the Central Government before the powers of a proper officer under 
Section 2(34) of the Act, 1962 can be assigned to them. Section 6 is 
reproduced below: 
“(6) The Central Government may, by notification in the 
Official Gazette, entrust either conditionally or 
unconditionally to any officer of the Central or the State 
Government or a local authority any functions of the 
Board or any officer of customs under this Act.” 
 
32. He submitted that the question of entrustment would arise only in relation to 
an officer of Central or State Government or Local Authority who does not 
fall within the class of officers of customs under Section 3 appointed under 
Section 4 of the Act, 1962. Some instances of the Central Government 
entrusting such functions of customs officers under Section 6 are M.F. 

(D.R.) Notification No. 161-Cus dated 22.06.1963 and M.F.(D.R.&I.) 
Notification No. 33-Cus., dated 27.04.1974 which entrusted functions of 
customs officer to police officers in a particular jurisdiction and officers of 
the Border Security Force respectively. However, in the case of DRI 
officers, they would clearly fall under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Act, 1962 
and the notifications conferring powers and duties are already on record. 
33. Our attention was also drawn to Notification 161-Cus dated 22.06.1963 
issued under Section 6 entrusting powers of search to DRI officers. As per 
Notifications GSR 214 and GSR 215 issued in the same year under Section 
4 of the Act, 1962, all officers of DRI were appointed as officers of customs. 
Therefore, an inadvertent reference to Section 6 under Notification No. 161 
dated 22.06.1963 should not lead to the drawing of any adverse inferences 
as at the highest, it may only be a case of misquoting of a Section. Secondly, 
till 11.05.2002, it was the Central Government which was the appointing 
authority under Section 4 for officers of customs as well as for entrustment 
under Section 6. It is only from 11.05.2002 that the powers under Section 4 
were delegated to the Board since Notification No. 161 dated 22.06.1963 
was issued prior to 11.05.2002 and the authority being the Central 
Government under both Sections, any incorrect reference to a provision 
would be totally inconsequential. 

34. He submitted that by virtue of the aforesaid and also without reference to 
the Notification No. 44/2011 – Cus (N.T.) dated 06.07.2011, erroneous 
conclusions came to be rendered in paragraphs 17 to 23 of the decision under 
review. The findings in Canon India (supra) in paragraphs 13 and 14 
respectively that DRI officers belong to a different department and therefore 
cannot become proper officers under Section 28, and if done so, would result 
in anarchical and unruly operation of the statute, too, is erroneous in light of 
the aforesaid submissions. 
35. He further submitted that despite being a conceded position that issuance of 
a show cause notice under Section 28 is a quasi-judicial exercise of power, 
this Court fell in error in holding the same to be an administrative review in 
paragraph 15. The Court also erred in concluding that the expression “the 
proper officer” can only signify an officer empowered to undertake 
assessment and re-assessment under Section 17, by placing unfounded 
reliance on the decision in Consolidated Coffee Ltd. and Anr. v. Coffee 
Board, Bangalore reported in as it relates to a totally 
different scenario envisaged under Article 286 read with Section 5 of the 
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. 
36. After pointing out the aforesaid aspects as errors apparent on the face of the 
record, he prayed that the present review petition be allowed. ii. 
Why the decision in Sayed Ali (supra) requires reconsideration 
37. He submitted that there are two fundamental errors in the dictum laid in 
Sayed Ali (supra) – 

Firstly, it casts an obligation that an officer of customs who is 
empowered to undertake assessment or reassessment under Section 17 
alone is qualified to become a proper officer under Section 28 for the 
purpose of raising demand of short levy, non-levy or erroneous refund. 
No other officer can be assigned the functions of the proper officer 
under Section 28. 
(ii) Secondly, the judgment was rendered in connection with officers of the 
Customs (Preventive), who were not assigned the powers and duties of 
a proper officer, and no notifications to this effect were produced or 
brought to the notice of this Court. 
38. It was pointed out by him that Sayed Ali (supra) did not deal with DRI 
officers who were indeed vested with the powers of proper officers vide the 
Circular No. 437/9/98-Cus.IV dated 15.02.1999 issued by the Board in terms 
of Section 2(34). Under Section 2(34), the power of assigning functions of 
a proper officer to an officer of customs vests with the Board or the 
Commissioner of Customs. Since the Board issued this assignment, the DRI 
officers became proper officers with effect from 15.02.1999. As a result, the 
decision rendered in Sayed Ali (supra) which was with reference to only 

Customs (Preventive) would have no application to the DRI and DGAE 
officers. The circular dated 15.02.1999 is reproduced hereinbelow: 
“F. No. 437/9/98-Cus.IV 
 
Circular No. 4/99-Cus 
Dated 15/2/1999 
 
Government of India 
Ministry of Finance 
(Department of Revenue) 
Central Board of Excise & Customs, New Delhi 
 
Subject: Issuance of Show Cause Notice by the 
Officers of directorate of Revenue Intelligence -
regarding- 
 
A doubt has been recently raised as to whether the 
Officers of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence could 
issue show cause notices in cases investigated by them 
– a practice started last year apparently in tune with the 
practice of the Directorate General of Anti Evasion. The 
matter has been examined in the Board. 
 
2. It has been observed that in terms of Customs 
Notification No. 19/90-Cus (NT.), dated 26.4.90, as 
amended from time to time, the Officers of Directorate 
of Revenue Intelligence of different categories have 
been notified and appointed as Commissioners of 
Customs, Deputy Commissioners of Customs or 
Assistant Commissioners of Customs for the are 
specified. These officers, therefore, can legally be 
entrust with discharge of functions normally performed 
by Commissioners, Deputy Commissioners or Assistant 
Commissioners of Customs in their jurisdiction, as the 
case may be. Board can no doubt subject these 
powers/functions to certain restrictions/limitations as 
may be imposed, as provided under section 5(1) of the 
Customs Act. 

3. Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Officer are, 
therefore, to undertake investigations of cases detected 
by them, and to issue the Show Cause Notices on 
completion of investigations. In line with the 
instructions issued (vide F.No. 208/23/97-CX-8, dated 
20.1.98) in respect of Officers of Directorate General 
Anti Evasion, Board has decided that in impact of cases 
investigated by the Directorate General of Revenue 
intelligence, the officers of said Directorate will be 
competent to and may issue show cause notices in cases 
investigated by them – though these will continue to be 
adjudicated 
by 
the 
concerned 
jurisdictional 
Commissioners, Additional Commissioners, Deputy 
Commissioners 
or 
Assistant 
Commissioners 
of 
Customs, as the case may be. 
 
4. The Board has also decided that these instructions 
may kindly be brought to the notice of all departmental 
officers by issuing suitable standing orders.

39. As regards the observations in Sayed Ali (supra) on the inter se link between 
Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 respectively, he submitted that no such 
mandate flows from either of the two sections and reading any such linkage 
into the scheme of the Act, 1962 would directly undermine the powers of 
search, seizure and investigation of the DRI officers under the Act, 1962 
along with the assignment of functions as proper officers to issue show cause 
notices post such search and investigation. Although no disability is to be 
found in any provisions of the Act, 1962, yet Sayed Ali (supra) creates such 
an embargo and also proceeds to hold that empowering such officers to issue 

show cause notices would result in multiple persons dealing with the same 
issue leading to utter chaos and confusion. He submitted that the Board has 
been issuing circulars and notifications from time to time with a view to 
ensure that no such overlap occurs. He also argued that the respondents have 
not adduced any evidence or empirical statistics to even remotely indicate 
that an importer has been visited with either multiple show cause notices or 
adjudication orders on the same subject. 
40. He further submitted that the Board had vested DRI with the power to issue 
only show cause notices and the adjudication orders in furtherance of the 
show cause notices were to be passed by the respective port officers. In cases 
involving multiple ports, common adjudicators were assigned powers by the 
Board and later also by the DRI and these adjudicators never involved 
themselves either in the investigation of the case or in the issuance of show 
cause notices. In such circumstances, he submitted that both the findings in 
Sayed Ali (supra) require reconsideration. 
41. He further drew our attention to Circular No. 18/2015 – Customs dated 
09.06.2015 issued by the Board pertaining to the appointment of common 
adjudicating authority and the mode and manner of assignment of functions 
for adjudication with a view to avoid multiplicity or plurality. The same is 
extracted below:

Sir / Madam, 
Subject: Appointment of common adjudicating 
authority -regarding 
Reference is invited to Notification No 60/2015-
Customs (N.T.), dated 04.06.2015 whereby the power to 
appoint common adjudicating authority in cases 
investigated by DRI upto the level of Commissioner of 
Customs has been delegated to Principal Director 
General of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence in terms 
of section 152 of the Customs Act, 1962. This 
notification was issued in the interest of expediting 
decision making with resultant benefits to both trade 
and revenue in terms of faster settlement of outstanding 
disputes. These appointments were done hitherto by the 
Central Board of Excise and Customs under sections 4 
and 5 of the Customs Act 1962. 
2. In the light of the aforementioned notification, all 
cases of appointment of common adjudicating authority 
in respect of cases investigated by DRI will be handled 
by Principal DG, DRI. In this regard, the Board has 
prescribed the following guidelines for Principal DG, 
DRI: 
(a) The following cases initiated by DRI shall be 
assigned to Additional Director General (Adjudication), 
DRI: 
(i) Cases involving duty of Rs.5 crores and above; 

(ii) Group of cases on identical issues involving 
aggregate duty of Rs.5 crores or more; 
(iii) Cases involving seizure value of Rs.5 crores or 
more; 
(iv) Cases of over-valuation irrespective of value 
involved; and 
(v) Existing DRI cases with erstwhile Commissioner 
(Adjudication). 
(b) Cases other than at (a) above involving more than 
one Customs Commissionerate would be assigned to the 
jurisdictional Commissioner of Customs on the basis of 
the maximum duty evaded; 
(c) Cases other than at (a) above involving a single 
Customs Commissionerate would be assigned to the 
jurisdictional Commissioner of Customs; 

Non-DRI 
cases 
pending 
with 
erstwhile 
Commissioner (Adjudication) would be assigned to 
Additional Director General (Adjudication), DRI; 
(e) Past DRI cases pending for adjudication with 
jurisdictional Commissioners of Customs would 
continue with these officers; 
(f) Remand cases would be decided by the original 
adjudicating authority. 
3. All other cases of appointment of common 
adjudicator i.e. other than the cases mentioned in 
paragraph 2 above would continue to be dealt by the 
Board. 
This 
would 
include 
cases 
made 
by 
Commissionerates or cases made by DRI wherein the 
adjudicating officer is an officer below the level of 
Additional Director General (Adjudication), DRI. 
4. Board has also decided that all the pending cases 
where common adjudicating authorities have not been 
appointed so far or where the common adjudicating 
authorities have been appointed but adjudications have 
not been done should be disposed of expeditiously in 
terms of aforementioned guidelines. However, while 
doing so in regard to the latter category of cases, 
Principal DG, DRI will take into consideration the fact 
whether or not personal hearings have taken place and 
the stage of passing the adjudication order. This is to 
ensure that cases about to be finalized are not 
reallocated to another adjudicating authority thereby 

defeating the objective of expediting the finalization of 
disputes. 
5. Difficulty faced, if any, may be brought to the notice 
of the Board at an early date. 
Yours faithfully 
(Pawan Khetan) 
OSD (Customs IV)” 
42. He also brought to our notice similar notifications and circulars issued 
subsequently to plead that all steps have been taken with a view to ensure 
that there is no overlap of jurisdiction. In the absence of any evidence or 
proof adduced by the importer, the dictum as laid in Sayed Ali (supra) 
declaring that this would result in utter chaos and confusion and only such 
officers vested with the power of assessment and re-assessment can issue 
notices under Section 28, requires reconsideration. iii. 
The decision in Mangali Impex (supra) is liable to be set aside and the 
decision in Sunil Gupta (supra) ought to be affirmed 
43. He submitted that the decision in Mangali Impex (supra) too observed that 
the assignment of powers to DRI officers for issuing show cause notices 
under Section 28 of the Act, 1962 would create a situation of utter confusion 
and chaos and declared Section 28(11) of the Act, 1962 to be 
unconstitutional for being violative of Article 14 owing to its inherent 
arbitrariness. The decision also directed the Department to issue suitable 
instructions and ensure avoidance of multiplicity or plurality of proceedings. 
He submitted that the instructions have been scrupulously followed and 

complied with since 1999 through various notifications and Board circulars, 
thereby avoiding any overlap. He submitted that it was because of this 
reason that the importers were not able to produce any material to support 
such adverse inferences. Thus, he submitted that the decision in Mangali 
Impex (supra) also deserved to be set aside. 
44. On the correctness of the decision in Mangali Impex (supra), he further 
submitted that the reasoning in the decision i.e., the Validation Act, 2011 
does not extend its non-obstante clause to anything contained elsewhere in 
the same statute or in any other law for the time being in force, is incorrect 
and not legally unsustainable. On the finding of the High Court that since 
Explanation 2 remains on the statute even after the insertion of Section 
28(11), it places an embargo for the period prior to 08.04.2011, for the 
application of Section 28(11). The Ld. ASG submitted that Explanation 2, 
in no way, had interfered or can interfere with the validating power 
introduced vide Section 28(11). He delineated the sequence of events 
leading to the insertion of Section 28(11) in the Act, 1962 to make good his 
submission. 

This Court delivered the judgment in Sayed Ali (supra) on 18.02.2011. 
(ii) Parliament vide the Finance Act, 2011 introduced certain amendments 
to Section 28 on 08.04.2011. 

(iii) On 06.07.2011, the Central Government issued Notification 44/2011 
assigning the functions of proper officers to officers of Customs 
(Preventive), DRI, DGAE and officers of Commissioner of Central 
Excise. The same is extracted below:

the Customs (Amendment And Validation) Bill, 2011 
 
“(11) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in any judgment, decree or order of any court 
of law, tribunal or other authority, all persons 
appointed as officers of Customs under sub-section (1) 
of section 4 before the 6th day of July, 2011 shall be 
deemed to have and always had the power of assessment 
under section 17 and shall be deemed to have been and 
always had been the proper officers for the purposes of 
this section.” 

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 
The Customs Act, 1962 consolidates and amends the law 
relating to customs. Clause (34) of section 2 of the said 
Act defines the expression “proper officer” in relation to 
the functions under the said Act to mean the officer of 
customs who is assigned those functions by the Central 
Board of Excise and Customs or the Commissioner of 
Customs. Recently, a question has arisen as to whether 
the Commissioner of Customs (Preventive) is competent 
to exercise and discharge the powers of a proper officer 
for issue of a notice for the demand of duty. The Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of India in Commissioner of Customs 
versus Sayed Ali and Anr. (Civil Appeal Nos. 4294-4295 
of 2002) held that only a customs officer who has been 
specifically assigned the duties of assessment and re-
assessment in the jurisdiction area is competent to issue 
a notice for the demand of duty as a proper officer. As 
such the Commissioner of Customs (Preventive) who has 
not been assigned the function of a “proper officer” for 
the purposes of assessment or re-assessment of duty and 
issue of show cause Notice to demand Customs duty 
under Section 17 read with Section 28 of the Act in 
respect of goods entered for home consumption is not 
competent to function as a proper officer which has not 
been the legislative intent. 
 
2. In view of the above the Show Cause Notices issued 
over the time by the Customs officers such as those of the 
Commissionerates of Customs (Preventive), Directorate 
General of Revenue Intelligence and others, who were 
not specifically assigned the functions of assessment and 
re-assessment of customs duty may be construed as 
invalid. The result would be huge loss of revenue to the 
exchequer and disruption in the revenue already 
mobilized in cases already adjudicated. However, 
having regard to the urgency of the matter, the 
Government issued notification on 6th July, 2011 
specifically declaring certain officers as proper officers 
for the aforesaid purposes. 

3. In the circumstances, it has become necessary to 
clarify the true legislative intent that Show Cause 
Notices issued by Customs officers, i.e., officers of the 
Commissionerates of Customs (Preventive), Directorate 
General of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Directorate 
General of Central Excise Intelligence (DGCEI) and 
Central Excise Commissionerates for demanding 
customs duty not levied or short levied or erroneously 
refunded in respect of goods imported are valid, 
irrespective of the fact that any specific assignment as 
proper officer was issued or not. It is, therefore, 
purposed 
to 
amend 
the 
Customs 
Act, 

retrospectively and to validate anything done or any 
action taken under the said Act in pursuance of the 
provisions of the said Act at all material times 
irrespective of issuance of any specific assignment on 6th 
July, 2011. 
 
4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.” 
 
(v) Finally, the Validation Act came to be passed on 16.09.2011 and Sub-
Section (11) became part of Section 28. 
45. He contended that Explanation 2 and the introduction of Section 28(11) are 
for distinct purposes and are not connected to each other in any way. Prior 
to 08.04.2011, the period of limitation available under the statute for 
demanding short levy, non-levy or erroneous refund was six months. 
Whereas after 08.04.2011, it was enhanced to one year. As the amendment 
substituted the then-existing Section 28, it provided a saving provision to 
protect the notices issued prior to 08.04.2011 from the extension of 
limitation period from 6 months to one year. He submitted that the purport 
of Explanation 2 was only to ensure that those rights envisaged under old 

Section 28 stand preserved. Explanation 2 did not deal with the jurisdictional 
exercise of the power of DRI officers in issuing show cause notices under 
Section 28, whereas, the Validation Act, 2011, introducing Section 28(11) 
addressed precisely only that issue. 
46. He submitted that the conclusion drawn in Mangali Impex (supra) was 
legally incorrect for holding that Section 28(11) is overbroad in assuming 
every officer of customs to be deemed as proper officers both for Sections 
17 and 28. The Validation Act, 2011, was enacted to regularize only past 
actions and not future actions, which are governed by Notification No. 
44/2011 dated 06.07.2011 which even according to the High Court is valid 
and proper. Consequently, the validation has a very limited role to play as it 
travels back only to empower such of those officers of customs who had 
issued show cause notices in the past and vesting them also with the power 
under Section 17. 
47. He submitted that the decision in Sunil Gupta (supra) clarifies the correct 
legal position and should be held to be so by this Court. iv. 
Changes introduced by the Finance Act, 2022 are in the nature of 
surplusage 
48. Lastly, he referred to the amendments brought about by the Finance Act, 
2022, vide Sections 86, 87, 88, 94 and 97. The same are extracted below: 
Section 86 - Amendment of section 2 of the Act, 1962

“88. In section 5 of the Customs Act,-- 
(a) after sub-section (1), the following sub-sections shall 
be inserted, namely:-- 
"(1A) Without prejudice to the provisions contained in

Section 94 - Insertion of new section 110AA to the 
Act, 1962 
“94. After section 110A of the Customs Act, the 
following section shall be inserted, namely:-- 
110AA. Action subsequent to inquiry, investigation or

“Where in pursuance of any proceeding, in accordance 
with Chapter XIIA or this Chapter, if an officer of 
customs has reasons to believe that-- 
(a) any duty has been short-levied, not levied, short-paid 
or not paid in a case where assessment has already been 
made; 
(b) any duty has been erroneously refunded; 
(c) any drawback has been erroneously allowed; or 
(d) any interest has been short-levied, not levied, short-
paid or not paid, or erroneously refunded, then such 
officer of customs shall, after causing inquiry, 
investigation, or as the case may be, audit, transfer the 
relevant documents, along with a report in writing. 

(i) to the proper officer having jurisdiction, as assigned 
under section 5 in respect of assessment of such duty, or 
to the officer who allowed such refund or drawback; or 
(ii) in case of multiple jurisdictions, to an officer of 
customs to whom such matter is assigned by the Board, 
in exercise of the powers conferred under section 5, and 
thereupon, power exercisable under sections 28, 28AAA 
or Chapter X, shall be exercised by such proper officer 
or by an officer to whom the proper officer is 
subordinate in accordance with sub-section (2) of 
section 5.” 
 
Section 97 - Validation of certain actions taken under 
the Act, 1962 
“97. Notwithstanding anything contained in any 
judgment, decree or order of any court, tribunal, or 
other authority, or in the provisions of the Customs Act, 
1962 (52 of 1962), (hereinafter referred to as the 
Customs Act):- 
(i) anything done or any duty performed or any action 
taken or purported to have been taken or done under 
Chapters V, VAA, VI, IX, X, XI, XII, XIIA, XIII, XIV, XVI 
and XVII of the Customs Act, as it stood prior to its 
amendment by this Act, shall be deemed to have been 
validly done or performed or taken;

of the Customs Act, as amended by this Act, shall have 
and shall always be deemed to have effect for all 
purposes as if the provisions of the Customs Act, as 
amended by this Act, had been in force at all material 
times. 
Explanation. -- For the purposes of this section, it is 
hereby clarified that any proceeding any 
action taken under this section and pending on the date 
of commencement of this Act shall be disposed of in 
accordance with the provisions of the Customs Act, as 
amended by this Act.” 

49. He submitted that the amendments carried out in the Act, 1962 vide Sections 
87 and 88 of the Finance Act, 2022 respectively are a mere surplusage done 
ex abundanti cautela and are clarificatory in nature. He further submitted 
that Section 3 deals with classes of officers and officers of the same rank 
will constitute the same class. The amended Section 5 only expands the very 
same class with designation and functions and nothing more. 
50. He submitted that Section 94 of the Finance Act, 2022 introducing Section 
110AA to the Act, 1962 is only a way forward for the future wherein post 
search and investigation by the DRI, certain category of cases have now been 
directed to be handed over to the port authorities for issuing necessary show 
cause notices and this, in no way, can vitiate notices issued by DRI earlier 
especially in the absence of a constitutional or statutory embargo. 
51. Finally, he submitted that a provision of law should appear arbitrary or 
abusive to be declared illegal or unconstitutional or invalid. A possible 
misuse of the provision by the authorities or a perceived misuse or mere 
presumptions and conjectures of a possible misuse cannot constitute basis to 
hold that a provision is arbitrary and violative of Article 14. He relied on the 
following decisions to fortify his submission: 
a. 
Collector of Customs v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty, 1962 SCC 
OnLine SC 30 
b. 
Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, (2015) 

c. 
Commissioner of Customs v. Dilip Kumar & Co., (2018) 
d. 
Goodyear India Ltd. v. State of Haryana, (1990) 
C. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

52. Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, Mr. Arvind Datar and Mr. V. Lakshmikumaran, learned 
Senior Counsel appeared on behalf of the various importers and vehemently 
objected to the review of Canon India (supra) and also contended that both 
Sayed Ali (supra) and Mangali Impex (supra) are correct in their 
conclusions and need no interference. 
53. 
Mr. Mukul Rohatgi contended that the power of review is extremely 
circumscribed and limited. It is not a means to provide a second innings to 
anyone. The Department in the guise of a review is seeking to re-argue the 
whole matter. Even if a different view is possible, the same cannot give 
rise to a review. He relied on the following decisions: 

Col. Avtar Singh Sekhon v. Union of India, (1980) Supp SCC 562 
(ii) Lily Thomas Vs Union of India, (2000) 
(iii) Champsey Bhara & Co. v. Jivraj Balloo Spinning and Weaving Co. 
Ltd., (1923) SCC OnLine PC 10 
(iv) State of Telangana v. Mohd. Abdul Qasim, (2024). 

54. Mr. Arvind Datar too submitted that the scope of review is extremely limited 
and further contended that Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022 is a clear 
overreach and needs to be considered separately. 
55. Mr. V. Lakshmikumaran made the following submissions: 

The scheme of the Act, 1962 clearly indicates that Sections 17, 46, 
47 and 28 of the Act, 1962 respectively are interlinked to and inter-
dependent on each other. These provisions involve a sequential flow 
of events to be processed by a single officer, and therefore, 
empowering DRI officers who are not connected to this scheme, is 
illegal. 

Section 17 deals with assessment and reassessment. Section 46 
obligates filing of bills of entries. Section 47 allows clearance of 
goods for home consumption post the assessment under Section 17 
and Section 28 pertains to demand of duty in the nature of short levy, 
short paid and erroneously refunded. Since all these statutory action 
points are interrelated, it is the same proper officer who should be 
empowered to perform all of these four functions and the same 
cannot be assigned to different sets of officers. 

The amendment to Section 17 in 2011 allowing self-assessment is 
inconsequential since the power to assess and reassess and allow 
clearances is still with the officer of customs. 

On the issue of whether there are any statutory limitations to the 
assignment of powers under Section 28 only to those officers who 
do assessment or re-assessment under Section 17, he submitted that 
the scheme of the Act, 1962 as explained in Sayed Ali (supra) and 
Mangali Impex (supra), clearly indicates that Sections 17 and 28 of 
the Act, 1962 respectively are interconnected and interdependent. 

Canon India (supra) is correct in holding that DRI officers should 
be entrusted with the functions under Section 6 of the Act, 1962. 
Since the Central Government has not done so, they cannot be 
assigned the functions of proper officer. 

Section 5 of the Act, 1962 deals only with powers and duties but not 
the functions, whereas, Section 6 deals with functions and thus, a 
notification under Section 6 is necessary. He emphasised on the 
different consequences arising from the use of the words “powers” 
and “duties” in Section 5 and use of the word “functions” in Section 
6. 

It was contended that Section 28 deals with short levy, non-levy and 
erroneous refund. Levy means determination of duty through a 
process of assessment/reassessment. Section 28 therefore involves 
rendering a finding that the earlier assessment was not correct. 
Section 28 is intended to revise or upset the original assessment done 

under Section 17 and once an order gets passed under Section 28, the 
original assessment would not survive and therefore, the same 
officer can issue the show cause notice. 
(viii) The Board’s Circular dated 15.02.1999 cannot come to the rescue of 
the Department because there was no assignment of function of 
assessment/reassessment as required by Sayed Ali (supra). 
According to the learned counsel, both Notification No. 44/2011 
dated 06.07.2011 and Section 28(11) were brought to the notice of 
this Court in Canon India (supra). 

Having accepted the principles laid down in Sayed Ali (supra) on the 
interlinkage between Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 
respectively, both vide Section 28(11) and Notification No. 44/2011 
dated 06.07.2011, it is not open to the Department to now contend 
the contrary as reaffirmed in Canon India (supra). 

All proper officers are officers of customs, but all officers of customs 
are not proper officers. Mere conferment of power or assignment of 
functions of assessment/reassessment under Sections 17 and 28 of 
the Act, 1962 respectively is not enough. Out of the various proper 
officers who have been empowered under Sections 17 and 28, only 
that proper officer who had actually carried out the assessment will 
be the proper officer. There can be concurrent conferment of power 

but there cannot be concurrent exercise of powers as the same may 
result in chaos and utter confusion. 

The decision rendered by the High Court in Mangali Impex (supra) 
is correct and need not be disturbed for the following reasons: 
a. 
Section 28(11) does not validate the show cause notices issued 
by various officers. It merely deems all officers who were 
appointed as officers of customs under Section 4(1) to have 
always had the powers under Sections 17 and 28 the Act, 1962 
respectively. This would not automatically revive the show 
cause notices issued by such officers of customs. b. 
In order to hold that Section 28(11) validates past actions, this 
Court will have to insert words in the statute, that too in a taxing 
statute which imposes liabilities on assesses, that too 
retrospectively. c. 
Several unintended consequences may arise if it is held that 
show cause notices issued by other officers of customs will be 
revived. There are instances wherein many show cause notices 
have been issued after the Sayed Ali (supra) judgment by the 
jurisdictional commissionerate wherever the limitation period 
permitted for demands to be made. In those cases, assessees will 
be faced with two show cause notices. He laid emphasis on the 

need to take an undertaking from the Department to avoid such 
a situation if it were to arise. d. 
The High Court has correctly held that Section 28(11) 
perpetrates the very chaos that the judgment in Sayed Ali 
(supra) sought to prevent. e. 
Explanation 2 to Section 28 should be given a plain meaning. It 
was in the statute before Section 28(11) was introduced, hence 
the framers of the statute were well aware of the implications 
of the Explanation 2. f. 
On 08.4.2011, Section 28 of the Act, 1962 underwent a drastic 
change and not just a mere change in terms of time period being 
changed from six months to one year. The mode & manner of 
issuing the show cause notice, the manner of adjudication and 
payment of duty, etc. have been amended making it more 
beneficial to the assessee. That is the reason why the old notices 
were to be dealt with under the old Section. g. 
It is impossible to read Section 28(11) and Explanation 2 
together as validating any action prior to 08.04.2011. Such is 
the plain meaning and only such an interpretation is warranted 
in the present case. 

Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022 is liable to be struck down as 
manifestly arbitrary and thus violative of Article 14. According to 
him, the Finance Act, 2022 does not cure the defects pointed out by 
this Court in its decision rendered in Canon India (supra) for the 
following reasons: 
a. 
The amendments introduced vide the Finance Act, 2022 
continue to violate the principles laid down in the judgment of 
this Court in Sayed Ali (supra) wherein it was held that granting 
jurisdiction to multiple officers will create utter chaos and 
confusion. He highlighted that the review filed against the 
decision in Sayed Ali (supra) has already been dismissed. b. 
The validation of past actions by way of Section 97(i) of the 
Finance Act, 2022 violates the principles enshrined in the 
judgment of Canon India (supra) since it will lead to a very 
anarchical and unruly operation of a statute which was sought 
to be avoided in Canon India (supra). c. 
A Validation Act can only validate the law but cannot validate 
a fact. Once a particular officer has exercised the function of 
assessment, it is a jurisdictional fact that has occurred to the 
exclusion of all other groups in the Customs Department. 
Thereafter, only that officer or his superiors (known as the 

Customs group) who had undertaken assessment under Section 
17 in the first place shall have the jurisdiction to issue notices 
for recovery of duty under Section 28. d. 
This Court in its judgment in Canon India (supra) found that 
factually the assessments were initially not undertaken by 
officers of DRI and such a defect cannot be cured 
retrospectively by a validating law. Therefore, the present 
amendments seek to validate and effectively change a judicially 
determined fact, which cannot be done by a legislation. 
(xiii) The Finance Act, 2022 also introduced a provision, i.e. Section 
110AA, providing a mechanism for actions to be taken subsequent 
to inquiry, investigation or audit by any officer of customs. Section 
110AA operates only prospectively. This provision is Parliament’s 
recognition of the importance of maintaining the jurisdiction for 
issuing show cause notices within the assessing group. 

Further, by retrospectively modifying the scheme of appointment 
and assignment of functions to officers of customs, a larger lacuna 
has been created as there exist no valid notifications for assignment 
of functions of a ‘proper officer’ under Section 5 for the period prior 
to 01.04.2022. Thus, all actions performed by any officer of Customs 
prior to 01.04.2022 have in fact been performed without jurisdiction. 

In such circumstances referred to above, it was prayed that there 
being no merit in the Review Petition filed by the Department, the 
same may be dismissed. 

D. ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION 

56. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone 
through the materials on record, the following questions fall for our 
consideration: 

Whether there is an “error apparent on the face of the record” for the 
purpose of entertaining the review petition? 
(ii) If the answer to the aforesaid question is in the affirmative, then 
whether the exposition of law propounded by this Court in Canon 
India (supra) as regards the power of the DRI to issue show cause 
notices could be said to be the correct statement of law? 
This would entail addressal of the following questions: 
a. 
Whether officers of DRI are the proper officers for the purposes 
of Section 28 of the Act, 1962? b. 
What would be the extent, scope and domain of Section 6 of the 
Act, 1962 vis-à-vis Section 2(34), Section 3, Section 4 and Section 
5 of the Act, 1962 and whether an entrustment by the Central 
Government under Section 6 of the Act, 1962 is mandatory to 
empower the Officers of the DRI for the purpose of issuing show 
cause notices? c. 
Whether the power under Section 28 can be exercised only by 
someone who is empowered to exercise the power under Section 

17 of the Act, 1962 for the goods in question? In other words, how 
best the meaning of the expression “proper officer” should be 
construed for the purposes of exercise of functions under Section 
28? d. 
Whether “the proper officer” in Section 28 must necessarily be the 
same proper officer referred to under Section 17 of the Act, 1962? 
If no, whether the use of the definite article “the” in the expression 
“the proper officer” in Section 28 is in the context of that proper 
officer who has been assigned the powers of discharging the 
functions under Section 28 by virtue of powers conferred under 
Section 5 of the Act, 1962? e. 
Whether issuance of show cause notices followed by adjudication 
under Section 28 of the Act, 1962 is an administrative review as 
held in Canon India (supra) or a quasi-judicial exercise of power 
under administrative law? 
(iii) Whether the introduction of Section 28(11) vide the Validation Act of 
2011 which retrospectively validates the show cause notices issued 
under Section 28 with effect from 06.07.2011, is discriminatory and 
arbitrary for not curing the defect highlighted in Sayed Ali (supra) and, 
therefore, is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India? 

(iv) Whether the judgment delivered by the High Court of Delhi in the case 
of Mangali Impex (supra) expounds the correct interpretation of 
Section 28(11)? 
(v) Whether Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022, which retrospectively 
validates the show cause notices with effect from 01.04.2023, is 
manifestly arbitrary and therefore, violative of Article 14 of the 
Constitution of India? 
E. ANALYSIS 
 
i. 
Review jurisdiction 
 
57. Article 137 of the Constitution of India provides for review of judgments or 
orders by the Supreme Court. It reads as under: 
“137. Review of judgments or orders by the Supreme 
Court. — Subject to the provisions of any law made by 
Parliament or any rules made under Article 145, the 
Supreme Court shall have power to review any judgment 
pronounced or order made by it.” 
 
58. Further, Part IV Order XLVII of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013 deals with 
the review and consists of five rules. Rule 1 is relevant for our purposes. It 
reads as under: 
“1. The Court may review its judgment or order, but no 
application for review will be entertained in a civil 
proceeding except on the ground mentioned in Order 47 
Rule 1 of the Code and in a criminal proceeding except 

on the ground of an error apparent on the face of the 
record.” 
 
59. Order XLVII Rule 1(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 provides for 
an application for review which reads as under: 
“1. Application for review of judgment. — Any person 
considering himself aggrieved— 
(a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is 
allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred, 
(b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is 
allowed, or 
(c) by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small 
Causes, and who, from the discovery of new and 
important matter or evidence which, after the exercise 
of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could 
not be produced by him at the time when the decree was 
passed or order made, or on account of some mistake or 
error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other 
sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the 
decree passed or order made against him, may apply for 
a review of judgment to the court which passed the 
decree or made the order.” 
 
60. Thus, in view of the above, the following grounds of review are maintainable 
as stipulated by the statute: 

Discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the 
exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of the 

petitioner or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree 
was passed or order made; 
(ii) Mistake or error apparent on the face of the record; or 
(iii) Any other sufficient reason. 
61. The words “any other sufficient reason” have been interpreted by the Privy 
Council in the case of Chhajju Ram v. Neki reported in and approved by this Court in Moran Mar Basselios 
Catholicos v. Mar Poulose Athanasius reported in to mean a reason sufficient on grounds, at least analogous to those 
specified in the rule. 
62. In the case of Tinkari Sen v. Dulal Chandra Das reported in 1966 SCC 
OnLine Cal 103, the Calcutta High Court held that if the court overlooks or 
fails to consider a legal provision that grants it the authority to act in a 
specific manner, this may amount to an error analogous to one apparent on 
the face of the record. Such an oversight would fall within the scope of Order 
XLVII, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 which allows for 
reviews. Relevant parts are extracted below: 
“18. Consider, in this context, Sir Hari Sankar 
Pal v. Anath Nath Mitter, AIR 1949 FC 106. Mr. 
Chittatosh Mookerjee refers me to Mukherjee, J. (as his 
Lordship then was), observed, Kania C.J. Fazl Ali, 
Patanjali Sastri and Mahajan, JJ. (as their Lordships 
then were) agreeing: 
“That a decision is erroneous in law is certainly no 
ground for ordering review. If the Court has decided a 

point and decided it erroneously, the error could not be 
one apparent on the face of the record or even 
analogous to it “When, however, the Court disposes of 
a case without adverting to or applying its mind to a 
provision of law which gives it jurisdiction to act in a 
particular way that may amount to an error analogous 
to one apparent on the face of the record sufficient to 
bring the case within the purview of Order 47, rule 1 
of the CPC.”

63. In Girdhari Lal Gupta v. D. H. Mehta reported in (1971), this 
Court allowed the review on the ground that its attention was not given to a 
particular provision of the statute. The relevant observations read as follows: 
“15. The learned counsel for the respondent State 
urges that this is not a case fit for review because it is 
only a case of mistaken judgment. But we are unable 
to agree with this submission because at the time of the 
arguments our attention was not drawn specifically to 
sub-section 23-C(2) and the light it throws on the 
interpretation of sub-section (1). 
16. In the result the review petition is partly allowed and 
the judgment of this Court in modified to the extent that the sentence of six 
months' rigorous imprisonment imposed on Girdharilal 
is set aside. The sentence of fine of Rs 2000 shall, 
however, stand.”

64. In M/s Northern India Caterers (India) Ltd. v. Lt. Governor of Delhi 
reported in (1980), the scope of the power of review was 
explained by this Court wherein it was held that: 

“8. It is well-settled that a party is not entitled to seek a 
review of a judgment delivered by this Court merely for 
the purpose of a rehearing and a fresh decision of the 
case. The normal principle is that a judgment 
pronounced by the Court is final, and departure from 
that principle is justified only when circumstances of a 
substantial and compelling character make it 
necessary 
to 
do 
so: Sajjan 
Singh v. State 
of 
Rajasthan [AIR 1965 SC 845: (1965), 948: 
(1965) 1 SCJ 377]. For instance, if the attention of the 
Court is not drawn to a material statutory provision 
during the original hearing, the Court will review its 
judgment: G.L. Gupta v. D.N. Mehta [(1971): 1971 SCC (Cri) 279: (1971), 750]. 
The Court may also reopen its judgment if a manifest 
wrong has been done and it is necessary to pass an 
order 
to 
do 
full 
and 
effective 
justice: O.N. 
Mohindroo v. Distt. Judge, Delhi [(1971): 
(1971), 27]. …. 
[Emphasis supplied] 
65. This Court in Yashwant Sinha v. CBI reported in (2020), has 
observed that if a relevant law has been ignored while arriving at a decision, 
it would make the decision amenable to review. The relevant observations 
read as follows: 
“78. The view of this Court, in Girdhari Lal 
Gupta [Girdhari Lal Gupta v. D.H. Mehta, (1971): 1971 SCC (Cri) 279: AIR 1971 SC 2162: 
(1971) ] as also in Deo Narain Singh [Deo 
Narain Singh v. Daddan Singh, 1986 Supp SCC 530], 
has been noticed to be that if the relevant law is ignored 
or an inapplicable law forms the foundation for the 
judgment, it would provide a ground for review. If a 
court is oblivious to the relevant statutory provisions, 
the judgment would, in fact, be per incuriam. No doubt, 
the concept of per incuriam is apposite in the context of 
its value as the precedent but as between the parties, 

certainly it would be open to urge that a judgment 
rendered, in ignorance of the applicable law, must be 
reviewed. The judgment, in such a case, becomes open 
to review as it would betray a clear error in the 
decision.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
66. In Sow Chandra Kant and Anr. v. Sheikh Habib reported in (1975), this Court held: 
“1. Mr Daphtary, learned counsel for the petitioners, 
has argued at length all the points which were urged at 
the earlier stage when we refused special leave thus 
making out that a review proceeding virtually amounts 
to a re-hearing. May be, we were not right is refusing 
special leave in the first round; but, once an order has 
been passed by this Court, a review thereof must be 
subject to the rules of the game and cannot be lightly 
entertained. A review of a judgment is a serious step 
and reluctant resort to it is proper only where a glaring 
omission or patent mistake or like grave error has crept 
in earlier by judicial fallibility. A mere repetition, 
through different counsel, of old and overruled 
arguments, a second trip over ineffectually covered 
ground or minor mistakes of inconsequential import are 
obviously insufficient. The very strict need for 
compliance with these factors is the rationale behind the 
insistence of counsel's certificate which should not be a 
routine affair or a habitual step. It is neither fairness to 
the Court which decided nor awareness of the precious 
public time lost what with a huge backlog of dockets 
waiting in the queue for disposal, for counsel to issue 
easy certificates for entertainment of review and fight 
over again the same battle which has been fought and 
lost. The Bench and the Bar, we are sure, are jointly 
concerned in the conservation of judicial time for 
maximum use. We regret to say that this case is typical 
of the unfortunate but frequent phenomenon of repeat 
performance with the review label as passport. Nothing 
which we did not hear then has been heard now, except 

a couple of rulings on points earlier put forward. May 
be, as counsel now urges and then pressed, our order 
refusing special leave was capable of a different course. 
The present stage is not a virgin ground but review of 
an earlier order which has the normal feature of 
finality.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
67. Thus, the decisions referred to above make it abundantly clear that when a 
court disposes of a case without due regard to a provision of law or when its 
attention was not invited to a provision of law, it may amount to an error 
analogous to one apparent on the face of record sufficient to bring the case 
within the purview of Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908. In other words, if a court is oblivious to the relevant statutory 
provisions, the judgment would in fact be per incuriam. In such 
circumstances, a judgment rendered in ignorance of the applicable law must 
be reviewed. 
68. From here onwards, our endeavour is to ascertain whether the relevant 
provisions of law including the notifications issued by the Board from time 
to time were brought to the notice of the Court while deciding Canon India 
(supra). 
69. A three-Judge Bench in Canon India (supra) examined whether officers of 
the DRI are proper officers for the purpose of issuing recovery notices under 
the provisions of Section 28 of the Act, 1962. 
70. The Court while deciding the aforesaid question held as under: 

“11. There are only two articles “a (or an)” and “the”. 
“A (or an)” is known as the indefinite article because it 
does not specifically refer to a particular person or 
thing. On the other hand, “the” is called the definite 
article because it points out and refers to a particular 
person or thing. There is no doubt that, if Parliament 
intended that any proper officer could have exercised 
power under Section 28(4), it could have used the word 
“any”. 
12. Parliament has employed the article “the” not 
accidently but with the intention to designate the proper 
officer who had assessed the goods at the time of 
clearance. It must be clarified that the proper officer 
need not be the very officer who cleared the goods but 
may be his successor in office or any other officer 
authorised to exercise the powers within the same office. 
In this case, anyone authorised from the Appraisal 
Group. Assessment is a term which includes 
determination of the dutiability of any goods and the 
amount of duty payable with reference to, inter alia, 
exemption or concession of customs duty vide Section 
2(2)(c) of the Customs Act, 1962 [ “2. Definitions.—In 
this Act, unless the context otherwise requires—***(2) 
“assessment” means determination of the dutiability of 
any goods and the amount of duty, tax, cess or any other 
sum so payable, if any, under this Act or under the 
Customs Tariff Act, 1975 (51 of 1975) (hereinafter 
referred to as the Customs Tariff Act) or under any other 
law for the time being in force, with reference to—(a)-
(b)***(c) exemption or concession of duty, tax, cess or 
any other sum, consequent upon any notification issued 
therefor under this Act or under the Customs Tariff Act 
or under any other law for the time being in force;”]. 
13. The nature of the power to recover the duty, not paid 
or short-paid after the goods have been assessed and 
cleared for import, is broadly a power to review the 
earlier decision of assessment. Such a power is not 
inherent in any authority. Indeed, it has been conferred 
by Section 28 and other related provisions. The power 
has been so conferred specifically on “the proper 

officer” which must necessarily mean the proper officer 
who, in the first instance, assessed and cleared the 
goods i.e. the Deputy Commissioner Appraisal Group. 
Indeed, this must be so because no fiscal statute has 
been shown to us where the power to reopen assessment 
or recover duties which have escaped assessment has 
been conferred on an officer other than the officer of the 
rank of the officer who initially took the decision to 
assess the goods. 
14. Where the statute confers the same power to perform 
an act on different officers, as in this case, the two 
officers, especially when they belong to different 
departments, cannot exercise their powers in the same 
case. Where one officer has exercised his powers of 
assessment, the power to order reassessment must also 
be exercised by the same officer or his successor and not 
by another officer of another department though he is 
designated to be an officer of the same rank. In our view, 
this would result into an anarchical and unruly 
operation of a statute which is not contemplated by any 
canon of construction of statute.” 
 
71. The aforesaid observations are in line with the decision of this Court in 
Sayed Ali (supra). However, it is relevant to note that when Sayed Ali 
(supra) was decided, Section 17 read differently and the true purport of 
Section 4 of the Act, 1962 was not considered. We shall deal with this aspect 
subsequently. 
72. The Court further held as under: 
“16. At this stage, we must also examine whether the 
Additional Director General of the DRI who issued the 
recovery notice under Section 28(4) was even a proper 
officer. The Additional Director General can be 
considered to be a proper officer only if it is shown that 

he was a Customs officer under the Customs Act. In 
addition, that he was entrusted with the functions of the 
proper officer under Section 6 of the Customs Act. The 
Additional Director General of the DRI can be 
considered to be a Customs officer only if he is shown to 
have been appointed as Customs officer under the 
Customs Act. 17. Shri Sanjay Jain, Learned Additional 
Solicitor General, relied on a Notification No. 17/2002-
Customs (N.T.), dated 7-3-2002 to show all Additional 
Directors General of the DRI have been appointed as 
Commissioners of Customs. At the relevant time, the 
Central Government was the appropriate authority to 
issue such a notification. This notification shows that all 
Additional Directors General, mentioned in Column (2), 
are appointed as Commissioners of Customs. 
18. The next step is to see whether an Additional 
Director General of the DRI who has been appointed as 
an officer of Customs, under the notification dated 7-3-
2002, has been entrusted with the functions under 
Section 28 as a proper officer under the Customs Act. In 
support of the contention that he has been so entrusted 
with the functions of a proper officer under Section 28 
of the Customs Act, Shri Sanjay Jain, Learned 
Additional Solicitor General relied on a Notification No. 
40/2012, dated 2-5-2012 issued by the Central Board of 
Excise and Customs. The notification confers various 
functions referred to in Column (3) of the notification 
under the Customs Act on officers referred to in Column 
(2). The relevant part of the notification reads as 
follows:- 
“[To be published in the Gazette of India, 
Extraordinary, Part I, Section 3, Sub-section (i)] 
Government of India 
Ministry of Finance 
(Department of Revenue) 
Notification No. 40/2012-Customs (N.T.) 

New Delhi, dated the 2nd May, 2012 
S.O. (E). - In exercise of the powers conferred by 
subsection (34) of section 2 of the Customs Act, 1962 (52 
of 1962), the Central Board of Excise and Customs, 
hereby assigns the officers and above the rank of officers 
mentioned in Column (2) of the Table below, the 
functions as the proper officers in relation to the various 
sections of the Customs Act, 1962, given in the 
corresponding entry in Column (3) of the said Table:-

and

(v) ….. 

Section 
28; ………” 
19.It appears that a Deputy Commissioner or Assistant 
Commissioner of Customs has been entrusted with the 
functions under Section 28, vide Sl. No. 3 above. By 
reason of the fact that the functions are assigned to 
officers referred to in Column (3) and those officers 
above the rank of officers mentioned in Column (2), the 
Commissioner of Customs would be included as an 
officer entitled to perform the function under Section 28 
of the Act conferred on a Deputy Commissioner or 
Assistant Commissioner but the notification appears to 
be ill-founded. The notification is purported to have 
been issued in exercise of powers under sub-section (34) 

of Section 2 of the Customs Act. This section does not 
confer any powers on any authority to entrust any 
functions to officers. The sub-Section is part of the 
definitions clause of the Act, it merely defines a proper 
officer, it reads as follows:- 
“2. Definitions. - In this Act, unless the context 
otherwise 
requires, 
- 
… 
136/163 
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.33099 of 
2015 & etc., (34) ‘proper officer’, in relation to any 
functions to be performed under this Act, means the 
officer of customs who is assigned those functions by 
the Board or the Principal Commissioner of Customs 
or Commissioner of Customs.” 
20. Section 6 is the only Section which provides for 
entrustment of functions of Customs officer on other 
officers of the Central or the State Government or local 
authority, it reads as follows:- 
“6. Entrustment of functions of Board and customs 
officers on certain other officers. - The Central 
Government may, by notification in the Official 
Gazette, 
entrust 
either 
conditionally 
or 
unconditionally to any officer of the Central or the 
State Government or a local authority any functions 
of the Board or any officer of customs under this 
Act.” 
21. If it was intended that officers of the Directorate of 
Revenue Intelligence who are officers of Central 
Government should be entrusted with functions of the 
Customs officers, it was imperative that the Central 
Government should have done so in exercise of its power 
under Section 6 of the Act. The reason why such a power 
is conferred on the Central Government is obvious and 
that is because the Central Government is the authority 
which appoints both the officers of the Directorate of 
Revenue Intelligence which is set up under the 
Notification dated 4-12-1957 issued by the Ministry of 
Finance and Customs officers who, till 11- 5-2002, were 
appointed by the Central Government. The notification 

which purports to entrust functions as proper officer 
under the Customs Act has been issued by the Central 
Board of Excise and Customs in exercise of non-existing 
power under Section 2(34) of the Customs Act. The 
notification is obviously invalid having been issued by 
an authority which had no power to do so in purported 
exercise of powers under a section which does not 
confer any such power. 
22. In the above context, it would be useful to refer to 
the decision of this Court in the case of Commissioner 
of Customs v. Sayed Ali and Another [(2011) 
= 2011 (265) E.L.T. 17 (S.C.)] wherein the proper 
officer in respect of the jurisdictional area was 
considered. The consideration made is as hereunder:- 
“16. It was submitted that in the instant case, the 
import manifest and the bill of entry were filed before 
the Additional Collector of Customs (Imports), 
Mumbai; the bill of entry was duly assessed, and the 
benefit of the exemption was extended, subject to 
execution of a bond by the importer which was duly 
executed undertaking the obligation of export. The 
Learned Counsel argued that the function of the 
preventive staff is confined to goods which are not 
manifested as in respect of manifested goods, where 
the bills of entry are to be filed, the entire function of 
assessment, clearance, etc. is carried out by the 
appraising 
officers 
functioning 
under 
the 
Commissioner of Customs (Imports). 
17. Before adverting to the rival submissions, it would 
be expedient to survey the relevant provisions of the 
Act. Section 28 of the Act, which is relevant for our 
purpose, provides for issue of notice for payment of 
duty that has not been paid, or has been short-levied 
or erroneously refunded, and provides that: 
“28. Notice for payment of duties, interest, etc. - 
(1) When any duty has not been levied or has been 
short-levied or erroneously refunded, or when 
any interest payable has not been paid, part paid 

or erroneously refunded, the proper officer may, 
- 
(a) in the case of any import made by any 
individual for his personal use or by Government 
or by any educational, research or charitable 
institution or hospital, within one year; 
(b) in any other case, within six months, from the 
relevant date, serve notice on the person 
chargeable with the duty or interest which has not 
been levied or charged or which has been so 
short-levied or part paid or to whom the refund 
has erroneously been made, requiring him to 
show cause why he should not pay the amount 
specified in the notice: 
Provided that where any duty has not been levied 
or has been short-levied or the interest has not 
been charged or has been part paid or the duty or 
interest has been erroneously refunded by reason 
of collusion or any wilful misstatement or 
suppression of facts by the importer or the 
exporter or the agent or employee of the importer 
or exporter, the provisions of this sub-section shall 
have effect as if for the words ‘one year’ and ‘six 
months’, the words ‘five years’ were substituted.” 
18. It is plain from the provision that the ‘proper 
officer’ being subjectively satisfied on the basis of 
the material that may be with him that customs 
duty has not been levied or short levied or 
erroneously refunded on an import made by any 
individual for his personal use or by the 
Government or by any educational, research or 
charitable institution or hospital, within one year 
and in all other cases within six months from the 
relevant date, may cause service of notice on the 
person chargeable, requiring him to show cause 
why he should not pay the amount specified in the 
notice. It is evident that the notice under the said 
provision has to be issued by the ‘proper officer’. 

19. Section 2(34) of the Act defines a ‘proper officer’, 
thus: 
‘2. Definitions. – 
…………………. 
(34)‘proper officer’, in relation to any functions to be 
performed under this Act, means the officer of 
customs who is assigned those functions by the Board 
or the Commissioner of Customs;’ 
It is clear from a mere look at the provision that only 
such officers of customs who have been assigned 
specific functions would be ‘proper officers’ in terms 
of Section 2(34) the Act. Specific entrustment of 
function by either the Board or the Commissioner of 
Customs is therefore, the governing test to determine 
whether an ‘officer of customs’ is the ‘proper officer’. 
20. From a conjoint reading of Sections 2(34) and 28 
of the Act, it is manifest that only such a Customs 
Officer who has been assigned the specific functions 
of assessment and reassessment of duty in the 
jurisdictional area where the import concerned has 
been affected, by either the Board or the 
Commissioner of Customs, in terms of Section 2(34) 
of the Act is competent to issue notice under section 
28 of the Act. Any other reading of Section 28 would 
render the provisions of Section 2(34) of the Act 
otiose inasmuch as the test contemplated under 
Section 2(34) of the Act is that of specific conferment 
of such functions.” 
23. We, therefore, hold that the entire proceeding in the 
present case initiated by the Additional Director 
General of the DRI by issuing show cause notices in all 
the matters before us are invalid without any authority 
of law and liable to be set aside and the ensuing 
demands are also set aside.” 

73. It is not in dispute that Canon India (supra) is based on the decision of this 
Court in Sayed Ali (supra). We say so because in Canon India (supra), the 
petitioner had not questioned the jurisdiction of the officers of DRI either 
before the departmental authorities or before the Tribunal. We must, 
therefore, first look into the judgment rendered in Sayed Ali (supra). ii. 
The decision in Commissioner of Customs v. Sayed Ali 
 
74. In Sayed Ali (supra), a show cause notice dated 28.08.1991 was issued by 
the Assistant Collector of Customs (Preventive), Mumbai, alleging a 
violation of the provisions of Section 111(d) of the Act, 1962. It culminated 
in an order dated 03.02.1993 which was appealed before the Collector of 
Customs (Appeals). An order was passed by the Collector of Customs 
(Appeals) on 14.12.1993. The Collector of Customs (Appeals) allowed the 
appeal by holding that the matter involved demand of duty beyond a period 
of six months and therefore the show cause notice could have been issued 
only by the Collector and not by the Assistant Collector of Customs 
(Preventive). At that point of time, there were circulars of the Board, which 
stipulated pecuniary limits for officers to exercise powers under various 
provisions of the Act. Thus, the Collector (Appeals) granted liberty to the 
department to re-adjudicate the case by issuing a proper show cause notice. 
75. The Collector of Customs (Preventive) thus issued a show cause notice dated 
16.04.1994, calling upon the importer to show cause as to why the goods 

seized should not be confiscated, why the customs duty amounting to 
Rs.5,07,274/- should not be levied in terms of Section 28(1) of the Act, 1962, 
by invoking the extended period of limitation, and why the penalties under 
Sections 112(a) and (b)(i) and (ii) of the Act, 1962, should not be imposed 
on the said importer. 
76. The jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs (Preventive) to issue the show 
cause notice was questioned in the reply to the show cause notice by 
referring to Notification No. 251/83 and Notification No.250/83. The 
Collector of Customs (Preventive) rejected the submission on the point of 
jurisdiction. The demand was thus affirmed by the Collector of Customs 
(Preventive) vide Order dated 19.08.1996. The matter was taken up before 
the Tribunal, which held that the Commissioner of Customs (Preventive) 
had no jurisdiction to issue the show cause notice and therefore did not have 
the jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter when the imports had taken place 
within the Bombay Customs House. 
77. This Court, after referring to Section 28 of the Act, 1962 as it stood during 
the period in dispute, concluded that from a conjoint reading of Section 
2(34) and Section 28 of the Act, 1962, it is manifest that only such a customs 
officer who has been assigned the specific functions of assessment and re-
assessment of duty in the jurisdictional area where the import concerned has 
been effected, either by the Board or the Commissioner of Customs, in terms 

of Section 2(34) of the Act, 1962, was competent to issue notice under 
Section 28 of the Act, 1962. 
78. This Court further held that “…any other reading of Section 28 would render 
the provisions of Section 2(34) of the Act otiose in as much as the test 
contemplated under Section 2(34) of the Act of the Act is that of specific 
conferment of such functions”. It further held that “Moreover, if the 
Revenue's contention that once territorial jurisdiction is conferred, the 
Collector of Customs (Preventive) becomes a "proper officer" in terms of 
Section 28 of the Act, 1962 is accepted, it would lead to a situation of utter 
chaos and confusion, in as much as all officers of customs, in a particular 
area be it under the Collectorate of Customs (Imports) or the Preventive 
Collectorate, would be "proper officers" ”. 
79. This Court concluded that “It is only the officers of customs, who are 
assigned the functions of assessment, which of course, would include re- 
assessment, working under the jurisdictional Collectorate within whose 
jurisdiction the bills of entry or baggage declarations had been filed and the 
consignments had been cleared for home consumption, will have the 
jurisdiction to issue notice under Section 28 of the Act”. Thus, the 
proceedings impugned therein were set aside. 

80. Thereafter, a Review Petition was filed by the Department in the aforesaid 
case. This Court dismissed the Review Petition on the ground of delay in 
filing the review. 
81. ⁠The decision in Sayed Ali (supra) proceeds on the assumption that for the 
"proper officer" to exercise the functions under Section 28 of the Act, 1962, 
such officer must necessarily possess the power of assessment and 
reassessment under Section 17. However, a plain reading of Sections 17 and 
28 of the Act, 1962 does not bring out any such inter-dependence between 
the two provisions. Having looked into the statutory scheme of the Act, 
1962, we are of the view that the observations pertaining to the interlinkage 
between Sections 17 and 28 respectively of the Act, 1962 made in Sayed Ali 
(supra) do not lay down the correct position of law. 
82. Even otherwise, the decision in Sayed Ali (supra) could have been arrived 
at without deciding on the interdependence of Section 17 and Section 28 of 
the Act, 1962 as the Customs (Preventive) officers, whose jurisdiction to 
issue show cause notices was under challenge in that case, were not assigned 
the functions of the "proper officer" for the purposes of Section 28 through 
a notification issued by the appropriate authority. As we have observed in 
the foregoing parts of this judgment, assignment of functions is a mandatory 
requirement for the exercise of jurisdiction by the "proper officer". The 
observations made in Sayed Ali (supra) on the connection between Sections 

17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 are obiter dicta at best and do not constitute the 
binding ratio decidendi of that judgment. 
83. Further, Sayed Ali (supra) could not have been relied upon by this Court in 
Canon India (supra) as it could not have been applied for the period 
subsequent to 08.04.2011 in view of the fact that Section 17 of the Act, 1962 
has undergone a radical change by virtue of the amendments made by the 
Finance Act, 2011. iii. 
Changes to Section 17 w.e.f. 11.04.2011 – the assessment of bill(s) of 
entry and shipping bill(s) 
 
84. Section 17 of the Act, 1962 was amended by Section 38 of the Finance Act, 
2011 with effect from 08.04.2011. The amendment altered the method of 
assessment of bill(s) of entry and shipping bill(s). This change appears not 
to have been brought to the notice of this Court while Canon India (supra) 
was heard. 
85. We note that with effect from 08.04.2011, the functions of the proper officer 
under Section 17 also underwent certain changes. One such change is that 
the assessment of bill(s) of entry and shipping bill(s) was no longer the task 
of the “proper officer”. With effect from 08.04.2011, Bill(s) of Entry and/or 
Shipping Bill(s) are self-assessed. This self-assessment is to be accepted or 
rejected by the proper officer subject to verification in certain cases. 

86. The “proper officer” appointed for the purpose of Section 17 of the Act, 
1962 under a notification issued under Section 2(34) of the Act, 1962 could 
only make a re-assessment of the bill(s) of entry and shipping bill(s) in case 
they did not agree with the self-assessment of the importer or the exporter 
as the case may be. 
87. The purport of Section 17 as it stood before 08.04.2011 and after 08.04.2011 
was analysed by a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court in the case 
of M/s. N.C. Alexander v. The Commissioner of Customs, Chennai in W.P. 
Nos. 33099 of 2015. The relevant paragraphs of the judgment are

“207. Thus, there was a paradigm shift in the method of 
assessment with effect from 08.04.2011. Till 07.4.2011, 
the assessment of Bill of Entry(s) or the Shipping Bill(s) 
was by a “proper officer” appointed for that purpose 
under Section 2(34) of the Custom Act, 1962. The 
assessment was left to the Group 'B' Gazetted Officers 
and it is only such officers were appointed as “proper 
officers” for assessment under Section 17. 
208. However, after 08.04.2011, Bill(s) of Entry (in the 
case of import) or Shipping Bill(s) (in the case of export) 
are to be self assessed by an importer or an exporter 
under Sections 46 and 50 of the Customs Act, 1962 
respectively. The changes are shown in bold in the 
above Table. 
209. A “proper officer” has to merely verify the entries 
made in the Bill(s) of Entry under Section 46 (in case of 
import) or Shipping Bill(s) under Section 50 (in case of 
export). The “Proper Officer” may examine or test 
imported goods or export goods or such part thereof as 

may be necessary. If required, such an officer can only 
re-assess the goods under Section 17 of the Act. Thus, 
a “Proper Officer” under Section 17(1) & 17(4) of the 
Act is merely required to re-assess the imported goods 
or export goods where he differs with the self 
assessment of an importer or an exporter. This 
important change was not brought to the attention of 
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Canon India Pvt Ltd 
Case. 
210. As mentioned above, an importer or an exporter is 
merely required to make a self-assessment in the Bill(s) 
of Entry or Shipping Bill(s) as may be in the case of 
import or export respectively and file the same. 
211. Officers who are appointed as “Proper Officers” 
for the purpose of Section 17 of the Customs Act, 1962 
are “Officers of Customs” like any “Officer of 
Customs” as per Section 3 and 4 read with notification 
issued under these provisions. There is delegation of 
functions by the Board and senior officers to different 
class of officers by the Board. This is an internal 
arrangement with a view for better tax administration. 
Thus, officers of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence are 
also one among the class “Officers of Customs” like any 
Officer of Customs as per Section 3 and 4 read with 
notification issued for the said purpose are competent 
to issue show cause notice. The “proper officer” at the 
Port at the time of clearance of import or export, 
merely reassess the self-assessment already made on 
the Bill(s) of Entry and/or Shipping Bill(s). They are 
normally not assigned with the function to adjudicate 
Show Cause Notices and/or Demand Notices under the 
various provisions of the Customs Act, 1962. 
212. With effect from, 08.04.2011, there was no question 
of assessment of Bill(s) of Entry /Shipping Bill(s) by a 
“proper officer”. There is only self assessment by an 
importer or an exporter. There could be only re-
assessment of Bill of Entry(s) or the Shipping Bill(s) by 
the “proper officer” under Section 17 of the Customs 
Act,1962. 

213. If the “proper officer” was inclined to disagree 
with the self assessment made by an importer or an 
exporter as the case may be, the “proper officer” could 
make a re-assessment and pass a speaking order under 
Section 17(5) of the Customs Act, 1962. 
214. If the self assessment is accepted, the “proper 
officer” appointed under Section 17 of the Customs Act, 
1962 becomes “functus officio” under the scheme of the 
Act and the Notification issued for the aforesaid 
purpose. 
215. Likewise, where there was a re-assessment, again 
such an officer becomes “functus officio”, after such an 
order of re-assessment and a speaking order under 
Section 17(5) of the Customs Act, 1962 is passed. 
216. An importer or an exporter aggrieved by such an 
order of reassessment and the speaking order is entitled 
to file an appeal under Section 128 of the Custom 
Act,1962 before the Appellate Commissioner. Only 
circumstances, where such an officer who makes an 
order of reassessment can re-visit the re-assessment 
and/or speaking order is under Section 28 (if 
specifically authorized) or under Section 149 or under 
Section 154 of the Customs Act, 1962. 
217. The power to issue Show Cause Notice whether 
under Section 28 or under Chapter XIV of Customs Act, 
1962 or under any other provisions and to pass orders 
has been by and large exercised by the Superior Officers 
from Group 'A' Cadre Officer of the Custom Department 
in terms of Notification issued under Section 2(34) of 
the Act. The Officers from the Directorate of Revenue 
Intelligence (DRI) being “Officers of Custom” have 
been recognized as a “Proper Officer” for the aforesaid 
purpose. 
218. The “proper officer” who is/was involved at the 
stage of assessment under Section 17 of the Act upto 
08.04.2011 and reassessment after 08.04.2011 have 
rarely been involved in collateral adjudication of 

notices issued under Section 28 of the Act. However, 
once again at the stage of recovery of duty or penalty 
under other provision of the Customs Act, 1962 or 
redemption fine under Section 125 of the Customs Act, 
1962, they are authorized. 
219. Mostly, at the time of clearance of imported goods 
or export goods for the purpose of assessment under 
Section 17 of the Custom Act,1962, it is the 
Superintendent/Appraisers of Customs from Group 'B' 
Executive - Gazetted Officers who act as “proper 
officers”. They are merely required to verify the entries 
made in the Bill(s) of Entry filed under Section 46 of the 
Act (in case of import) and or Shipping Bill(s) filed 
under Section 50 of the Act (in case of export). As 
“proper officers” are required to merely examine or 
test any imported or export goods or such parts thereof. 
Such Officer of Customs under the Scheme of the Act 
and Notification issued thereunder can only re-assess 
the self-assessment made by the importer or the 
exporter. 
220. Earlier, the Officers from the Directorate of 
Revenue Intelligence (DRI) were mostly confined with 
the task of investigation. Over a period of time, they 
were empowered to issue Show Cause Notices and/or 
Demand Notices under various provisions of the 
Customs Act. Adjudication of the Show Cause 
Notices/Demand Notices were however left to the 
senior officer of customs from Group 'A' cadre of the 
Customs Department. However, they are empowered 
to act as “proper officers” not only for issuance of 
Show Cause Notice and/or Demand Notices but also 
for adjudication of such Show Cause Notices and/or 
Demand Notices.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
88. In case of re-assessment, such a “proper officer” is bound to pass a 
“Speaking Order” to enable the aggrieved party to file an appeal. Section 17 

as it read before 08.04.2011 and after 08.04.2011 is reproduced below to 
better appreciate the nuances of the issue: 
Section 17: Assessment of Duty 
Before 08.04.2011 
Between 08.04.2011 and 
28.03.2018 
(1) After an importer has entered 
any imported goods under section 
46 or an exporter has entered any 
export goods under section 50, the 
imported goods or the export 
goods, as the case may be, or such 
part thereof as may be necessary 
may, without undue delay, be 
examined and tested by the proper 
officer. 
(1) An importer entering any 
imported goods under section 46, 
or an exporter entering any export 
goods under section 50, shall, save 
as otherwise provided in section 
85, self-assess the duty, if any, 
leviable on such goods. 
(2) After such examination and 
testing, the duty, if any, leviable on 
such goods shall, save as otherwise 
provided in section 85, be assessed. 
(2) The proper officer may verify 
the self-assessment of such goods 
and for this purpose, examine or 
test any imported goods or export 
goods or such part thereof as may 
be necessary. 
(3) For the purpose of assessing 
duty under sub-section (2), the 
proper officer may require the 
importer, exporter or any other 
person to produce any contract, 
broker's note, policy of insurance, 
catalogue 
or 
other 
document 
whereby the duty leviable on the 
imported goods or export goods, as 
the 
case 
may 
be, 
can 
be 
ascertained, and to furnish any 
information required for such 
ascertainment which is in his power 
to 
produce 
or 
furnish, 
and 
thereupon the importer, exporter or 

For verification of self-
assessment under sub-section (2), 
the proper officer may require the 
importer, exporter or any other 
person to produce any contract, 
broker's note, insurance policy, 
catalogue or other document, 
whereby the duty leviable on the 
imported goods or export goods, 
as the case may be, can be 
ascertained, and to furnish any 
information required for such 
ascertainment which is in his 
power to produce or furnish, and 
thereupon, the importer, exporter 

such other person shall produce 
such document and furnish such 
information. or such other person shall produce 
such document or furnish such 
information. 

Notwithstanding 
anything 
contained in this section, imported 
goods or export goods may, prior to 
the examination or testing thereof, 
be permitted by the proper officer 
to be assessed to duty on the basis 
of the statements made in the entry 
relating thereto and the documents 
produced and the information 
furnished under sub-section (3); 
but if it is found subsequently on 
examination or testing of the goods 
or otherwise that any statement in 
such entry or document or any 
information so furnished is not true 
in respect of any matter relevant to 
the assessment, the goods may, 
without prejudice to any other 
action which may be taken under 
this Act, be re-assessed to duty. 

Where 
it 
is 
found 
on 
verification, 
examination 
or 
testing of the goods or otherwise 
that the self-assessment is not done 
correctly, the proper officer may, 
without prejudice to any other 
action which may be taken under 
this Act, re-assess the duty leviable 
on such goods. Amendment of 
section 18. 
(5) Where any assessment done 
under sub-section (2) is contrary to 
the claim of the importer or 
exporter regarding valuation of 
goods, classification, exemption or 
concessions 
of 
duty 
availed 
consequent to any notification 
therefor under this Act, and in 
cases other than those where the 
importer or the exporter, as the 
case 
may 
be, 
confirms 
his 
acceptance of the said assessment 
writing, the proper officer shall 
pass a speaking order within fifteen 
days from the date of assessment of 
the bill of entry or the shipping bill, 
as the case may be. 
(5) Where any re-assessment done 
under sub-section (4) is contrary 
to the self-assessment done by the 
importer or exporter regarding 
valuation of goods, classification, 
exemption or concessions of duty 
availed 
consequent 
to 
any 
notification issued therefor under 
this Act and in cases other than 
those where the importer or 
exporter, as the case may be, 
confirms his acceptance of the said 
re-assessment in 
writing, 
the 
proper 
officer 
shall 
pass 
a 
speaking 
order 
on 
the 
re-
assessment, within fifteen days 
from the date of re-assessment of 
the bill of entry or the shipping bill, 
as the case may be. 

[(6) Where re-assessment has not 
been done or a speaking order has 
not been passed on re-assessment, 
the proper officer may audit the 
assessment of duty of the imported 
goods or export goods at his office 
or at the premises of the importer 
or exporter, as may be expedient, 
in such manner as may be 
prescribed.] * Explanation.— For 
the removal of doubts, it is hereby 
declared that in cases where an 
importer has entered any imported 
goods under section 46 or an 
exporter has entered any export 
goods under section 50 before the 
date on which the Finance Bill, 
2011 receives the assent of the 
President, such imported goods or 
export goods shall continue to be 
governed by the provisions of 
section 17 as it stood immediately 
before the date on which such 
assent is received." 
 
89. The examination of Section 17, as amended vide the Finance Act, 2011 vis-
à-vis the provisions of the old Section 17 as it stood prior to 08.04.2011, 
highlights the following major changes: 
(a) Self-assessment of duty: The concept of self-assessment of duty was 
introduced by way of the amendment to Section 17 wherein there is no 
role of the proper officer to assess the duty at the first instance. The 
onus for providing the duty leviable has been shifted to the assessee 
itself. 

(b) Discretion to verify: Sub-section (2) of the new Section 17 states that 
“The proper officer may verify the self-assessment of the goods…”. The 
use of the word “may” indicates two things: 

that the actions to be taken by the proper officer under the old 
Section 17 are no longer compulsory. The proper officer may 
choose to accept the self-assessment made by the assessee, 
thereby becoming functus officio and there is no compulsion on 
him or her to examine or test any goods for reaching a first 
instance assessment; 
(ii) The proper officer is not involved in the assessment of duty under 
Section 17 at the first instance except for his or her role in 
accepting or not accepting the self-assessed duty. There can be 
three situations that may result from such limited role of the 
proper officer: 
 
The proper officer accepts the self-assessed duty without 
verification of such duty under sub-section (2) of the new 
Section 17, 
 
The proper officer accepts the self-assessed duty after 
verifying the same in accordance with sub-sections (2) and 
(3) of the new Section 17, 

 
The proper officer does not accept the self-assessed duty 
after verifying the same in accordance with sub-sections (2) 
and (3) of the new Section 17, in which case, the re-
assessment of duty will be undertaken by the proper officer 
as per sub-sections (4) and (5) of the new Section 17. 
In the first two cases, the scope of the function of the proper officer is 
limited. Such proper officer is not entitled to exercise the function of 
the assessment of duty, which is a noteworthy deviation from the earlier 
procedure. 
The proper officer is entitled to exercise his or her functions of re-
assessment of duty only if the verification process shows that the self-
assessment done by the assessee was incorrect. 
(c) Condition precedent for re-assessment: It is worthwhile to note that 
the old Section 17 allowed for self-assessment of duty, only under sub-
section (4) and that too with the permission of the proper officer. 
However, upon a subsequent finding that the statements made by the 
assessee were not true, the proper officer was entitled to re-assess the 
duty so levied. Therefore, re-assessment was allowed under both the 
old and the new Section 17 only after a self-assessment by the assessee. 
The only point of difference with respect to re-assessment is that self-
assessment was not a matter of course prior to the amendment and was 

possible only upon the proper officer permitting for the same. After 
08.04.2011, self-assessment is ipso jure the procedure and has replaced 
the assessment process previously undertaken by the proper officer. 
(d) Scheme of Section 17(5): The old Section 17(5) requires the proper 
officer to provide a speaking order within 15 days of the date of 
assessment of duty if the same is contrary to the claim of the assessee 
or is not accepted in writing by the assessee. The new Section 17(5) is 
analogous to the old sub-section (5) except that it requires a speaking 
order within 15 days from the date of the “re-assessment” of duty. Such 
change shows the legislative intent to transfer the process of 
“assessment” under the old Section 17 to the stage of “re-assessment” 
under the new Section 17 and replace the “assessment” to be done by 
the proper officer under the old Section 17 with the process of “self-
assessment”. 
90. These changes highlight that the competence of the proper officer to conduct 
“assessment” is completely taken away by the legislature vide the 
amendment to Section 17. The new Section 17 empowers the proper officer 
to perform the functions of verification of self-assessment and subsequent 
re-assessment, if found necessary. However, such re-assessment is not a 
mandatory function on the same footing as “assessment” under the old 

Section 17. Therefore, in our considered view the scope of the functions of 
the proper officer under the new Section 17 is limited. 
91. It is evident from the aforesaid that the attention of this Court in Canon 
India (supra) was not drawn to the important changes brought to Section 17 
of the Act, 1962 vide Section 38 of the Finance Act, 2011 with effect from 
08.04.2011. 
92. The observation in paragraph 13 in Canon India (supra) that “where one 
officer has exercised his powers of assessment, the power to order 
reassessment must also be exercised by the same officer or his successor and 
not by another officer of another department though he is designated to be 
an officer of the same rank” has been made without taking note of the 
changes to Section 17 of the Act, 1962 with effect from 08.04.2011. 
93. Similarly, the observation in paragraph 14 in Canon India (supra) is 
erroneous. The relevant paragraph is reproduced below: 
“We find it completely impermissible to allow an officer, 
who has not passed the original order of assessment, to 
re-open the assessment on the grounds that the duty was 
not paid/not levied, by the original officer who had 
decided to clear the goods and who was competent and 
authorised to make the assessment. The nature of the 
power conferred by Section 28(4) to recover duties 
which have escaped assessment is in the nature of an 
administrative review of an act. The section must 
therefore be construed as conferring the power of such 
review on the same officer or his successor or any other 
officer who has been assigned the function of 
assessment.” 

In other words, the conclusion that an officer who did the assessment, could 
only undertake reassessment under Section 28(4) was arrived at without 
taking note of the abovementioned amendment to Section 17 of the Act, 
1962 with effect from 08.04.2011 vide Section 38 of the Finance Act, 2011. 
The judgment in Canon India (supra) also recorded an erroneous finding 
that the function of re-assessment is with reference to Section 28(4) when in 
fact it is an exercise of function under Section 17. 
94. Further, in Canon India (supra) the subject show cause notice was dated 
19.09.2014 in respect of the Bill of Entry filed on 20.03.2012. This Court 
appears to have erroneously applied the provisions of Section 17 of the Act, 
1962, as they stood prior to 08.04.2011 as opposed to the amended Section 
17 which ought to have been applied. iv. 
Scheme of Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 
95. Section 17 read with Sections 46 and 47 of the Act, 1962 deals with the 
assessment and re-assessment at the first instance that is, upon entry of the 
consignments and clearance of bill(s) of entry. The amendment to Section 
17 introduces the process of self-assessment and subsequent re-assessment 
upon verification by the proper officer, if so required, for undertaking a 
check at the first instance. 
96. The proceedings under Section 28 are subsequent to the completion of the 
process set out in Section 17 of the Act, 1962. The procedure envisaged 

under Section 28 is in the nature of a quasi-judicial proceeding with the 
issuance of the show cause notice by the proper officer followed by 
adjudication of such notices by the field customs officers. It is also worth 
noting that in the case of DRI, the proceedings under Section 28 start only 
after an investigation has been undertaken by DRI. This is reaffirmed by 
Circular No. 4/99-Cus dated 15.02.1999 and Circular No. 44/2011-
Customs dated 23.11.2011. Therefore, the nature of review under Section 
28 is significantly different from the nature of assessment and re-
assessment under Section 17. The ambit of Section 28 has also been 
restricted to the review of assessments and re-assessments done under 
Section 17 for ascertaining if there has been a short-levy, non-levy, part-
payment, non-payment or erroneous refund. 
97. Keeping this statutory scheme in mind, we are unable to subscribe to the 
view taken in both Sayed Ali (supra) and Canon India (supra), namely, 
that the vesting of the functions of assessment and re-assessment under 
Section 17 is a threshold, mandatory condition for a proper officer to 
perform functions under Section 28. This scheme does not flow from the 
scheme of the statute and was judicially read in to avoid the possibility of 
chaos and confusion due to the potential for multiple proper officers 
exercising jurisdiction under Section 28. We find that such apprehensions 
of misuse are unfounded considering that no substantial empirical evidence 

has been brought forth by the respondents in this case to support such a 
view. Regardless, the the parameters under Section 28 cannot be reduced 
to an administrative review of assessment/re-assessment done under 
Section 17. 
98. We are conscious of the fact that Section 110AA of the Act, 1962, which 
has been introduced by the Finance Act, 2022, stipulates that a show cause 
notice under Section 28 of the Act, 1962 can only be issued by that "proper 
officer" who has been conferred with the jurisdiction, by an assignment of 
functions under Section 5 of the Act, 1962, to conduct assessment under 
Section 17 of the Act in respect of such duty. However, we are of the view 
that the introduction of Section 110AA doesn't alter the statutory scheme 
of Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 as it stood prior to the introduction 
of Section 110AA. The legislature in its wisdom may introduce certain new 
provisions keeping in mind the exigencies of administration and taking into 
account the evolution of law. However, this would not by itself mean that 
the procedure which was being followed prior to the introduction of such 
changes was incorrect or in contravention of the law. The legality and 
correctness of an action has to be adjudged based on the statutory scheme 
prevailing at the time when such action took place, and incorrectness or 
invalidity cannot be imputed to it on the basis of subsequent changes in 
law. Seen thus, the contention of the respondents that Section 110AA of 

the Act, 1962 amounts to an admission by the petitioner on the invalidity 
of the legal position existing prior to its introduction, deserves to be 
rejected. 
99. Therefore, in our considered view, the scheme of Sections 17 and 28 of the 
Act, 1962 indicates that there cannot be a mandatory condition linking the 
two provisions and the interpretation of this Court in the cases of Sayed Ali 
(supra) and Canon India (supra) is patently erroneous. v. 
Use of the article ‘the’ in the expression “the proper officer” 
100. This Court in Canon India (supra), while laying much emphasis on the use 
of the expression “the proper officer” observed that the Parliament had 
employed the article “the” instead of “a/an” in Section 28 of the Act, 1962 
so as to give effect to its intention of specifying that the proper officer 
referred to in Section 28 is the same officer as the one referred to in Section 
17. The Court further observed that the use of a definite article instead of an 
indefinite article is indicative of the fact that the proper officer referred to in 
Section 28 is not “any” proper officer but “the” proper officer assigned with 
the function of assessment and reassessment under Section 17. 
101. However, there is an error apparent in the aforesaid view. Undoubtedly, a 
definite article “the” has been used before “proper officer” with a view to 
limit the exercise of powers under Section 28 by a specific proper officer 
and not any proper officer. But, in the absence of any statutory linkage 

between Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 respectively, there was no legal 
footing for this Court in Canon India (supra) to hold that “the proper 
officer” in Section 28 must necessarily be the same proper officer referred 
to under Section 17 of the Act, 1962. 
102. As we have discussed in the foregoing parts of this judgment, the statutory 
scheme of the Act, 1962 necessitates that a proper officer can only perform 
specific functions under the Act if he has been assigned as “the proper 
officer” to perform such functions by an appropriate notification issued by 
the competent authority. Seen thus, it becomes clear that an officer of 
Customs can only perform the functions under Section 28 of the Act, 1962 
if such officer has been designated as “the proper officer” for the purposes 
of Section 28 by an appropriate notification. The use of the article “the” in 
the expression “the proper officer” should be read in the context of that 
proper officer who has been conferred with the powers of discharging the 
functions under Section 28 by conferment under Section 5. In other words, 
the proper officer is qua the function or power to be discharged or exercised. 
103. Thus, the definite article “the” in Section 28 refers to a “proper officer” who 
has been conferred with the powers to discharge functions under Section 28 
by virtue of a notification issued by the competent authority under Section 
5. In other words, the use of article “the” in Section 28 has no apparent 
relation with the proper officer referred to under Section 17. The proper 

officer under Section 28 could be said to be determinable only in the sense 
that he is a proper officer who has been empowered to perform the functions 
under Section 28 by means of a notification issued under Section 5 of the 
Act, 1962. 
104. In Canon India (supra), this Court held that DRI officers did not have the 
power of issuing show cause notices under Section 28 as they did not fall 
within the meaning of the expression “the proper officers” used in Section 
28 for the reason that they did not possess the power of assessment under 
Section 17 of the Act, 1962. However, as we have discussed in the previous 
parts of this judgment, contrary to the aforesaid observations of the Court, 
DRI officers were notified as “the proper officer” for the purposes of 
Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 respectively vide Notification No. 
44/2011–Cus–N.T. dated 06.07.2011 issued by the Central Government. 
Hence, those officers of DRI who were designated as “the proper officer” 
for the purpose of Section 28 by the aforesaid notification were competent 
to issue show cause notices under Section 28. 
105. Craies on Statute Law1 has stated that “the language of statutes is not always 
that which a rigid grammarian would use, it must be borne in mind that a 
statute consists of two parts, the letter and the sense”. It was observed by 
this Court in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Ganesweara Rao, reported in AIR 
 
1 7th Ed., Page 83 

1963 SC 1850 that the aforesaid rule of construction that the provisions of a 
statute are to be read together and given effect to and that it is the duty of 
the court to construe a statute harmoniously has gained general acceptance. 
In Management, S.S.L. Rly. Co. v. S.S.R.W. Union reported in AIR 1969 
SC 513, this Court observed that the principle that literal meaning of the 
word in a statute is to be preferred is subject to the exception that if such 
literal sense would give rise to any anomaly or would result in something 
which would defeat the purpose of the Act, a strict grammatical adherence 
to the words should be avoided as far as possible. The above principles 
would help us to desist from affording undue stress on the definite article 
“the” used before the expression “proper officer” in Section 28 of the Act, 
1962. vi. 
DRI officers as proper officers under section 2(34) 
106. In Canon India (supra), this Court erroneously concluded that an officer 
from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) was not an officer of 
customs and therefore cannot function as a “Proper Officer”. The finding of 
the Court that the power conferred by the Board under Notification No. 
40/2012-Customs (N.T.) dated 02.05.2012 was ill-founded is an error 
apparent. 
107. By way of Notification No. 40/2012-Customs (N.T.) dated 02.05.2012, the 
Board appointed several persons including the Officers of Directorate of 

Revenue Intelligence (DRI) as “Proper Officers” under Section 2(34) of the 
Act, 1962. 
108. Section 2(34) of the Act, 1962 also stood amended under the Finance Act, 
2022. Section 2(34) of the Act, 1962 together with the amendment is 
reproduced below:

109. The Notification No. 40/2012-Customs (N.T.) dated 02.05.2012, issued 
under Section 2(34) of the Act, 1962 cannot be read in isolation. It has to 
be read in conjunction with Section 4(1) of the Act, 1962 and the 
Notification issued thereunder. 
110. The view that the “Proper Officer” for the purpose of Section 28 and other 
provisions of the Act, 1962 could only mean the person who cleared the 
goods or the officer who succeeds such officer and not any other officer 

from any other department requires reconsideration in view of the changes 
to the Act, 1962 vide the Finance Act, 2011 and also in the light of Section 
4 and the notification issued thereunder. 
111. This Court in paragraphs 11 to 15 of Canon India (supra) proceeded on 
the footing that under the provisions of the Act, 1962, the Board has no 
power to appoint “Proper Officers”. 
112. As per Section 4 of the Act, 1962, the Board constituted under the 
provisions of Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963 is vested with the power 
to appoint such persons as it thinks fit to be “officers of customs”. 
113. Under sub-section (1) to Section 4(1) of the Act, 1962, the Board may 
appoint such person as Officers of Customs as it thinks fit. Under Section 
4(2) of the Act, 1962 the Board can even authorize a Chief Commissioner 
of Customs or a Joint or Assistant or Deputy Commissioner of Customs to 
appoint any officers below the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Customs 
as an “officer of customs”. It appears that this aspect was also not brought 
to the notice of this Court in Canon India (supra). vii. 
Section 4 of the Act, 1962 
114. For an easy reference, Section 4 of the Act, 1962 is reproduced below: 
“Section 4: Appointment of “Officers of Customs”: 
1) The Board may appoint such persons as it thinks fit 
to be Officers of Customs. 

2) Without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (1), 
[Board may authorise a Principal Chief Commissioner 
of Customs or a Chief Commissioner of Customs 
Principal Commissioner of Customs or Commissioner 
of Customs) or Joint or Assistant Commissioner of 
Customs or Joint or Assistant Commissioner of Customs 
or Deputy Commissioner of Customs to appoint officers 
of customs below the rank of Assistant Commissioner of 
Customs.]” 
 
115. It is relevant to note that it is only an officer of customs, appointed under 
Section 4(1) of the Act, 1962 who can be designated as the “proper officer” 
as defined in Section 2(34) of the Act, 1962 by a notification. The 
notifications issued under Section 2(34) and 4(1) of the Act, 1962 are 
nothing but an internal arrangement for the purpose of allocation of work 
among the officers of customs. 
116. In M/s. N.C. Alexander (supra), the High Court has extensively explained 
how officers of the DRI are officers of customs. We quote the relevant 
observations: 
“236. The officers of the Directorate of Revenue 
Intelligence (DRI) have already been appointed as 
“Officers of Customs” under Notification issued under 
Section 4(1) of the Customs Act, 1962 vide Notification 
of the Government of India in the Ministry of Finance 
(Department of Revenue) No.186-Cus, dated 4 th 
August, 1981. The said Notification was later 
superseded by Notification No.19/90- Cus (N.T.), dated 
26.04.1990. 

237. By Notification No.19/90- Cus (N.T.), dated 
26.04.1990, the officers from the Directorate of Revenue 
Intelligence (DRI) were appointed as Collectors and 
Assistant Collectors of Customs in the area mentioned 
in Column-I of the said notification. 
238. 
Notification 
No.19/90- 
Cus 
(N.T.), 
dated 
26.04.1990 was later superseded by Notification 
No.17/2002-Cus. (N.T.) dated 07.03.2002, whereby, 
various officers from the Directorate General of 
Revenue Intelligence and Directorate of Revenue 
Intelligence were appointed as Commissioner of 
Customs and as Additional Commissioner and Joint 
Commissioner 
of 
Customs 
and 
Deputy 
Commissioner/Assistant Commissioner of Customs. 
Thus, they were appointed as Officers of Customs. 
Relevant portion Notification No.17/2002-Cus. (N.T.), 
dated 07.03.2002 is reproduced below:- Directorate of 
Revenue Intelligence (D.R.I.) Officers appointed as 
Customs Officers – Notification No.19/90 - Cus. (N.T.)

1962) and in supersession of notification of the 
Government of India in the Ministry of Finance 
(Department of Revenue) No.19/90- Customs (N.T.), 
dated the 26th April, 1990, the Central Government 
appoints the officers mentioned in Column (2) of the 
Table below to the Commissioner of Customs, the 
officers mentioned in column (3) thereof to be the 
Additional Commissioners or Joint Commissioners of 
Customs and Officers mentioned in column(4) thereof to 
be 
the 
Deputy

or 
Assistant 
Commissioners of Customs for the areas mentioned in

07.03.2002 came into force on 25.10.2002 vide 
Notification No.63/2002-Cus. (N.T.) dated 03.10.2002. 
Notification No.17/2002-Cus. (N.T.), dated 07.03.2002 
was further amended by Notification No.82/2014-Cus. 
(N.T.), dated 16.09.2014. 
240. Thus, the officers from the Directorate of Revenue 
Intelligence have been appointed as “Officers of 
Customs” under Section 4 of the Customs Act, 1962 and 
therefore they are “Proper Officers” for the purpose of 
Section 2(34) of the Customs Act, 1962. This aspect was 
not brought to the attention of the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court in Canon India Private Ltd. case referred to 
supra. 
241. With a view to streamline the allocation of work 
and for the purposes of Section 17 and Section 28 of the 
Customs Act, 1962, Notification No. 44/2011-Cus. 
(N.T.), dated 06.07.2011 was issued by the Board under 
Section 2(34) of the Act. 
242. Notification No.44/2011-Cus. (N.T.), dated 
06.07.2011 was issued under Section 2(34) of the 
Customs Act, 1962 for the purpose of identifying officers 
of customs for exercising the power and function under 
the Customs Act,1962. 

243. Notification No.44/2011-Cus. (N.T.), dated 
06.07.2011 was later amended by Notification 
No.53/2012-Cus. (N.T.) dated 21.06.2012 and still later 
by 
Notification 
No.43/2019-Cus. 
(N.T.) 
dated 
18.06.2019 
and 
eventually 
has 
been 
rescinded/superseded by Notification No.25/2022-Cus. 
(N.T.) dated 31.03.2022 in tune with the amendment 
proposed in the Finance Bill, 2022 and passed by 
Finance Act, 2022. 
244. Among various officers of the Customs, following 
officers were also assigned to act and function as the 
“Proper Officer” under Notification No.44/2011 – Cus. 
(N.T.) dated 06.07.2011:-

245. Thus, over a period of time, the officers of 
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) who are 
primarily drawn from the Customs Department were 

also given the task of issuing show cause notice and 
adjudicating the same in terms of Notifications issued as 
“Proper Officer”, as defined in Section 2(34) of the 
Customs Act, 1962. 
 246. Now, under the amended Section 2(34), the word 
“under Section 5” has been inserted. Thus, what was 
implicit in the Customs Act, 1962 has now been made 
explicit in the amendment to the Customs Act, 1962 vide 
Finance Act, 2022. 
 247. As per Section 5(1) of the Act, an “Officer of 
Customs” may exercise the powers and discharge the 
duties conferred or imposed on him under the Customs 
Act, 1962, subject to such conditions and limitations as 
the Board may impose. 
248. The power to be exercised may be subject to such 
conditions and limitations as the Board may impose on 
such an “Officer of Customs”. Such officers can also 
exercise the powers and discharge the duties conferred 
or imposed on any other officers of customs who is 
subordinate to such officers. This aspect was also not 
brought to the attention of the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
in Canon India Private Limited Vs. Commissioner of 
Customs case referred to supra. 
249. Only exception that has been provided was in Sub-
Section (3) to Section 5 of the Act. As per Sub-Section 3 
to Section 5 of the Act, a Commissioner (Appeals) 
cannot exercise the power and discharge the duties 
conferred or imposed on an “Officer of Customs” other 
than those specified in Section 108 of the Act and 
Chapter XV deals with the Appeals and Revisions. 
250. Section 5 of the Customs Act, 1962 has also been 
amended in the Finance Act, 2022. Sub-Section (1A), 
(1B) and Sub-Section (4) and (5) to Section 5 of the 
Customs Act, 1962 have been now inserted. Section 5 as 
it stood prior to amendment and as it stands after 
amendment read as under:- 

TABLE 
5. Powers of Officers of Customs of the Customs Act, 

Before 
the 
amendment Section 
After the 2022 amendment 
(1) Subject to such conditions and limitations as the 
Board may impose, an officer of customs may exercise 
the powers and discharge the duties conferred or 
imposed on him under this Act. 
 
1(A): Without prejudice to the 
provisions 
contained 
in 
subsection (1), the Board may, 
by notification, assign such 
functions as it may deem fit, to 
an officer of customs, 91 who 
shall be the proper officer in 
relation to such functions. 
 
(1B) Within their jurisdiction 
assigned by the Board, the 
Principal Commissioner of 
Customs or Commissioner of 
Customs, as the case may be, 
may, by order, assign such 
functions, as he may deem fit, 
to an “Officer of Customs”, 
who shall be the “Proper 
Officer” in relation to such 
functions.” 
(2) An Officer of Customs may excise the powers and 
discharge the duties conferred or imposed under this 
Act on any other officer of Customs who is subordinate 
to him. 
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in this 
Section, a Commissioner (Appeals) shall not exercise 
the powers and discharge the duties conferred or 
imposed on an officer of customs other than those 
specified in Chapter XV and Section 108. 
 
“(4) 
In 
specifying 
the 
conditions 
and 
limitations 
referred to in sub-section (1), 
and in assigning functions 

under sub-section (1A), the 
Board may consider any one 
or more of the following 
criteria, including, but not 
limited to–– a) territorial 
jurisdiction; b) persons or 
class of persons; c) goods or 
class of goods; 
d) cases or class of cases; e) 
computer assigned random 
assignment; 
f) 
any 
other 
criterion as the Board may, by 
notification, specify. 

The 
Board 
may, 
by 
notification, 
wherever 
necessary 
or 
appropriate, 
require two or more officers of 
customs (whether or not of the 
same class) to have concurrent 
powers and functions to be 
performed under this Act.”. 
251. During the interregnum in 2012, a more 
comprehensive 
notification 
was 
issued 
vide 
Notification 
No.40/2012-Cus. 
(N.T.), 
dated 
02.05.2012. This notification fell for consideration in 
Canon India Private Limited Vs. Commissioner of 
Customs, 

E.L.T.3(S.C). 
However, 
No.40/2012-Cus. (N.T.), dated 02.05.2012 cannot be 
read in isolation. It had to be read along with 
notifications issued under Section 4 of the Customs 
Act, 1962. 
 252. Notification No.40/2012-Cus. (N.T.), dated 
02.05.2012 was also amended from time to time and has 
now 
been 
eventually 
rescinded/superseded 
by 
Notification No.26/2022-Cus. (N.T.), dated 31- 3-2022 
in tune with the amendment proposed in the Finance 
Bill, 2022 and passed by Finance Act, 2022. 

 253. Both Notification No.44/2011-Cus. (N.T.), dated 
06.07.2011 and Notification No. 40/2012-Cus. (N.T.), 
dated 02.05.2012 as amended from time to time have 
also not been challenged directly by any of the 
petitioners. 
 254. Although, the vires of Notification No.40/2012-
Cus. (N.T.), dated 02.05.2012 was neither challenged 
or questioned before the Court in Canon India 
Private Limited Vs. Commissioner of Customs, 2021 
(376) E.L.T.3(S.C) nor the issue of jurisdiction was 
canvassed before the Tribunal, the Hon’ble Supreme 
has held that the officers of the Directorate of 
Revenue Intelligence were not “Proper Officers” as 
they are not Officers of Customs and therefore there 
had to be issue of an independent Notification under 
Section 6 of the Customs Act, 1962.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
viii. 
Section 6 of the Act, 1962 
117. This Court in Canon India (supra) made certain observations on the purport 
of Section 6 of the Act, 1962 and held that the Notification No. 40/2012 
dated 02.05.2012 which empowered the DRI officers to perform functions 
under Section 28 was invalid. The relevant portion of the judgment is 
reproduced below: 
“21. If it was intended that officers of the Directorate 
of Revenue Intelligence who are officers of Central 
Government should be entrusted with functions of the 
Customs officers, it was imperative that the Central 
Government should have done so in exercise of its 
power under Section 6 of the Act. The reason why such 
a power is conferred on the Central Government is 
obvious and that is because the Central Government is 

the authority which appoints both the officers of the 
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence which is set up 
under the Notification dated 04.12.1957 issued by the 
Ministry of Finance and Customs officers who, till 
11.5.2002, were appointed by the Central Government. 
The notification which purports to entrust functions as 
proper officer under the Customs Act has been issued 
by the Central Board of Excise and Customs in 
exercise of non-existing power under Section 2 (34) of 
the Customs Act. The notification is obviously invalid 
having been issued by an authority which had no 
power to do so in purported exercise of powers under a 
section which does not confer any such power.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
118. It was held that Section 6 is the only section which provides for the 
entrustment of the functions of customs officers to other officers of the 
Central or State Government or local authority. As a result of the judgment 
in Canon India (supra), the respondents herein vociferously argued that 
Section 5 of the Act, 1962 only deals with the powers and duties and not 
functions and it is Section 6 which refers to functions. Such argument 
proceeded on the erroneous footing that any notification empowering the 
DRI should have been issued under Section 6 of the Act, 1962 and not 
having been done so, the show cause notice issued by the DRI was without 
jurisdiction. 
119. Section 6 of the Act, 1962 reads thus: 
“6. Entrustment of functions of Board and customs 
officers on certain other officers.—The Central 
Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, 

entrust either conditionally or unconditionally to any 
officer of the Central or the State Government or a 
local authority any functions of the Board or any officer 
of customs under this Act.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
120. It is evident on a plain reading of Section 6 of the Act, 1962 referred to 
above that the same contemplates the entrustment of the functions of the 
Board or any officer of customs under the Act, 1962 to any of the officers 
of the Central or the State Government or a local authority. Such 
entrustment could be either conditional or unconditional. As per Section 
6 of the Act, 1962, the Central Government may by notification in the 
Official Gazette entrust the functions of the Board or the officers of 
Customs to any of the following officers, namely, any officer of: 
(i) The Central Government; or 
(ii) The State Government; or 
(iii) A local authority. 
121. Section 6 replaced Section 8 of the erstwhile Sea Customs Act, 1878 under 
which the powers of officers of customs, at places where there is no Customs 
House, are exercised by the land revenue officers of the district. This is no 
longer necessary as the Central Excise officers are available all over the 
country. Further the powers of customs officers at times need to be conferred 
on other officers, like police officers. Section 6, therefore, makes a general 
provision empowering the Central Government to entrust the functions of 

the Board or an officer of customs to any officer of the Central or State 
government or a local authority. 
122. The object of this Section is to confer powers of search, seizure, arrest and 
recording of statements, to the officers working in border states like officers 
of police service, Border Security Force, Tehsildar, Indo Tibet Border 
Police Force and others. Similarly, officers working in the coast guard or 
the navy may also be given such powers as they may be involved in anti-
smuggling operations. 
123. The Board has notified entrustment of powers to various officers working 
in different departments either under the State services or Central services 
from time to time. An illustration of this is M.F.(D.R.) Notification No. 
161-Cus. dated the 22.06.1963 which empowered specified officers of DRI 
with the power to search premises. It is worth noting that this notification 
under Section 6 was issued prior to the notification no. 17/2002 dated 
07.03.2002. 
124. Notification No. 17/2002 dated 07.03.2002 was issued under Section 4(1) 
of the Act appointing DRI officers as officers of customs. The powers of 
officers of customs to discharge duties under the Act is derived from 
Section 5. 
125. A plain reading of Section 6 of the Act, 1962 referred to above, makes it 
abundantly clear that it applies only to officers from departments other than 

the officers of the customs under Section 4 of the Act, 1962. The officers of 
DRI are not any other officers of the Central Government or the State 
Government or the local authority to be entrusted with the functions of the 
Board and the Customs Officers. It has been rightly observed by the High 
Court of Madras in M/s N.C. Alexander (supra) that post 07.03.2002, a 
notification of the Central Government under Section 6 is not required to 
recognise the officers from DRI as officers of customs. 
126. The observations of the High Court in M/s N.C. Alexander (supra) in the 
aforesaid context with which we are in complete agreement are reproduced 
hereinbelow: 
“269. By such entrustment, these officers of other 
Departments do not become Officers of Customs. They 
can merely function as such officers. Since 
entrustment under Section 6 is on the officers from 
other department, the Parliament by design has given 
the powers to the Central Government and not to the 
Board. 
270. As the Officers from the Directorate of Revenue 
Intelligence, Ministry of Finance (MOF) are already 
“Officers of Customs” before their induction and 
deputation to the Board in various Directorates, there is 
no impediment on their being appointed as proper 
officers for the purpose of Section 2(34) of the Customs 
Act, 1962. 
271. Merely because the Officers of the Customs and 
Central Excise Department are selected and are 
deputed in the respective Directorates does not mean 
that they cease to be Officers of the respective 
Departments as these Directorates are created only to 

assist the Board to implement the object of respective 
fiscal enactments. It is an internal arrangement within 
the Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue (DRI). 
272. If Section 3 and Section 4 of the Act and the 
Notification issued thereunder referred to supra were 
perhaps brought to the attention of the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court in Canon India Private Limited Vs. Commissioner 
of Customs, 2021 (376) E.L.T.3(S.C.), the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court would have given a different 
interpretation. In any event, these discussion are 
academic in the light of the validation in Section 97 of 
the Finance Act, 2022. 
273. It must also be remembered that the “Officers of 
Customs” in Section 3(1)(a) to (h) of the Customs Act, 
1962 (as amended under Section 3(1) (a) to (j) after 
2022 amendment) are Officers from Group 'A' Cadre of 
the Customs Department (IRS) like their counterparts 
from the Central Excise Department as Central Tax 
Officers under GST. 
274. A reading of Section 2(34) with Section 4 of the 
Customs Act, 1962 also makes it clear that the 
expression “proper officer” means the “Officer of 
Customs” who has been assigned those functions 
either by the Board or by the Principal Commissioner 
of Customs or by Commissioner of Customs in relation 
to any function to be performed under the Act. 
275. Notifications which have been issued to appoint 
these 
officers 
from 
Directorate 
of 
Revenue 
Intelligence (DRI) to act as “Proper Officers” are 
enabling Notification notwithstanding the fact that 
they are already “Officers of Customs” under 
Notification issued under Section 4(1) of the Customs 
Act,1962. 
276. Further, the Board can also authorize the Principal 
Commissioner of Customs or Chief Commissioner of 
Customs 
or 
Principal 
Chief 
Commissioner 
or 
Commissioner of Customs or Joint or Assistant or 

Deputy Commissioner of Customs, to appoint Officers 
of Customs below the rank of Assistant Commissioner of 
Customs. Thus, the following Group 'B' Executive - 
Gazetted and Non-Gazetted Officers assist in the initial 
stage of assessment of goods as:- 
Sl. 
No. 
Group 
‘B’ 
Executive Gazetted 
Officer 
Group ‘B’ Executive 
Non 
– 
Gazetted 
Officer 

Superintendent 
of 
Customs 

Preventive 
Officers 

Appraiser 
of 
Customs 
Examiner (Customs) 
277. As mentioned above, assessment is neither by the 
Group 'B' Executive – Gazetted Officer nor by Group 'B' 
Executive – Non-Gazetted Officer after 08.04.2011. 
Only, prior to 08.04.2011, the assessment of goods at 
the port was vested with the Group 'B' Executive – 
Gazetted Officer. However, after the said date, the 
fundamental of assessment has undergone a sea change 
and changed permanently as mentioned above. 
278. These fundamental changes brought to the manner 
of the assessment under the Customs Act, 1962 with 
effect from 08.04.2011 appear to have not been brought 
to the attention of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and 
therefore the assumption in the paragraph Nos.12 to 15 
in the case of Canon India Private Limited Vs. 
Commissioner of Customs, 2021 (376) E.L.T.3(S.C.) 
may require a re-consideration insofar as pending cases 
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and other Courts.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
127. Mr. N. Venkataraman, the Ld. ASG is correct in his submission that the 
distinction sought to be made between Section 5 and Section 6 of the Act, 

1962 (powers and duties vis-à-vis functions) could be said to be imaginary 
and may have very serious legal implications. 
128. The assignment of functions of the proper officer for the purposes of any 
section under the Act to an officer of customs is expressly mentioned in 
Section 2(34). Section 5 empowers the customs officer to discharge the 
duties of proper officer so conferred. Even prior to the amendment to 
Sections 2(34) and 5, this could be the only understanding with respect to 
the question of entrustment of functions of the proper officer to a customs 
officer. 
129. In our view, the assignment of functions of proper officers as mentioned in 
Section 2(34) and entrustment of functions of customs officers as mentioned 
in Section 6 operate on different planes. The assignment of functions of the 
proper officer is to be done only to officers of customs (whether they be 
appointed under Section 4 or entrusted with certain functions under Section 
6). There may be some overlap between the assignment of functions of 
proper officers under Section 2(34) read with Section 5 and the entrustment 
of functions of officers of customs under Section 6 in some instances but 
there can be no scenario in which we can hold that the “functions” under 
Section 6 and Section 2(34) are congruent. 
130. One of the bases for the decision in Canon India (supra) was that no 
entrustment of functions under Section 6 was done in favour of the DRI 

officers. This, however, is a glaring misapplication of Section 6 of the Act 
and is in ignorance of the applicable law which is in fact Sections 2(34) read 
with Section 5 of the Act, 1962. Therefore, in light of the judgment of this 
Court in Yashwant Sinha (supra), we find that it is necessary to allow this 
review petition to do complete justice. ix. 
Observations on the constitutional validity of Section 28 (11) of the Act, 

131. The question as to who are the “proper officers” for the purpose of issuance 
of show cause notices under Section 28 was raised before the High Court of 
Delhi in the case of Mangali Impex (supra). The specific challenge therein 
was to the constitutional validity of Section 28(11) of the Act which was 
inserted by the Customs (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2011 (the 
“Validation Act”) with effect from 16.09.2011. 
132. A Division Bench of the High Court held that sub-section (11) of Section 28 
could not validate the show cause notices issued by the DRI officers prior to 
08.04.2011, i.e., the date when Section 28 was amended. 
133. With a view to understanding the true purport of Section 28(11) and the 
issues pertaining thereto, it is necessary to first examine the changes to 
Section 28 that were introduced prior to the Validation Act. Section 28 as it 
stood prior to the Finance Bill 2011 is reproduced below: 
“28. Notice for payment of duties, interest, etc. (1) 
When any duty has not been levied or has been short-

levied or erroneously refunded, or when any interest 
payable has not been paid, part paid or erroneously 
refunded, the proper officer may,- 
 
(a) in the case of any import made by any individual for 
his personal use or by government or by any 
educational, research or charitable institution or 
hospital, within one year; 
 
(b) in any other case, within six months, 
 
from the relevant date, serve notice on the person 
chargeable with the duty or interest which has not been 
levied or charged or which has been short-levied or part 
paid or to whom the refund has erroneously been made, 
requiring him to show cause why he should not pay the 
amount specified in the notice: 
 
Provided that where any duty has been levied or has 
been short-levied or the interest has not been charged 
or has been part paid or the duty or interest has been 
erroneously refunded by reason of collusion or any 
wilful mis-statement or suppression of facts by the 
importer or the exporter or the agent or employee of the 
importer or exporter, the provisions of this sub-section 
shall have effect as if for the words "one year" and "six 
months", the words "five years" were substituted. 
 
Provided further that where the amount of duty which 
has not been levied or has been short-levied or 
erroneously refunded or the interest payable has not 
been paid, part paid or erroneously refunded is one 
crore rupees or less, a notice under this sub-section 
shall be served by the Commissioner of Customs or with 
his prior approval by any officer sub-ordinate to him: 
 
Provided also that where the amount of duty has not 
been levied or has been short-levied or erroneously 
refunded or the interest payable thereon has not been 
paid, part paid or erroneously refunded is more than 
one crore rupees, no notice under this subsection shall 

be served except with the prior approval of the Chief 
Commissioner of Customs. 
 
Explanation: Where the service of the notice is stayed 
by an order of a court, the period of such stay shall be 
excluded in computing the aforesaid period of one year 
or six months or five years, as the case may be. 

The 
proper 
officer, 
after 
considering the 
representation, if any, made by the person on whom 
notice is served under sub-section (1), shall determine 
the amount of duty or interest due from such person (not 
being in excess of the amount specified in the notice) and 
thereupon such person shall pay the amount so 
determined. 
 
(2A) Where any notice has been served on a person 
under subsection (1), the proper officer – 
 
(i) in case any duty has not been levied or has been 
short-levied, or the interest has not been paid or has 
been part paid or the duty or interest has been 
erroneously refunded by reason of collusion or any 
wilful mis-statement or suppression of facts, where 
it is possible to do so, shall determine the amount of 
such duty or the interest, within a period of one year: 
and 
(ii) in any other case, where it is possible to do so, shall 
determine the amount of duty which has not been 
levied or has been short-levied or erroneously 
refunded or the interest payable which has not been 
paid, part paid or erroneously refunded, within a 
period of six months, 
 
from the date of service of the notice on the person under 
subsection (1). 
 
(2B) Where any duty has not been levied, or has been 
short-levied or erroneously refunded, or any interest 
payable has not been paid, part paid or erroneously 
refunded, the person, chargeable with the duty or the 
interest, may pay the amount of duty or interest before 

service of notice on him under sub-section (1) in respect 
of the duty or the interest, as the case may be, and inform 
the proper officer of such payment in writing, who, on 
receipt of such information, shall not serve any notice 
under sub-section (1) in respect of the duty or the 
interest so paid: 
 
Provided that the proper officer may determine the 
amount of short-payment of duty or interest, if any, 
which in his opinion has not been paid by such person 
and, then, the proper officer shall proceed to recover 
such amount in the manner specified in this section, and 
the period of “one year” or “six months” as the case 
may be, referred to in sub-section (1) shall be counted 
from the date of receipt of such information of payment. 
 
Explanation 2. For the removal of doubts, it is hereby 
declared that the interest under Section 28AB shall be 
payable on the amount paid by the person under this 
sub-section and also on the amount of short-payment of 
duty, if any, as may be determined by the proper officer, 
but for this sub-section. 
 
(2C) The provisions of sub-Section (2B) shall not apply 
to any case where the duty or the interest had become 
payable or ought to have been paid before the date on 
which the Finance Bill 2001 receives the assent of the 
President. 
 
(3) For the purposes of sub-section (1), the expression 
"relevant date" means,- 
 
(a) in a case where duty is not levied, or interest is not 
charged, the date on which the proper officer makes 
an order for the clearance of the goods; 
(b) in a case where duty is provisionally assessed under 
section 18, the date of adjustment of duty after the 
final assessment thereof; 
(c) in a case where duty or interest has been erroneously 
refunded, the date of refund; 
(d) in any other case, the date of payment of duty or interest.” 

134. Thereafter, Section 28 was re-cast and a new scheme of the section was 
introduced vide the Finance Act, 2011 promulgated with effect from 
08.04.2011. Section 28, as it stands after the amendment, is reproduced 
below: 
“28. Recovery of duties not levied or short-levied or 
erroneously refunded. 
(1) Where any duty has not been levied or has been 
short-levied or erroneously refunded, or any interest 
payable has not been paid, part-paid or erroneously 
refunded, for any reason other than the reasons of 
collusion or any wilful mis-statement or suppression of 
facts,- 
(a) the proper officer shall, within one year from the 
relevant date, serve notice on the person chargeable 
with the duty or interest which has not been so levied or 
which has been short-levied or short-paid or to whom 
the refund has erroneously been made, requiring him to 
show cause why he should not pay the amount specified 
in the notice; 
(b) the person chargeable with the duty or interest, may 
pay before service of notice under clause (a) on the basis 
of,- 
(i) his own ascertainment of such duty; or 
(ii) the duty ascertained by the proper officer, the 
amount of duty along with the interest payable thereon 
under section 28AA or the amount of interest which has 
not been so paid or part-paid. 
 
(2) The person who has paid the duty along with interest 
or amount of interest under clause (b) of sub-section (1) 
shall inform the proper officer of such payment in 
writing, who, on receipt of such information shall not 
serve any notice under clause (a) of that sub-section in 
respect of the duty or interest so paid or any penalty 
leviable under the provisions of this Act or the rules 
made thereunder in respect of such duty or interest. 

(3) Where the proper officer is of the opinion that the 
amount paid under clause (b) of sub-section (1) falls 
short of the amount actually payable, then, he shall 
proceed to issue the notice as provided for in clause (a) 
of that sub-section in respect of such amount which falls 
short of the amount actually payable in the manner 
specified under that sub-section and the period of one 
year shall be computed from the date of receipt of 
information under sub-section (2). 
 
(4) Where any duty has not been levied or has been 
short-levied or erroneously refunded, or interest 
payable has not been paid, part-paid or erroneously 
refunded, by reason of,- 
(a) collusion; or 
(b) any wilful mis-statement; or 
(c) suppression of facts, 
 
by the importer or the exporter or the agent or employee 
of the importer or exporter, the proper officer shall, 
within five years from the relevant date, serve notice on 
the person chargeable with duty or interest which has 
not been so levied or which has been so short-levied or 
short-paid or to whom the refund has erroneously been 
made, requiring him to show cause why he should not 
pay the amount specified in the notice. 
 
(5) Where any duty has not been levied or has been 
short-levied or the interest has not been charged or has 
been part-paid or the duty or interest has been 
erroneously refunded by reason of collusion or any 
wilful mis-statement or suppression of facts by the 
importer or the exporter or the agent or the employee of 
the importer or the exporter, to whom a notice has been 
served under sub- section (4) by the proper officer, such 
person may pay the duty in full or in part, as may be 
accepted by him, and the interest payable thereon under 
section 28AA and the penalty equal to twenty five per 
cent. of the duty specified in the notice or the duty so 
accepted by that person, within thirty days of the receipt 
of the notice and inform the proper officer of such 
payment in writing. 

(6) Where the importer or the exporter or the agent or 
the employee of the importer or the exporter, as the case 
may be, has paid duty with interest and penalty under 
sub-section (5), the proper officer shall determine the 
amount of duty or interest and on determination, if the 
proper officer is of the opinion- 

that the duty with interest and penalty has been 
paid in full, then, the proceedings in respect of 
such person or other persons to whom the notice 
is served under sub-section (1) or sub- section (4), 
shall, without prejudice to the provisions of 
sections 135, 135A and 140 be deemed to be 
conclusive as to the matters stated therein; or 

(ii) that the duty with interest and penalty that has 
been paid falls short of the amount actually 
payable, then the proper officer shall proceed to 
issue the notice as provided for in clause (a) of 
sub-section (1) in respect of such amount which 
falls short of the amount actually payable in the 
manner specified under that sub-section and the 
period of one year shall be computed from the 
date of receipt of information under sub-section 
(5). 
 
(7) In computing the period of one year referred to in 
clause (a) of sub-section (1) or five years referred to in 
sub-section (4), the period during which there was any 
stay by an order of a court or tribunal in respect of 
payment of such duty or interest shall be excluded. 
 
(8) The proper officer shall, after allowing the 
concerned person an opportunity of being heard and 
after considering the representation, if any, made by 
such person, determine the amount of duty or interest 
due from such person not being in excess of the amount 
specified in the notice. 
 
(9) The proper officer shall determine the amount of 
duty or interest under sub-section (8),- (a) within six 
months from the date of notice in respect of cases falling 

under clause (a) of sub- section (1); (b) within one year 
from the date of notice in respect of cases falling under 
sub-section (4). 
 
(10) Where an order determining the duty is passed by 
the proper officer under this section, the person liable 
to pay the said duty shall pay the amount so determined 
along with the interest due on such amount whether or 
not the amount of interest is specified separately. 
 
Explanation 1 -- For the purposes of this section, 
"relevant date" means,- 
(a) in a case where duty is not levied, or interest is not 
charged, the date on which the proper officer makes an 
order for the clearance of goods; 
(b) in a case where duty is provisionally assessed under 
section 18, the date of adjustment of duty after the final 
assessment thereof; 
(c) in a case where duty or interest has been erroneously 
refunded, the date of refund; 
(d) in any other case, the date of payment of duty or 
interest. 
 
Explanation 2. - For the removal of doubts, it is hereby 
declared that any non-levy, short-levy or erroneous 
refund before the date on which the Finance Bill, 2011 
receives the assent of the President, shall continue to be 
governed by the provisions of Section 28 as it stood 
immediately before the date on which such assent is 
received.” 
 
135. Parliament, therefore, made changes to the scheme of Section 28 and added 
the Explanation 2 which stated that any non-levy, short-levy or erroneous 
refund before the date of presidential assent to the Finance Bill, 2011 shall 
be governed by the provisions of Section 28 as it stood prior to the 
amendment. 

136. On 06.07.2011, Customs Notification No. 44/2011 was issued under Section 
2(34), which designated inter alia DRI officers as proper officers for the 
purposes of Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 and empowered such 
officers to perform functions under Section 28 including the function of 
issuing show cause notices. 
137. Subsequently, on 16.09.2011, sub-section (11) of Section 28 came to be 
enacted vide the Validation Act. It provided that: 
“(11) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in any judgment, decree or order of any court 
of law, tribunal or other authority, all persons 
appointed as officers of Customs under sub-
section (1) of section 4 before the 6th day of July, 2011 
shall be deemed to have and always had the power of 
assessment under section 17 and shall be deemed to 
have been and always had been the proper officers for 
the purposes of this section.” 
 
138. As stated in the foregoing extract, sub-section (11) was introduced in the 
statute to remedy the defects highlighted by this Court in the case of Sayed 
Ali (supra) and the same retrospectively empowered all officers of customs 
appointed under Section 4(1) before 06.07.2011 to conduct assessments 
under Section 17 of the Act and to be proper officers for the purpose of 
Section 28. 
139. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Validation Act explained that 
the introduction of Section 28(11) was necessary because the position of law 
on the functions of proper officers as interpreted by this Court in Sayed Ali 

(supra) and the consequent invalidation of show cause notices issued by the 
Commissionerates of Customs (Preventive), DRI and others, was not the 
legislative intent. Parliament clarified that show cause notices issued by 
officers of the Commissionerates of Customs (Preventive), DRI, Directorate 
General of Central Excise Intelligence (DGCEI) and Central Excise 
Commissionerates for demanding customs duty not levied or short levied or 
erroneously refunded under Section 28 in respect of goods imported are 
valid, irrespective of whether any specific assignment as proper officer was 
issued. 
140. The Validation Act was first challenged before the High Court of Bombay 
in the case of Sunil Gupta (supra) on the grounds that it is violative of 
Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution and that it fails to take note of 
Explanation 2 to Section 28. Relying on Sayed Ali (supra), the petitioners 
therein challenged the Validation Act on the ground that it is only the 
officers of customs who are assigned functions of assessment including the 
reassessment and they alone are competent to issue notice under Section 28. x. 
Bombay High Court decision in Sunil Gupta (supra) 
 
141. Similar grounds were taken by the petitioners before the High Court of Delhi 
in the case of Mangali Impex (supra) wherein it was submitted that there 
was an apparent conflict between Explanation 2 and Section 28(11) which 
rendered the Validation Act inapplicable to show cause notices issued prior 

to 08.04.2011 i.e., the date on which the new Section 28 came into force. It 
was further submitted that Section 28(11), by conferring powers of the 
proper officer to multiple sets of customs officers without any territorial or 
pecuniary jurisdictional limit, would result in utter chaos and confusion as 
envisaged in Sayed Ali (supra) and therefore, does not cure the defects 
pointed out therein. 
142. The very same argument has been canvassed before us by the respondents 
herein. To comprehensively address the submissions made before us, we 
find it necessary to address the following three issues: 

What is the scope of Explanation 2 to Section 28? 
(ii) Whether the field of operation of Section 28(11) and Explanation 2 
overlaps? In other words, what is the scope of the non-obstante clause 
in sub-section (11)? 
(iii) Whether Section 28(11) cures the defect pointed out in Sayed Ali 
(supra)? 
143. Explanation 2 was introduced as a part of the new Section 28 enacted by the 
Finance Act, 2011 with effect from 08.04.2011. Explanation 2 to Section 28 
reads as follows: 
“Explanation 2. - For the removal of doubts, it is hereby 
declared that any non-levy, short-levy or erroneous 
refund before the date on which the Finance Bill, 2011 
receives the assent of the President, shall continue to be 
governed by the provisions of section 28 as it stood 

immediately before the date on which such assent is 
received.” 
 
144. It was vehemently argued on behalf of the respondents that reading Section 
28(11) with Explanation 2 narrows down the period for the purposes of 
retrospective validation of the show cause notices issued and limits the 
application of sub-section (11) to the period from 08.04.2011 (enactment of 
new Section 28) to 16.09.2011 (enactment of the Validation Act). This 
challenge is based on the reasoning that the non-obstante clause contained 
in Section 28(11) is limited to “…judgment, decree or order of any court of 
law, tribunal or other authority…” and does not oust the application of other 
provisions of the Act including Explanation 2. It was argued that the phrase 
“…this section…” in sub-section (11) when read harmoniously with 
Explanation 2 refers to the new Section 28 only and will not be applicable 
to the old provision as it stood prior to 08.04.2011. 
145. The determination of the soundness of the aforesaid argument necessitates a 
comparison of Section 28, prior to the amendment and subsequent to the 
amendment. 
Provisions of old Section 28 
[running in continuation from 
sub-sections (1) to (3)] 
 
Corresponding provisions of 
new Section 28 
 
Comparison and 
Remarks 
28. Notice for payment of duties, 
interest, etc. 
 
28. Recovery of duties not levied 
or short-levied or erroneously 
refunded. 

(1) When any duty has not been 
levied or has been short-levied or 
erroneously refunded, or when any 
interest payable has not been paid, 
part paid or erroneously refunded, 
the proper officer may, 
 
(a) in the case of any import made 
by any individual for his personal 
use or by government or by any 
educational, 
research 
or 
charitable institution or hospital, 
within one year; 
 
(b) in any other case, within six 
months, from the relevant date, 
serve 
notice 
on 
the 
person 
chargeable with the duty or 
interest which has not been levied 
or charged or which has been 
short-levied or part paid or to 
whom the refund has erroneously 
been made, requiring him to show 
cause why he should not pay the 
amount specified in the notice: 
 
(1) Where any duty has not been 
levied or has been short-levied or 
erroneously refunded, or any 
interest payable has not been paid, 
part-paid 
or 
erroneously 
refunded, for any reason other 
than the reasons of collusion or 
any 
wilful 
mis-statement 
or 
suppression of facts, 
 
(a) the proper officer shall, within 
one year from the relevant date, 
serve 
notice 
on 
the 
person 
chargeable with the duty or 
interest which has not been so 
levied or which has been short-
levied or short-paid or to whom 
the refund has erroneously been 
made, requiring him to show 
cause why he should not pay the 
amount specified in the notice; 

The legislature vide the 
amendment, has removed 
the distinction between 
the purposes for which the 
imports are to be used. 
Sub-section (1)(b) of the 
old 
Section 

is 
analogous to the sub-
section (1)(a) of the new 
Section 28. The only 
change that has been made 
herein is the period of 
limitation for service of 
show cause notice which 
has been increased from 
six months to one year. 
Provided that where any duty has 
been levied or has been short- 
levied or the interest has not been 
charged or has been part paid or 
the duty or interest has been 
erroneously refunded by reason of 
collusion or any wilful mis-
statement or suppression of facts 
by the importer or the exporter or 
the agent or employee of the 
importer 
or 
exporter, 
the 
provisions of this sub-section shall 
have effect as if for the words "one 
year" and "six months", the words 
"five years" were substituted. 
 
(4) Where any duty has not been 
levied or has been short- 
levied or erroneously refunded, or 
interest payable has not been paid, 
part-paid 
or 
erroneously 
refunded, by reason of,- 
(a) collusion; or 
(b) any wilful mis-statement; or 
(c) suppression of facts, by the 
importer or the exporter or the 
agent or employee of the importer 
or exporter, the proper officer 
shall, within five years from the 
relevant date, serve notice on the 
person chargeable with duty or 
interest which has not been so 
levied or which has been so short-
levied or short-paid or to whom 
the refund has erroneously been 
made, requiring him to show 
cause why he should not pay the 
amount specified in the notice. 

(5) Where any duty has not been 
levied or has been short- levied or 
the interest has not been charged 
In respect of the provision 
relating to issuance of 
show cause notice for 
non-levy, short-levy, not-
paid, 
part-paid 
and 
erroneous refund of duty 
by reasons of collusion, 
wilful mis-statement or 
suppression of facts, no 
change has been made and 
the time period of five 
years for service of notice 
has been retained. 
 
The legislature has further 
clarified the procedure 
following the service of 
notice. 
 
Sub-section (5) of the new 
Section 28 provides for 
the levy of interest on the 
amount due and permits 
part-payment 
of 
the 
amount mentioned in the 
notice to the extent that 
the short-fall in duty has 

or has been part- paid or the duty 
or interest has been erroneously 
refunded by reason of collusion or 
any 
wilful 
mis-statement 
or 
suppression of facts by the 
importer or the exporter or the 
agent or the employee of the 
importer or the exporter, to whom 
a notice has been served under 
sub- section (4) by the proper 
officer, such person may pay the 
duty in full or in part, as may be 
accepted by him, and the interest 
payable thereon under section 
28AA and the penalty equal to 
twenty- five per cent of the duty 
specified in the notice or the duty 
so accepted by that person, within 
thirty days of the receipt of the 
notice and inform the proper 
officer of such payment in writing. 

(6) Where the importer or the 
exporter or the agent or the 
employee of the importer or the 
exporter, as the case may be, has 
paid duty with interest and penalty 
under sub-section (5), the proper 
officer shall determine the amount 
of duty or interest and on 
determination, if the proper officer 
is of the opinion- 
 
(i) that the duty with interest and 
penalty has been paid in full, then, 
the proceedings in respect of such 
person or other persons to whom 
the notice is served under sub-
section (1) or sub- section (4), 
shall, without prejudice to the 
provisions of sections 135, 135A 
and 140 be deemed to be 
conclusive as to the matters stated 
therein; or 
 
(ii) that the duty with interest and 
penalty that has been paid falls 
short of the amount actually 
payable, then the proper officer 
shall proceed to issue the notice as 
provided for in clause (a) of sub-
section (1) in respect of such 
been accepted by the 
noticee. 
 
Sub-section (6) of the new 
Section 28 lays down the 
manner in which the 
proceedings following the 
service of the show cause 
notice 
will 
be 
either 
closed on payment of the 
full amount mentioned in 
the notice or adjudication 
and determination of the 
total 
amount 
to 
be 
recovered if part-payment 
has been made by the 
noticee. amount which falls short of the 
amount actually payable in the 
manner specified under that sub-
section and the period of one year 
shall be computed from the date of 
receipt of information under sub-
section (5). 
 
Provided further that where the 
amount of duty which has not been 
levied or has been short-levied or 
erroneously 
refunded 
or 
the 
interest payable has not been paid, 
part paid or erroneously refunded 
is one crore rupees or less, a 
notice under this sub-section shall 
be served by the Commissioner of 
Customs 
or 
with 
his 
prior 
approval by any officer sub-
ordinate to him: 
 
Provided also that where the 
amount of duty has not been levied 
or has been short-levied or 
erroneously 
refunded 
or 
the 
interest payable thereon has not 
been 
paid, 
part 
paid 
or 
erroneously refunded is more than 
one crore rupees, no notice under 
this sub- section shall be served 
except with the prior approval of 
the 
Chief 
Commissioner 
of 
Customs. 

The 
legislature 
has 
removed the pecuniary 
distinction 
and 
the 
consequent 
approvals 
from different authorities 
for issuance of show cause 
notices. 
Explanation: Where the service of 
the notice is stayed by an order of 
a court, the period of such stay 
shall be excluded in computing the 
aforesaid period of one year or six 
months or five years, as the case 
may be. 
 
(7) In computing the period of one 
year referred to in clause 
(a) of sub-section (1) or five years 
referred to in sub-section (4), the 
period during which there was any 
stay by an order of a court or 
tribunal in respect of payment of 
such duty or interest shall be 
excluded. 
 
This is an analogous 
provision. 
(2) The proper officer, after 
considering the representation, if 
any, made by the person on whom 
notice is served under sub-section 
(1), shall determine the amount of 
duty or interest due from such 
person (not being in excess of the 
amount specified in the notice) and 
(8) The proper officer shall, after 
allowing the concerned person an 
opportunity of being heard and 
after 
considering 
the 
representation, if any, made by 
such 
person, 
determine 
the 
amount of duty or interest due 
from such person not being in 
This is an analogous 
provision and pertains to 
the 
adjudication 
/ 
determination 
of 
the 
amount specified in the 
show-cause notice when 
issued under sub-section 
(1) of the new Section 28. thereupon such person shall pay 
the amount so determined. excess of the amount specified in 
the notice. 
 
(2A) Where any notice has been 
served on a person under sub- 
section (1), the proper officer - 
 
(i) in case any duty has not been 
levied or has been short-
levied, or the interest has not 
been paid or has been part 
paid or the duty or interest 
has 
been 
erroneously 
refunded 
by 
reason 
of 
collusion or any wilful mis-
statement or suppression of 
facts, where it is possible to 
do so, shall determine the 
amount of such duty or the 
interest, within a period of 
one year: and 
(ii) in any other case, where it is 
possible to do so, shall 
determine the amount of duty 
which has not been levied or 
has been short-levied or 
erroneously refunded or the 
interest payable which has 
not been paid, part paid or 
erroneously refunded, within 
a period of six months, from 
the date of service of the 
notice on the person under 
sub- section (1). 
 
(9) The proper officer shall 
determine the amount of duty or 
interest under sub-section (8),- 
 
(a) within six months from the date 
of notice in respect of cases falling 
under clause (a) of sub- section 
(1); 
 
(b) within one year from the date 
of notice in respect of cases falling 
under sub-section (4). 
This is an analogous 
provision. 
 
Sub-section (9)(a) of the 
new 
Section 

is 
analogous to sub-section 
(2A)(ii) 
of 
the 
old 
provision and provides for 
a time period of six 
months for adjudication of 
notices issued under new 
Section 28(1)(a). 
 
Sub-section (9)(b) of the 
new 
Section 

is 
analogous to sub-section 
(2A)(i) 
of 
the 
old 
provision and provides for 
a time period of one year 
for adjudication of notices 
issued 
in 
cases 
of 
collusion, 
wilful 
mis-
statement and suppression 
of facts. 
(2B) Where any duty has not been 
levied, or has been short-levied or 
erroneously refunded, or any 
interest payable has not been paid, 
part paid or erroneously refunded, 
the person, chargeable with the 
duty or the interest, may pay the 
amount of duty or interest before 
service of notice on him under sub-
section (1) in respect of the duty or 
the interest, as the case may be, 
and inform the proper officer of 
such payment in writing, who, on 
receipt of such information, shall 
not serve any notice under sub-
section (1) in respect of the duty or 
the interest so paid: 
 
(1) … 
 
(a) … 
 
(b) the person chargeable with the 
duty or interest, may pay before 
service of notice under clause (a) 
on the basis of,- 
 
(i) his own ascertainment of such 
duty; or 
 
(ii) the duty ascertained by the 
proper officer, the amount of duty 
along with the interest payable 
thereon under section 28AA or the 
amount of interest which has not 
been so paid or part-paid. 
In both the old and new 
Section 28, the law has 
provided an opportunity 
to the person chargeable 
with duty or interest to 
make payment before the 
show cause notice is 
issued to him and inform 
the proper officer of such 
payment in writing. 
 
The legislature, in the new 
Section 
28(1)(b) 
has 
clarified the basis for 
ascertainment of amount 
to be paid prior to issuance 
of show cause notice. 

(2) The person who has paid the 
duty along with interest or amount 
of interest under clause (b) of sub-
section (1) shall inform the proper 
officer of such payment in writing, 
who, 
on 
receipt 
of 
such 
information shall not serve any 
notice under clause (a) of that sub-
section in respect of the duty or 
interest so paid or any penalty 
leviable under the provisions of 
this Act or the rules made 
thereunder in respect of such duty 
or interest. 
 
Provided that the proper officer 
may determine the amount of 
short-payment of duty or interest, 
if any, which in his opinion has not 
been paid by such person and, 
then, the proper officer shall 
proceed to recover such amount in 
the manner specified in this 
section, and the period of "one 
year" or "six months" as the case 
may be, referred to in sub-section 
(1) shall be counted from the date 
of receipt of such information of 
payment. 
(3) Where the proper officer is of 
the opinion that the amount paid 
under clause (b) of sub-section (1) 
falls short of the amount actually 
payable, then, he shall proceed to 
issue the notice as provided for in 
clause (a) of that sub-section in 
respect of such amount which falls 
short of the amount actually 
payable in the manner specified 
under that sub-section and the 
period of one year shall be 
computed from the date of receipt 
of information under sub-section 
(2). 
 
These 
provisions 
are 
analogous. 
Explanation 2. For the removal of 
doubts, it is hereby declared that 
the interest under Section 28AB 
shall be payable on the amount 
paid by the person under this sub-
section and also on the amount of 
short-payment of duty, if any, as 
may be determined by the proper 
officer, but for this sub-section. 
 
(10) Where an order determining 
the duty is passed by the proper 
officer under this section, the 
person liable to pay the said duty 
shall 
pay 
the 
amount 
so 
determined along with the interest 
due on such amount whether or 
not the amount of interest is 
specified separately. 
This provision is for the 
recovery of interest. 
(2C) The provisions of sub-Section 
(2B) shall not apply to any case 
where the duty or the interest had 
become payable or ought to have 
been paid before the date on which 
the Finance Bill 2001 receives the 
assent of the President. 

(3) For the purposes of sub-section 
(1), the expression "relevant date" 
means,- 
Explanation 1 - For the purposes 
of this section, "relevant date" 
means,- 
This provision is identical 
to the old provision. 

(a) in a case where duty is not 
levied, or interest is not charged, 
the date on which the proper 
officer makes an order for the 
clearance of the goods; 
 
(b) in a case where duty is 
provisionally 
assessed 
under 
section 18, the date of adjustment 
of duty after the final assessment 
thereof; 
 
(c) in a case where duty or interest 
has been erroneously refunded, 
the date of refund; 
 
(d) in any other case, the date of 
payment of duty or interest." 

(a) in a case where duty is not 
levied, or interest is not charged, 
the date on which the proper 
officer makes an order for the 
clearance of goods; 
 
(b) in a case where duty is 
provisionally 
assessed 
under 
section 18, the date of adjustment 
of duty after the final assessment 
thereof; 
 
(c) in a case where duty or interest 
has been erroneously refunded, 
the date of refund; 
 
(d) in any other case, the date of 
payment of duty or interest. 

Explanation 2. - For the removal 
of doubts, it is hereby declared 
that any non-levy, short-levy or 
erroneous refund before the date 
on which the Finance Bill, 2011 
receives 
the 
assent 
of 
the 
President, shall continue to be 
governed by the provisions of 
Section 28 as it stood immediately 
before the date on which such 
assent is received." 
 
The Explanation 2 was 
added to the new Section 
28 to demarcate the date 
from 
which 
the 
said 
section 
shall 
become 
applicable 
and 
any 
recoveries of duty prior to 
such 
date 
would 
be 
governed 
by 
the 
old 
Section 28. 
 
146. What is discernible from the aforesaid modifications made by the Parliament 
is as under: 
(a) Distinction in the time-period: In sub-section (1) of new Section 28, 
the difference in the purpose of the duty has been removed and for all 
cases of short-levy, non-levy, part-payment, non-payment and 
erroneous refund except for cases falling under new Section 28(4), the 

period of one year has been provided for the service of the show cause 
notice, which under the old provision was six months. 
(b) Additional provision in respect of short-levy, non-levy, part-
payment, non-payment and erroneous refund by reasons of 
collusion, willful misstatement and suppression of facts: An 
additional provision has been inserted by way of Section 28(5) 
stipulating that, to the extent the amount mentioned in the show cause 
notice has been accepted by the person chargeable with payment of 
such duty, the payment of a part of such amount is allowed. 
(c) Self-ascertainment of recovery amount before the issuance of a 
show cause notice: Parliament introduced the mechanism of self-
ascertainment of the recovery amount by the person chargeable with 
the payment of duty and payment of such amounts before the service 
of a show cause notice, subject to final adjudication or determination 
by the proper officer. 
(d) Insertion of Explanation 2: For the removal of doubts regarding the 
applicable provision for recoveries of duty arising before and after the 
enactment of new Section 28, Parliament added Explanation 2 to clarify 
that recoveries arising prior to 08.04.2011 shall be governed by old 
Section 28 of the Act. 

147. Having analysed the aforesaid modifications made by Parliament to old 
Section 28, we can say with certainty that none of the changes made by the 
amendments to Section 28 has any impact on the competence of the proper 
officer for the purposes of fulfilment of functions under Section 28. In our 
considered view, the only major change that warrants the clarification 
provided under Explanation 2 is the distinction with respect to the limitation 
period for the issuance of show cause notices. 
148. Therefore, the application of sub-section (11), which pertains only to the 
empowerment of proper officers to issue show cause notices under Section 
28, cannot be said to be limited only to new Section 28 but also to the 
provision as it stood prior to 08.04.2011. The legislative intent is that sub-
section (11) was meant to apply to Section 28 without any restriction as to 
time. This is apparent from the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 
Validation Act. Therefore, the contention of the respondent that the phrase 
“…this section…” in sub-section (11) means only new Section 28, which 
was also accepted by the High Court of Delhi in Mangali Impex (supra), is 
erroneous. 
149. Since, there is no overlap in the field of operation of Section 28(11) and 
Explanation 2, the interpretation of the non-obstante clause in Section 
28(11) and the consequent harmonious construction of the two provisions in 
Mangali Impex (supra) is otiose. 

150. Thus, we are in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court 
of Bombay in the case of Sunil Gupta (supra) with respect to the first two 
questions raised by us in this case. The relevant portion of that judgment is 
reproduced below: 
“25. As a result of the above discussion and finding that 
Explanation 2 has not been dealing with the case, which 
was specifically dealt with by sub- section (11) of 
section 28 of the Act, that we are of the opinion that the 
challenge in the writ petition is without any merit. The 
Explanation removes the doubts and states that even 
those cases which are governed by section 28 and 
whether initiated prior to the Finance Bill 2011 
receiving the assent of the President shall continue to be 
governed by section 28, as it stood immediately before 
the date on which such assent is received. The reference 
to the Finance Bill therein denotes the Bill by the section 
itself was substituted by Act 8 of 2011 with effect from 
April 8, 2011. Prior to this Bill by which the section was 
substituted receiving the assent of the President of India, 
some cases were initiated and section 28 was resorted 
to by the authorities. Explanation 2 clarifies that they 
will proceed in terms of the unamended provision. The 
position dealt with by insertion of section 28 (11) is 
distinct and that is about competence of the officer. 
The officers namely those from the Directorate of 
Revenue Intelligence having been entrusted and 
assigned the functions as noted above, they are deemed 
to have been possessing the authority, whether in terms 
of section 28 unamended or amended and substituted 
as above. In these circumstances, for these additional 
reasons as well, the challenge to this sub-section must 
fail.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
151. Further, the finding in Mangali Impex (supra) that Section 28(11) is 
overbroad and confers the powers of the proper officer to multiple sets of 

customs officers without any territorial or pecuniary jurisdictional limit 
which in turn may lead to “utter chaos and confusion” as highlighted in 
Sayed Ali (supra), is misconceived in our view. The apprehension of the 
petitioner therein was that plurality of proper officers empowered under 
Section 28 would result in more than one show cause notice and a 
consequent misuse of the provision, which would be detrimental to the 
interests of the persons chargeable with the payment of duty. Although, 
Mangali Impex (supra) declared Section 28(11) to be invalid on this ground, 
it suggested that the Board should issue instructions in its administrative 
capacity that once a show cause notice is issued specifying an adjudicating 
authority subject to such an officer being the proper officer for the purposes 
of Section 28, then he or she alone should proceed to adjudicate that 
particular show cause notice to the exclusion of all other officers who may 
have power in relation to that subject matter. We find this to be a reasonable 
construal of the import and application of Section 28(11). 
152. It is a settled position of law that the possibility of misuse or abuse of a law 
which is otherwise valid cannot be a ground for invalidating it. This 
principle of law has been expounded by this Court in the case of Shreya 
Singhal v. Union of India reported in (2015). The relevant portion 
of the judgment is reproduced below: 
“In The Collector of Customs, Madras v. Nathella 
Sampathu Chetty & Anr., [1962] 3 S.C.R. 786, this 

Court observed: "...This Court has held in numerous 
rulings, to which it is unnecessary to refer, that the 
possibility of the abuse of the powers under the 
provisions contained in any statute is no ground for 
declaring the provision to be unreasonable or void. 
Commenting on a passage in the judgment of the Court 
of Appeal of Northern Ireland which stated: 
"If such powers are capable of being exercised 
reasonably it is impossible to say that they may not 
also be exercised unreasonably" and treating this as 
a ground for holding the statute invalid Viscount 
Simonds observed in Belfast Corporation v. O.D. 
Commission [ 1960 AC 490 at pp. 520-521]: "It 
appears to me that the short answer to this 
contention (and I hope its shortness will not be 
regarded as disrespect) is that the validity of a 
measure is not to be determined by its application to 
particular cases... If it is not so exercised (i.e. if the 
powers are abused) it is open to challenge and there 
is no need for express provision for its challenge in 
the statute." 
The possibility of abuse of a statute otherwise valid 
does not impart to it any element of invalidity. The 
converse must also follow that a statute which is 
otherwise invalid as being unreasonable cannot be 
saved by its being administered in a reasonable 
manner. The constitutional validity of the statute 
would have to be determined on the basis of its 
provisions and on the ambit of its operation as 
reasonably construed. If so judged it passes the test 
of reasonableness, possibility of the powers 
conferred being improperly used is no ground for 
pronouncing the law itself invalid and similarly if 
the law properly interpreted and tested in the light 
of the requirements set out in Part III of the 
Constitution does not pass the test it cannot be 
pronounced valid merely because it is administered 
in a manner which might not conflict with the 
constitutional requirements." (at page 825)” 
[Emphasis supplied] 

153. We were apprised by the learned Additional Solicitor General during the 
course of the hearing that the Customs department has been following the 
protocol suggested in Mangali Impex (supra) since 1999. Further, no 
substantial empirical evidence of the misuse of Section 28(11) which was 
enacted over a decade ago, was presented by the parties. Therefore, we are 
inclined to accept the policy of the Customs department that once a show 
cause notice is issued, the jurisdiction of other empowered proper officers 
shall be excluded for such notice. We find that such policy acts as a sufficient 
safeguard against the apprehension of chaos or confusion or misuse. 
154. Thus, we are of the considered view that the enactment of sub-section (11) 
of Section 28 cures the defect pointed out in Sayed Ali (supra) and the 
judgment in Mangali Impex (supra) deserves to be set aside. 
155. It follows from the above discussion that sub-section (11) of Section 28 is 
constitutionally valid, and its application is not limited to the period between 
08.04.2011 and 16.09.2011. 
156. For the reasons in the foregoing paragraphs, we hold that the Bombay High 
Court judgment in Sunil Gupta (supra) lays down the correct position of 
law, whereas the Delhi High Court decision in Mangali Impex (supra) is 
incorrect and is consequently set aside. xi. 
Amendments made by the Finance Act, 2022 
157. The third cluster of the present batch of cases relates to the challenge to the 
constitutional validity of Sections 86, 87, 88, 94 and 97 of the Finance Act, 
2022 respectively. We take this opportunity to consider this issue as the 
constitutional validity of the said provisions has been challenged with 
specific reference to the findings made in Canon India (supra), which is the 
judgment under review herein. 
158. The validation amendment vide Section 97 has been challenged before this 
Court specifically in WP (C) 526 of 2022 titled Daikin Air Conditioning 
India Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India. The respondent herein has canvassed the 
following grounds for declaring the provision unconstitutional on the 
touchstone of Article 14 of the Constitution: 

The Finance Act, 2022 does not cure the defect pointed out in Canon 
India (supra) and no notification or amendment of law deeming DRI 
officers to be the proper officers would cure the defect of ouster of 
jurisdiction of DRI once the original act of assessment has been 
undertaken by a different group of officers. The Finance Act, 2022 is 
manifestly arbitrary as no attempt has been made to cure the defect 
highlighted in Canon India (supra). 
(ii) This Court in Canon India (supra) made a determination of fact that 
the DRI officers did not have jurisdiction to perform functions under 

Section 28 of the Act, 1962. Such judicial determination of fact relating 
to actual exercise of jurisdiction cannot be retrospectively overruled. 
(iii) The legislature has selectively adhered to the legal findings made in 
Canon India (supra) only for future actions by enactment of Section 
110AA and has proceeded to ignore the findings for past show cause 
notices by validating the same vide Section 97 of the Finance Act, 
2022. Such a distinction creates two classes of assessees without any 
reasonable basis for this differentiation. 
(iv) Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022 fails the test of proportionality as 
it is a sweeping validation of all acts under the chapters specified in the 
section and does not provide certainty to the assessees as to which 
rights have been abrogated. 
(v) The titled Dish TV India 
Ltd. v. Union of India and Ors. has also challenged the application of 
Section 97 on the ground that Section 97(iii) of the Finance Act, 2022 
gives the amendments made to Sections 2, 3 and 5 retrospective effect 
which would make sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 5 applicable to 
the show cause notices issued in the past. It is the case of the writ 
petitioner that Customs Notifications Nos. 44/2011 dated 06.07.2011 
and 40/2012 dated 02.05.2012 do not in any way satisfy the mandatory 
and salutary criteria laid down in Sections 5(4) and 5(5). 

159. From the grounds summarized above, we find that the writ petitioners have 
challenged the constitutionality of the validation of past actions by Section 
97 of the Finance Act, 2022. Therefore, we shall limit our ruling to this 
provision alone. 
160. It is a settled position of law that the legislature is empowered to enact 
validating legislations to validate earlier acts declared illegal and 
unconstitutional by courts by removing the defect or lacuna which led to the 
invalidation of the law. With the removal of the defect or lacuna resulting in 
the validation of any act held invalid by a competent court, the act may 
become valid, if the validating law is lawfully enacted. 
161. This Court in the case of Empire Industries Ltd. v. Union of India reported 
in (1985) observed that: 
“51. In the view we have taken of the expression 
“manufacture”, the concept of process being embodied 
in certain situation in the idea of manufacture, the 
impugned legislation is only making “small repairs” 
and that is a permissible mode of legislation. In 73rd 
vol. of Harvard Law Review p. 692 at p. 795, it has been 
stated as follows: 
“It is necessary that the Legislature should be able 
to cure inadvertent defects in statutes or their 
administration by making what has been aptly 
called “small repairs”. Moreover, the individual 
who claims that a vested right has arisen from the 
defect is seeking a windfall since had the 
legislature's or administrator's action had the 
effect it was intended to and could have had, no 
such right would have arisen. Thus, the interest in 
the retroactive curing of such a defect in the 
administration of government outweighs the 

individual's interest in benefiting from the defect... The Court has been extremely reluctant to 
override the legislative judgment as to the necessity 
for retrospective taxation, not only because of the 
paramount governmental interest in obtaining 
adequate revenues, but also because taxes are not in 
the nature of a penalty or a contractual obligation 
but rather a means of apportioning the costs of 
government among those who benefit from it…” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
162. This Court has laid down the tests for determining whether a validating law 
is enacted within permissible limits in the case of Indian Aluminium 
Company Co. vs. State of Kerala reported in (1996) and the 
relevant observations therein are reproduced below: 
“56. From a resume of the above decisions the following 
salient principles would emerge: 
… 
(3) In a democracy governed by rule of law, the 
Legislature exercises the power under Articles 245 and 
246 and other companion Articles read with the entries 
in the respective Lists in the Seventh Schedule to make 
the law which includes power to amend the law. 
(4) The Court, therefore, need to carefully scan the law 
to find out: (a) whether the vice pointed out by the 
Court and invalidity suffered by previous law is cured 
complying 
with 
the 
legal 
and 
constitutional 
requirements; (b) whether the Legislature has 
competence to validate the law; (c) whether such 
validation is consistent with the rights guaranteed in 
Part III of the Constitution. 
(5) The Court does not have the power to validate an 
invalid law or to legalise impost of tax illegally made 
and collected or to remove the norm of invalidation or 
provide a remedy. These are not judicial functions but 
the exclusive province of the Legislature. Therefore, 
they are not an encroachment on judicial power. 

(6) In exercising legislative power, the Legislature by 
mere declaration, without anything more, cannot 
directly overrule, revise or override a judicial decision. 
It can render judicial decisions ineffective by enacting 
valid law on the topic within its legislative field, 
fundamentally altering or changing its character 
retrospectively. The changed or altered conditions are 
such that the previous decision would not have been 
rendered by the Court, if those conditions had existed 
at the time of declaring the law as including power to 
amend the law. It is also empowered to give effect to 
retrospective legislation with a deeming date or with 
effect from a particular date.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
163. We shall now proceed to determine whether the enactment of Section 97 of 
the Finance Act, 2022 fulfils the tests laid down by this Court for a validation 
Act to be legally sustainable. The first leg of such determination would be 
to satisfy ourselves as to whether Section 97 cures the defect pointed out by 
this Court in Canon India (supra). In this respect, the following aspects are 
relevant: 
a) 
The Coordinate Bench in Canon India (supra) observed that: 
“14. It is well known that when a statute directs that the 
things be done in a certain way, it must be done in that 
way alone. As in this case, when the statute directs that 
“the proper officer” can determine duty not levied/not 
paid, it does not mean any proper officer but that proper 
officer alone. We find it completely impermissible to 
allow an officer, who has not passed the original order 
of assessment, to re-open the assessment on the grounds 
that the duty was not paid/not levied, by the original 
officer who had decided to clear the goods and who was 
competent and authorised to make the assessment. The 
nature of the power conferred by Section 28 (4) to 
recover duties which have escaped assessment is in the 

nature of an administrative review of an act. The section 
must therefore be construed as conferring the power of 
such review on the same officer or his successor or any 
other officer who has been assigned the function of 
assessment. In other words, an officer who did the 
assessment, could only undertake re-assessment [which 
is involved in Section 28 (4)]” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
b) According to Canon India (supra), only “the proper officer” 
empowered to undertake the exercise of assessment or re-assessment 
under Section 17 in a jurisdictional area can perform the functions of 
“the proper officer” under Section 28 of the Act, 1962 as the exercise 
involved in Section 28 is the re-assessment of duty. The defect pointed 
out by the Court in Canon India (supra) is that the DRI officers were 
not “the proper officers” who undertook the exercise of assessment 
under Section 17. Hence, they lacked the jurisdiction to issue show 
cause notices under Section 28. The reasoning given by the Court was 
that any other reading of the expression “proper officers” would lead 
to a multiplicity of proper officers competent to perform functions 
under Section 28, which would result in the perpetuation of chaos and 
confusion as pointed out in Sayed Ali (supra). c) However, the apprehension expressed is unfounded in our opinion 
especially in context of the Customs department’s policy of exclusion 
of jurisdiction of other competent proper officers once a particular 

proper officer empowered to issue a show cause notice under Section 
28 has issued it. Such a policy acts as an adequate safeguard in our 
view. d) We find that the ouster of jurisdiction of DRI to issue show cause 
notices under Section 28 once an assessment has been done under 
Section 17 is not a defect at all in light of Notification No. 44/2011 
dated 06.07.2011 and new Section 17 as amended by the Finance Act, 
2011. We have already recorded a finding in the foregoing segments 
of this judgment that these facts were not considered in Canon India 
(supra) and therefore, become the basis of the review petition herein. e) Notification No. 44/2011 dated 06.07.2011 specifically assigned the 
functions of the proper officers under Sections 17 and 28 to DRI 
officers. Such assignment of functions of assessment is sufficient for 
the DRI officers to fall in the category of “any other officer who has 
been assigned the function of assessment” as mentioned in Canon 
India (supra). f) Furthermore, as discussed previously, the functions of assessment and 
re-assessment under Section 17 and recovery of duty under Section 
28 are distinct. Canon India (supra) held erroneously that Section 
28(4) involves the function of re-assessment. The function of 
recovery of short-levy, non-levy, part-paid, non-paid and erroneous 

refund under Section 28 is not the same as the assessment or re-
assessment of the bill(s) of entry. It necessarily has to be a process 
subsequent to the completion of functions under Section 17. Further, 
such function of determining duty to be recovered requires application 
of judicial mind and therefore, cannot be an administrative review of 
an act. This is especially so after the introduction of self-assessment 
in Section 17 vide the Finance Act, 2011. g) Therefore, the validating provision under Section 97 of the Finance 
Act, 2022 is a mere surplusage with respect to validation of the show 
cause notices issued by DRI officers under Section 28. It cannot be 
challenged on the ground that it does not cure the defect pointed out 
in Canon India (supra) when no defect can be made out therein as a 
result of this review petition. 
164. The contention that Section 97 could not have overruled the finding of fact 
relating to the actual exercise of jurisdiction in Canon India (supra) is 
untenable for the following reasons: 
(a) The argument that once a particular officer has exercised the function 
of assessment, it is a jurisdictional fact that has occurred to the 
exclusion of all other groups in the Customs Department and therefore, 
only that officer or his superiors, who had undertaken assessment under 

Section 17 in the first place, shall have the jurisdiction to issue notices 
for recovery of duty under Section 28, does not hold water. 
(b) As discussed above, the functions of assessment and re-assessment 
under Section 17 and the recovery of duty under Section 28 are distinct. 
Therefore, the exercise of functions under Section 17 can only act as a 
“jurisdictional fact” for the purpose of excluding the jurisdiction of 
other proper officers empowered under that section for the exercise of 
the rest of the functions specified therein. Similarly, the exercise of the 
function of issuing show cause notices under Section 28 by a particular 
proper officer serves as a jurisdictional fact which would exclude the 
jurisdiction of other proper officers empowered under Section 28. 
(c) Canon India (supra) proceeded on an erroneous assumption that the 
jurisdiction of the proper officer under Sections 17 and 28 is linked. 
This is due to the erroneous understanding of the provisions of Act, 
1962 that functions under Section 28 involve re-assessment. 
(d) Therefore, the very basis of the determination of jurisdictional fact for 
exercise of functions under Section 28 has been clarified by us. Thus, 
we are of the considered view that the challenge to Section 97, on the 
ground of inability of a validating Act to overrule a finding of fact, is 
unfounded and liable to be dismissed. 

165. While challenging the constitutional validity, it was argued that the insertion 
of Section 110AA for future actions while validating the past actions (which 
in words of the writ petitioners was contrary to the intent of Section 110AA) 
does not create a reasonable classification as there is no intelligible 
differentia. It was further argued that Section 97 is manifestly arbitrary and 
fails the test of proportionality under Article 14. In our view, these 
submissions are not tenable in law for the following reasons: 
a) 
It is a settled position of law that matters of economic policy are best 
left to the wisdom of the legislature and in policy matters, the accepted 
principle is that the courts should not interfere. This principle has been 
laid down in the case of Bhavesh D. Parish v. Union and India 
reported in (2000), wherein this Court held that: 
“26. The services rendered by certain informal sectors 
of the India economy could not be belittled. However, in 
the path of economic progress, if the informal system 
was sought to be replaced by a more organised system, 
capable of better regulation and discipline, then this 
was an economic philosophy reflected by the legislation 
in question. Such a philosophy might have its merits 
and demerits. But these were matters of economic 
policy. They are best left to the wisdom of the 
legislature and in policy matters the accepted principle 
is that the courts should not interfere. Moreover in the 
context of the changed economic scenario the 
expertise of people dealing with the subject should not 
be lightly interfered with. The consequences of such 
interdiction can have large-scale ramifications and can 
put the clock back for a number of years. The process of 
rationalisation station of the infirmities in the economy 
can be put in serious jeopardy and, therefore, it is 

necessary that while dealing with economic legislations, 
this Court, while not jettisoning its jurisdiction to curb 
arbitrary action or unconstitutional legislation, should 
interfere only in those few cases where the view 
reflected in the legislation is not possible to be taken at 
all.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
b) 
A Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Shri Prithvi Cotton 
Mills Ltd. and Ors. v. Broach Borough Municipality & Ors., reported 
in (1969) set out the modus of validation of tax through 
validating statutes and observed as follows: 
“4. … 
Validation of a tax so declared illegal may be done only 
if the grounds of illegality or invalidity are capable of 
being removed and are in fact removed and the tax thus 
made legal. Sometimes this is done by providing for 
jurisdiction where jurisdiction had not been properly 
invested before. Sometimes this is done by re-enacting 
retrospectively a valid and legal taxing provision and 
then by fiction making the tax already collected to 
stand under the re-enacted law. Sometimes the 
Legislature gives its own meaning and interpretation 
of the law under which tax was collected and by 
legislative fiat makes the new meaning binding upon 
courts. The Legislature may follow any one method or 
all of them and while it does so it may neutralise the 
effect of the earlier decision of the court which becomes 
ineffective after the change of the law. Whichever 
method is adopted it must be within the competence of 
the legislature and legal and adequate to attain the 
object of validation. If the Legislature has the power 
over the subject-matter and competence to make a valid 
law, it can at any time make such a valid law and make 
it retrospectively so as to bind even past transactions. 
The validity of a Validating Law, therefore, depends 
upon whether the Legislature possesses the competence 

which it claims over the subject-matter and whether in 
making the validation it removes the defect which the 
courts had found in the existing law and makes adequate 
provisions in the Validating Law for a valid imposition 
of the tax.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
c) 
We are of the opinion that the introduction of Section 110AA was a 
valid exercise of legislative power to amend the provisions of the Act, 
1962 and it was done with the objective of following the principle of 
comity to give effect to the suggestions of this Court in Sayed Ali 
(supra) and Canon India (supra). However, we clarify that a change 
in law, which the legislature was competent to enact, having 
prospective application cannot be a ground for the writ petitioners to 
question the sanctity and wisdom of the legislature in following a 
different mechanism to assess/re-assess bills of entry(s) and recover 
duty under Sections 17 and 28 respectively. d) 
No occasion arises for us to discuss the validity of Section 97 with 
respect to the test of reasonable classification as the introduction of 
Section 110AA does not create a class of assessees to whom the law 
would apply differentially to, at the same point in time. The differential 
mechanism for the exercise of functions under Section 28 is not for a 
different class of assessees but rather for the show cause notices issued 
during different periods of time that is, prior to the Finance Act, 2022 
and after its enactment. e) 
On the strength of such reasoning, we are of the view that Section 97 
is not manifestly arbitrary and discriminatory and is not disproportional 
to the object sought to be achieved by it. 
166. It is also the contention of the writ petitioners that Section 97 (iii) gives 
retrospective effect to the amendments made in Section 5 thereby making 
previous show cause notices subject to the provisions of the newly inserted 
provisions, i.e., sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 5. It is their case that the 
previous notifications empowering DRI officers to issue show cause notices 
under Section 28 do not fulfil the mandate of Section 5(4) as they cannot be 
placed in any of the criteria envisaged therein. We find no merit in the said 
contention: 
a) 
Section 5(4) reads as follows: 
“(4) In specifying the conditions and limitations 
referred to in sub-section (1), and in assigning functions 
under sub-section (1A), the Board may consider any one 
or more of the following criteria, including, but not 
limited to 
(a) territorial jurisdiction; 
(b) persons or class of persons; 
(c) goods or class of goods; 
(d) cases or class of cases; 
(e) computer assigned random assignment; 
(f) any other criterion as the Board may, by 
notification, specify.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
b) 
From a plain reading of the above-referred sub-section, we find that the 
Board has been entrusted with wide powers in respect of determination 

of criteria and the use of the word “may” is indicative of the Board’s 
discretion in this regard. Therefore, the writ petitioners are wrong in 
construing the sub-section as a mandatory provision for the purpose of 
invalidation of the show cause notices issued. c) 
A purposive interpretation of Section 97 indicates that clause (i) therein 
is the object of its enactment and clause (iii) is an extension thereof to 
further clarify that any deficiencies in law under Sections 2, 3 and 5 of 
the Act, 1962 as they stood prior to the Finance Act, 2022 would not 
be an obstacle to the validating act under clause (i). d) 
Therefore, the retrospective application of Sections 2, 3 and 5 of the 
Act, 1962 respectively is not stand-alone but is restricted to 
achievement of the ultimate object of validation under clause (i) of 
Section 97. Any interpretation of the amended Sections 2, 3 and 5 
arising from the retrospective application thereof, which is contrary to 
or not in furtherance of the Section 97 (i) would not hold good in law. e) 
This Court in the case of Vivek Narayan v. Union of India reported in 
(2023) has held that: 
“140. The principle of purposive interpretation has also 
been expounded through a catena of judgments of this 
Court. A Constitution Bench of this Court in M. Pentiah 
v. Muddala Veeramallappa [M. Pentiah v. Muddala 
Veeramallappa, (1961): AIR 1961 SC 1107] 
was considering a question, as to whether the term 
prescribed in Section 34 would apply to a member of a 
“deemed” committee under the provisions of the 

Hyderabad District Municipalities Act, 1956. An 
argument was put forth that, upon a correct 
interpretation of the provisions of Section 16, the same 
would be permissible. Rejecting the said argument, K. 
Subba Rao, J., observed thus: (AIR pp. 1110-11, para 
6) 
“6. Before we consider this argument in some detail, 
it will be convenient at this stage to notice some of the 
well-established rules of construction which would 
help us to steer clear of the complications created by 
the Act. Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 
10th Edn., says at p. 7 thus: 
‘… if the choice is between two interpretations, the 
narrower of which would fail to achieve the 
manifest purpose of the legislation, we should avoid 
a construction which would reduce the legislation to 
futility and should rather accept the bolder 
construction based on the view that Parliament 
would legislate only for the purpose of bringing 
about an effective result.’…” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
f) 
A seven-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Abhiram Singh v. 
C.D. Commachen (Dead) By Lrs. & Ors., reported in (2017) has held that: 
“36. 
The 
conflict 
between 
giving 
a 
literal 
interpretation or a purposive interpretation to a 
statute or a provision in a statute is perennial. It can 
be settled only if the draftsman gives a long-winded 
explanation in drafting the law but this would result 
in an awkward draft that might well turn out to be 
unintelligible. The interpreter has, therefore, to 
consider not only the text of the law but the context in 
which the law was enacted and the social context in 
which the law should be interpreted. This was 
articulated rather felicitously by Lord Bingham of 
Cornhill in R. (Quintavalle) v. Secy. of State for 
Health [R. (Quintavalle) v. Secy. of State for Health, 
2003 UKHL 13: (2003) 2 AC 687: (2003) 2 WLR 

692 (HL)] when it was said: (AC p. 695 C-H, paras 
8-9) 
“8. The basic task of the court is to ascertain and 
give effect to the true meaning of what Parliament 
has said in the enactment to be construed. But 
that is not to say that attention should be confined 
and a literal interpretation given to the particular 
provisions which give rise to difficulty. Such an 
approach not only encourages immense prolixity 
in drafting, since the draftsman will feel obliged 
to provide expressly for every contingency which 
may possibly arise. It may also (under the banner 
of loyalty to the will of Parliament) lead to the 
frustration 
of 
that 
will, 
because 
undue 
concentration on the minutiae of the enactment 
may lead the court to neglect the purpose which 
Parliament intended to achieve when it enacted the 
statute. Every statute other than a pure 
consolidating statute is, after all, enacted to make 
some change, or address some problem, or 
remove 
some 
blemish, 
or 
effect 
some 
improvement in the national life. The court's task, 
within the permissible bounds of interpretation, is 
to give effect to Parliament's purpose. So the 
controversial provisions should be read in the 
context of the statute as a whole, and the statute 
as a whole should be read in the historical context 
of the situation which led to its enactment.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
g) 
Thus, we are of the opinion that the retrospective application of Section 
5(4) cannot be the basis for the challenge to the validity of Section 97 
of the Finance Act, 2022. 
167. For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the challenge to the constitutional 
validity of the Finance Act, 2022 and more particularly Section 97 thereof, 
being unfounded should fail. We say so more particularly in light of the 

judgment in the review of Canon India (supra) and the various judicial 
pronouncements of this Court. Therefore, we hold that Section 97 of the 
Finance Act, 2022 is constitutionally valid and the challenge to it is rejected 
accordingly. 
F. CONCLUSION 
 
168. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we conclude that: 

DRI officers came to be appointed as the officers of customs vide 
Notification No. 19/90-Cus (N.T.) dated 26.04.1990 issued by the 
Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, Government of India. 
This notification later came to be superseded by Notification No. 
17/2002 dated 07.03.2002 issued by the Department of Revenue, 
Ministry of Finance, Government of India, to account for 
administrative changes. 
(ii) The petition seeking review of the decision in Canon India (supra) is 
allowed for the following reasons: 
a. 
Circular No. 4/99-Cus dated 15.02.1999 issued by the Central 
Board of Excise & Customs, New Delhi which empowered the 
officers of DRI to issue show cause notices under Section 28 of 
the Act, 1962 as well as Notification No. 44/2011 dated 
06.07.2011 which assigned the functions of the proper officer for 

the purposes of Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 respectively 
to the officers of DRI were not brought to the notice of this Court 
during the proceedings in Canon India (supra). In other words, 
the judgment in Canon India (supra) was rendered without 
looking into the circular and the notification referred to above 
thereby seriously affecting the correctness of the same. b. 
The decision in Canon India (supra) failed to consider the 
statutory scheme of Sections 2(34) and 5 of the Act, 1962 
respectively. As a result, the decision erroneously recorded the 
finding that since DRI officers were not entrusted with the 
functions of a proper officer for the purposes of Section 28 in 
accordance with Section 6, they did not possess the jurisdiction to 
issue show cause notices for the recovery of duty under Section 
28 of the Act, 1962. c. 
The reliance placed in Canon India (supra) on the decision in 
Sayed Ali (supra) is misplaced for two reasons – first, Sayed Ali 
(supra) dealt with the case of officers of customs (Preventive), 
who, on the date of the decision in Sayed Ali (supra) were not 
empowered to issue show cause notices under Section 28 of the 
Act, 1962 unlike the officers of DRI; and secondly, the decision 
in Sayed Ali (supra) took into consideration Section 17 of the Act, 

1962 as it stood prior to its amendment by the Finance Act, 2011. 
However, the assessment orders, in respect of which the show 
cause notices under challenge in Canon India (supra) were 
issued, were passed under Section 17 of the Act, 1962 as amended 
by the Finance Act, 2011. 
 
(iii) This Court in Canon India (supra) based its judgment on two grounds: 
(1) the show cause notices issued by the DRI officers were invalid for 
want of jurisdiction; and (2) the show cause notices were issued after 
the expiry of the prescribed limitation period. In the present judgment, 
we have only considered and reviewed the decision in Canon India 
(supra) to the extent that it pertains to the first ground, that is, the 
jurisdiction of the DRI officers to issue show cause notices under 
Section 28. We clarify that the observations made by this Court in 
Canon India (supra) on the aspect of limitation have neither been 
considered nor reviewed by way of this decision. Thus, this decision 
will not disturb the findings of this Court in Canon India (supra) 
insofar as the issue of limitation is concerned. 
(iv) The Delhi High Court in Mangali Impex (supra) observed that Section 
28(11) could not be said to have cured the defect pointed out in Sayed 
Ali (supra) as the possibility of chaos and confusion would continue to 
subsist despite the introduction of the said section with retrospective 

effect. In view of this, the High Court declined to give retrospective 
operation to Section 28(11) for the period prior to 08.04.2011 by 
harmoniously construing it with Explanation 2 to Section 28 of the Act, 
1962. We are of the considered view that the decision in Mangali 
Impex (supra) failed to take into account the policy being followed by 
the Customs department since 1999 which provides for the exclusion 
of jurisdiction of all other proper officers once a show cause notice by 
a particular proper officer is issued. It could be said that this policy 
provides a sufficient safeguard against the apprehension of the issuance 
of multiple show cause notices to the same assessee under Section 28 
of the Act, 1962. Further, the High Court could not have applied the 
doctrine of harmonious construction to harmonise Section 28(11) with 
Explanation 2 because Section 28(11) and Explanation 2 operate in two 
distinct fields and no inherent contradiction can be said to exist between 
the two. Therefore, we set aside the decision in Mangali Impex (supra) 
and approve the view taken by the High Court of Bombay in the case 
of Sunil Gupta (supra). 
 
(v) Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022 which, inter-alia, retrospectively 
validated all show cause notices issued under Section 28 of the Act, 
1962 cannot be said to be unconstitutional. It cannot be said that 
Section 97 fails to cure the defect pointed out in Canon India (supra) 

nor is it manifestly arbitrary, disproportionate and overbroad, for the 
reasons recorded in the foregoing parts of this judgment. We clarify 
that the findings in respect of the vires of the Finance Act, 2022 is 
confined only to the questions raised in the petition seeking review of 
the judgment in Canon India (supra). The challenge to the Finance 
Act, 2022 on grounds other than those dealt with herein, if any, are kept 
open. 
 
(vi) Subject to the observations made in this judgment, the officers of 
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Commissionerates of Customs 
(Preventive), Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence and 
Commissionerates of Central Excise and other similarly situated 
officers are proper officers for the purposes of Section 28 and are 
competent to issue show cause notice thereunder. Therefore, any 
challenge made to the maintainability of such show cause notices 
issued by this particular class of officers, on the ground of want of 
jurisdiction for not being the proper officer, which remain pending 
before various forums, shall now be dealt with in the following manner: 
 
a. 
Where the show cause notices issued under Section 28 of the Act, 
1962 have been challenged before the High Courts directly by way 
of a writ petition, the respective High Court shall dispose of such 

writ petitions in accordance with the observations made in this 
judgment and restore such notices for adjudication by the proper 
officer under Section 28. b. 
Where the writ petitions have been disposed of by the respective 
High Court and appeals have been preferred against such orders 
which are pending before this Court, they shall be disposed of in 
accordance with this decision and the show cause notices 
impugned therein shall be restored for adjudication by the proper 
officer under Section 28. c. 
Where the orders-in-original passed by the adjudicating authority 
under Section 28 have been challenged before the High Courts on 
the ground of maintainability due to lack of jurisdiction of the 
proper officer to issue show cause notices, the respective High 
Court shall grant eight weeks’ time to the respective assessee to 
prefer appropriate appeal before the Customs Excise and Service 
Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT). d. 
Where the writ petitions have been disposed of by the High Court 
and appeals have been preferred against them which are pending 
before this Court, they shall be disposed of in accordance with this 
decision and this Court shall grant eight weeks’ time to the 

respective assessee to prefer appropriate appeals before the 
CESTAT. e. 
Where the orders of CESTAT have been challenged before this 
Court or the respective High Court on the ground of 
maintainability due to lack of jurisdiction of the proper officer to 
issue show cause notices, this Court or the respective High Court 
shall dispose of such appeals or writ petitions in accordance with 
the ruling in this judgment and restore such notices to the 
CESTAT for hearing the matter on merits. f. 
Where appeals against the orders-in-original involving issues 
pertaining to the jurisdiction of the proper officer to issue show 
cause notices under Section 28 are pending before the CESTAT, 
they shall now be decided in accordance with the observations 
made in this decision. 
169. In view of the aforesaid, we allow the titled 
Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. and the connected 
Review Petition Nos. 401/2021, 402/2021 and 403/2021 insofar as the issue 
of jurisdiction of the proper officer to issue show cause notice under Section 
28 is concerned. As discussed, the findings of this Court in Canon India 
(supra) in respect of the show cause notices having been issued beyond the 
limitation period remain undisturbed. 

170. We set aside the decision of the High Court of Delhi rendered in the case of 
Mangali Impex (supra) and uphold the view taken by the High Court of 
Bombay in the case of Sunil Gupta (supra). We also uphold the 
constitutional validity of Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022. 
171. The Registry shall take steps to list the connected civil appeals and writ 
petitions before the appropriate Bench and they shall be disposed in terms 
of the observations made in this judgment. 
172. The review petitions are accordingly disposed of.... CJI.
