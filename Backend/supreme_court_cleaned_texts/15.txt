VIKRAM NATH, J. 

Leave granted. 
 
2. The State of NCT of Delhi1 is in appeal assailing 
the correctness of the order dated 11.02.2021 
passed 

1 GNCTD 

SLP(Crl.) No.2503/2021 

by the High Court of Delhi granting default bail to the 
respondent under section 167(2) of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 19732. 
 
3. Relevant facts for appropriate application of this 
controversy are briefly stated here under: 
 
3.1. A First Information Report3 No.154 of 2020 
was registered on 16.06.2020 with Police 
Station, Special Cell, New Delhi against the 
respondent for offences under Sections 
13/18/20 
of 
the 
Unlawful 
Activities 
(Prevention) Act, 19674, Sections 201/120-B 
of the Indian Penal Code, 18605, Sections 
25/54/59 of the Arms Act, 19596. Pursuant 
to the said FIR, the respondent was arrested 
on 18.06.2020. 
 
3.2. He was initially remanded to Police Custody 
for a period of three days and thereafter to 
Judicial Custody and has since been in 
 
2 CrPC 
3 FIR 
4 UAPA 
5 IPC 
6 The Arms Act 

SLP(Crl.) No.2503/2021 

Mandoli Jail, New Delhi. The period of 90 
days expired on 15th September, 2020. Before 
the expiry of the said period on the request of 
the Investigating Officer7, the time for 
investigation was extended by order dated 
11.09.2020 for a further period of two 
months till 11.11.2020. The investigation 
was not complete till 11.11.2020 and no 
Police report under section 173(2) CrPC was 
filed. 
 
3.3. Before the expiry of the extended period of 
investigation 
which 
was 
valid 
until 
11.11.2020, the Public Prosecutor moved 
another 
application 
dated 
07.11.2020 
requesting for further extension of time for 
investigation for a period of 30 days as per 
the provisions contained in section 43D (2) (b) 
of UAPA. The reasons given for moving the 
said application were manifold which are 
noted as follows: 

7 IO 

SLP(Crl.) No.2503/2021 

i) 
Sanction under section 45(2) of UAPA 
was awaited from GNCTD. ii) 
FSL results of arms recovered from 
accused persons were also awaited; and 
iii) 
Sanction under section 39 of the Arms 
Act was to be obtained. 
 
3.4. The said application was allowed by the Trial 
Court on 10.11.2020 and the period of 
investigation 
was 
further 
extended 
till 
30.11.2020. In the said order of 10.11.2020, 
although all the reasons mentioned in the 
application 
dated 
07.11.2020 
seeking 
extension of the period of investigation were 
mentioned but in the operative portion, the 
Trial Court noted that the extension had been 
sought on the ground of obtaining mandatory 
sanction which was still pending before the 
GNCT Delhi and had accordingly granted the 
extension till 30.11.2020. The investigation 
has since been completed and Police report 
under section 173(2) CrPC was submitted on 
26.11.2020 before the expiry of the period of 

SLP(Crl.) No.2503/2021 

extension for concluding the investigation up 
to 30.11.2020. 
 
3.5. The respondent moved an application on 
11.11.2020 itself under section 167 of the 
CrPC for release on bail. The said application 
was rejected by the Trial Court vide order 
dated 17.11.2020. Aggrieved by the same, the 
respondent preferred a petition under section 
482 CrPC for setting aside the order dated 
11.09.2020 and 10.11.2020 which was 
registered as Crl. M.C. No.2312 of 2020. This 
petition has since been allowed by the 
impugned order giving rise to the present 
appeal. 
 
4. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we 
are of the view that the High Court committed an 
error in allowing the petition and granting default 
bail to the respondent. In this connection, the 
High Court had relied upon the judgment in the 
case of Hitendra Vishnu Thakur and others vs. 
The State of Maharashtra and others8 wherein 
 
8 (1994) 

SLP(Crl.) No.2503/2021 

this Court was dealing with the provisions of 
section 20(4) (bb) of the Terrorist and Disruptive 
Activities (Prevention) Act, 19879 and had 
observed that the period for granting extension of 
investigation could not be extended in a casual 
manner for reasons other than those mentioned 
in the above noted provision which stated that it 
could be for completion of investigation only. 
 
5. Reliance placed upon the said judgment in the 
case of Hitendra Vishnu Thakur (supra) by the 
Delhi High Court was misplaced. It was a case 
relating to TADA, whereas the present case 
related to UAPA. The provisions under UAPA 
section 43D(2)(b) are different and give other 
reasons 
also 
for 
extension 
of 
time 
for 
investigation. Section 43D(2) reads as under: 
“43D. Modified application of certain 
provisions of the Code.- 

 Notwithstanding anything contained 
in the Code or any other law, every offence 
punishable under this Act shall be deemed 
to be a cognizable offence within the 
meaning of clause (c) of section 2 of the 
Code, and “cognizable case” as defined in 
that clause shall be construed accordingly. 
 
9 TADA 

SLP(Crl.) No.2503/2021 

Section 167 of the Code shall apply in 
relation to a case involving an offence 
punishable under this Act subject to the 
modification that in sub-section (2),- 

 the references to “fifteen days”, 
“ninety days” and “sixty days”, wherever 
they 
occur, 
shall 
be 
construed 
as 
references to “thirty days”, “ninety days” 
and “ninety days” respectively; and 

 After the proviso, the following 
provisos shall be inserted, namely: - 
 
“Provided further that if it is not possible 
to complete the investigation within the 
said period of ninety days, the Court may 
if it is satisfied with the report of the Public 
Prosecutor indicating the progress of the 
investigation and the specific reasons for 
the detention of the accused beyond the 
said period of ninety days, extend the said 
period up to one hundred and eighty days: 
Provided also that if the police officer 
making the investigation under this Act, 
requests, for the purposes of investigation, 
for police custody from judicial custody of 
any person in judicial custody, he shall file 
an affidavit stating the reasons for doing so 
and shall also explain the delay, if any, for 
requesting such police custody. xxxxxx 
 
” 

SLP(Crl.) No.2503/2021 

6. From a perusal of the above provision i.e. 43 
D(2)(b), the extension for investigation could be 
granted up to a maximum period of 180 days for 
the following reasons: 
 
• Completion of the investigation; 
• Progress in the investigation was explained; 
and 
• Specific reasons for detention beyond a period 
of 90 days. 
 
7. Provisions of section 43D(2)(b) were considered 
by this Court in the case of State of 
Maharashtra vs. Surendra Pundlik Gadling 
and others10. In the said case, the FSL report 
was awaited and it also required the detention of 
the accused wherein financial details of the 
respondent were still being ascertained in view of 
the huge conspiracy spreading over a number of 
cities were being investigated. The High Court 
failed to take into consideration the above 
judgment of 2019 relating to UAPA. It had relied 
 
10 (2019) 

SLP(Crl.) No.2503/2021 

upon a judgment of 1994 relating to provisions of 
TADA. 
 
8. The High Court also committed an error in 
recording a finding that sanction had already 
been received prior to the date of making the 
application for extension in November 2020. The 
recording of the said fact is not correct. The 
Public Prosecutor in the application had clearly 
mentioned that the sanction under section 45(1) 
of UAPA had been obtained from Government of 
India, Ministry of Home Affairs and was attached 
with the case file. However, the sanction under 
section 45(2) of UAPA was awaited from GNCT 
Delhi and that the sanction under section 39 of 
the Arms Act was to be obtained after the results 
from the FSL was received. 
 
9. We are, therefore, of the view that the reason 
mentioned in the impugned order that the 
application had been filed for extension without 
any valid basis as the sanction had already been 
granted, was not correct. 

SLP(Crl.) No.2503/2021 

10. The High Court also fell in error in not taking into 
consideration the reasons given under section 
43D(2) (b) were clearly made out and explained 
in the extension letter dated 07.11.2020 giving 
the details of the progress of the investigation as 
also the reasons for detaining the respondent. 
The Public Prosecutor had mentioned in the 
request that major investigation of the case had 
been completed and the draft chargesheet had 
been prepared. However, for want of remaining 
sanctions and FSL report some more time was 
required for completing the investigation. 
 
11. Insofar as the reasons for detention are 
concerned, it was mentioned that during the 
course of investigation one Mr. Gurtej Singh had 
been arrested who had links with Pakistan based 
terrorists and had been planning to go to 
Pakistan for weapons training along with his 
associate respondent No.2 Rajkumar alias Lovely 
and others. 
 
12. The High Court also failed to consider that after 
completing the investigation, Police report under 

SLP(Crl.) No.2503/2021 

section 173(2) CrPC had already been submitted 
prior to 30.11.2020 which was the last date of the 
extended period. 
 
13. One more aspect to be considered is the nature 
of offence which involved terrorist activities 
having not only Pan India impact but also impact 
on other enemy States. The matter should not 
have been taken so lightly. 
 
14. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The impugned 
order passed by the High Court is set aside. The 
respondent No.2 be taken into custody forthwith, 
if not already in custody.
