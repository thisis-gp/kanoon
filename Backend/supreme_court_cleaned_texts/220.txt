A.M. MOHAN 

VERSUS 
 
THE STATE REPRESENTED BY SHO 
AND ANOTHER 

JUDGMENT 
 
B.R. GAVAI, J. 

1. 
Leave granted. 
2. 
The present appeal challenges the order dated 15th July 
2022 passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of 
Judicature at Madras in 
and Crl. M.P. No. 8763 of 2020, whereby the High Court 
rejected the petition filed by the present appellant under 
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 
(“Cr.P.C.” for short), to call for the records and to quash the 
First Information Report (“FIR” for short) registered as Crime 
No. 21 of 2020, on the file of SHO, District Crime Branch, 
Kancheepuram, in connection with the offence punishable 

under Section 420 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 
1860 (“IPC” for short). 
FACTS 
3. 
Shorn of details, the facts leading to the present appeal 
are as under: 
3.1 The case of the prosecution is that, during the year 
2016, accused No. 2-Suresh Prathaban, being a college 
friend, approached the complainant Karthick Krishnamurthy 
for some help to clear his hand loan. The accused No. 2 
further told that he had business with accused No. 1-
Lakshmanan, who is running a hotel and also doing real 
estate business. Upon the insistence of accused No. 2, the 
complainant had agreed to extend financial help to accused 
No. 1 to the tune of Rs.1,60,00,000/- for the business 
project(s) at Oragadam and around Kancheepuram District 
with condition to repay the same within 20 months with 
100% profit. 
3.2 Accordingly, the complainant transferred a sum of 
Rs.49,25,000/- on 18th March 2016, Rs.20,01,000/- on 31st 
May 
2016, 
Rs.36,25,000/- 
on 
13th 
June 
2016, 
Rs.30,24,166/- on 8th July 2016 through RTGS and Rs. 

24,25,834/- in cash to accused Nos. 1 and 2, totalling to the 
tune of Rs.1,60,01,000/- (though mentioned in complaint as 
Rs.1,60,00,000/-). To secure the same, accused No. 1 had 
executed a registered simple mortgage deed dated 18th March 
2016 in favour of the complainant relating to 100 plots at 
Sumangali Village, Thiruvannamalai District, registered vide 
document No.768 of 2016 for Rs.1,00,00,000/-. 
3.3 Thereafter, at the insistence of accused Nos. 1 and 2, 
the complainant entered into an unregistered memorandum 
of understanding and paid a sum of Rs.1,50,00,000/- and a 
further sum of Rs.50,00,000/- by RTGS and cheque to 
accused No. 1’s bank. In the said amount, the complainant 
directly transferred a sum of Rs.20,00,000/- in favour of the 
present appellant-A.M. Mohan (accused No.3). Further, 
accused No.1 also transferred a sum of Rs.1,80,00,000/- to 
the present appellant for the purchase of the land 
admeasuring 9.80 acres situated at Chittoor Village, 
Sriperumbudur Taluk. To secure the said payment of 
Rs.2,00,00,000/- with returns of Rs.10,00,00,000/-, accused 
No. 1 executed a registered deed of General Power of Attorney 
(“GPA” for short) dated 3rd February 2017, in favour of the 

complainant, vide document No. 3733/2017, in respect of 
the above said land and also executed a registered sale deed 
relating to the land admeasuring 2.52 acres situated at 
Vellarai Village, Kancheepuram District vide document 
No.386/2017 dated 9th February 2017 in favour of the 
complainant. 
3.4 The accused No. 1 also executed a mortgage deed for 
land admeasuring 2.14 acres at Sunguvarchatram Village 
(though mentioned in the complaint as ‘a registered 
Agreement to Sell land admeasuring 1.64½ acres’) in favour 
of the complainant registered vide document No.373/2017 
dated 27th February 2017. Thereafter, accused Nos. 1 and 2 
had received an amount of Rs.49,85,500/- and executed 
unregistered loan agreement dated 5th March 2017, in favour 
of the complainant and agreed to repay with interest 
quantified at Rs.60,000/- per month. For repayment of the 
said amount along with interest, accused No. 1 had given a 
cheque for Rs.58,50,000/- and the same was returned 
dishonoured due to insufficient funds. 
3.5 Apart from all these transactions, on insistence of 
accused Nos. 1 and 2, the complainant joined in the “gold 

chit business” conducted by accused No. 1 and paid a sum of 
Rs.1,20,000/- per month, from March 2016 to August 2017, 
totalling to the tune of Rs.21,60,000/-. The accused persons 
swindled all the amounts and cheated the complainant. The 
accused No. 1 had disposed of about 58 plots on his own and 
failed to return the mortgaged amount of Rs.1,00,00,000/- 
with interest. He also cancelled the power of attorney 
standing in favour of the complainant relating to 9.80 acres 
of land at Chittoor Village and without notice to the 
complainant, he sold out the same to third parties. 
Accordingly, the appellant and other accused persons 
cheated the complainant to the tune of Rs.16,01,00,000/- 
(though mentioned in complaint as Rs.16,06,00,000/-) by 
their willful and intentional action of fraud, cheating and 
criminal breach of trust. Hence the complaint. 
3.6 On the strength of the complaint filed before the 
Judicial Magistrate, a FIR being Crime No. 21 of 2020 came 
to be registered on 7th November 2020, at District Crime 
Branch, Kancheepuram District, against accused Nos. 1, 2 
and 3, for the offences punishable under Section 420 read 
with 34 of the IPC. 

3.7 Aggrieved thereby, the appellant herein filed a Criminal 
O.P. No. 20716 of 2020 before the High Court, under Section 
482 of the Cr.P.C., to call for the records and to quash the 
said FIR. 
3.8 Vide impugned order dated 15th July 2022, the learned 
Single Judge of the High Court, observed that it is clear that 
the intention of the appellant and other accused persons was 
only to cheat the complainant and that it can be seen from 
the FIR that there are specific allegations against the 
appellant to attract the offence, which has to be investigated 
in depth. 
3.9 The Single Judge held that the FIR discloses prima facie 
commission of a cognizable offence and as such, the High 
Court cannot interfere with the investigation. As a result, the 
High Court rejected the petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for quashing of the FIR, but directed the investigating agency 
to complete the investigation and file a final report within a 
period of twelve weeks. 
3.10 Aggrieved thereby, the appellant filed the present 
appeal, in which notice came to be issued vide order dated 
21st October 2022. 

3.11 As per the additional documents filed in this Court, the 
charge-sheet in relation to the subject FIR, came to be filed 
on 4th January 2023. 
4. 
We have heard Shri S. Nagamuthu, learned Senior 
Counsel appearing for the appellant, Shri V. Krishnamurthy, 
learned Senior Additional Advocate General (AAG) for 
respondent No. 1 and Shri G. Ananda Selvam, learned 
counsel appearing for respondent No. 2. 
SUBMISSIONS 
5. 
Shri Nagamuthu, learned Senior Counsel appearing on 
behalf of the appellant submits that even if the averments 
made in the FIR are taken at their face value, no case is 
made out for the offence punishable under Section 420 of 
IPC against the present appellant. It is further submitted 
that a reading of the charge-sheet would reveal that none of 
the ingredients to attract the provision of Section 420 of IPC 
could be found therein. 
6. 
Shri Nagamuthu, relying on various judgments of this 
Court, submits that, for attracting the offence of ‘cheating’ as 
defined under Section 415 of IPC and punishable under 
Section 420 of IPC, it is necessary that the FIR should make 

out a case of “intentional inducement”, “dishonesty” or 
“fraudulence”. It is submitted that for the offence of 
‘cheating’, there should not only be cheating, but as a 
consequence of such cheating, the accused should also have 
dishonestly induced the person deceived to deliver any 
property to a person. It is submitted that neither the FIR nor 
the charge-sheet contain a whisper with respect to any 
inducement, fraud or dishonesty qua the appellant that 
caused the complainant to deliver the sum of Rs.20,00,000/- 
to his bank account on 2nd February 2017. 
7. 
Shri 
Nagamuthu 
further 
submitted 
that 
the 
complainant has deliberately suppressed the fact that the 
appellant had transferred the land in favour of accused No. 1 
by way of a Sale Deed dated 3rd February 2017 i.e., on the 
very next day of receiving the sum of Rs.20,00,000/- from 
the complainant. It is further submitted that, on the very 
same day i.e. 3rd February 2017, accused No. 1 had executed 
a GPA in favour of the complainant vide Document No. 3733 
of 2017. The GPA specifically states that the complainant 
had received the GPA in respect of the land purchased by 
accused No. 1 from the appellant. It is therefore submitted 

that the appellant has no role to play after 3rd February 2017 
and almost all the allegations are with regard to cancellation 
of GPA etc., and execution of subsequent sale deed in favour 
of accused No. 4-Seeralan and accused No. 5-Kavitha by 
accused No. 1, are not related to the appellant. 
8. 
As against this, Shri G. Ananda Selvam, learned 
counsel appearing for respondent No. 2 submits that since 
the charge-sheet has already been filed, the appeal is 
rendered infructuous. It is submitted that the appellant can 
very well file an application for discharge. It is further 
submitted that the averments in the FIR would clearly show 
that the present appellant along with other accused persons 
has cheated the complainant and defrauded with the huge 
amount. It is therefore submitted that no interference is 
warranted in the present appeal. 
CONSIDERATION 
9. 
The law with regard to exercise of jurisdiction under 
Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash complaints and criminal 
proceedings has been succinctly summarized by this Court 
in the case of Indian Oil Corporation v. NEPC India 

Limited 
and 
Others1 
after 
considering 
the 
earlier 
precedents. It will be apposite to refer to the following 
observations of this Court in the said case, which read thus: 
“12. The 
principles 
relating 
to 
exercise 
of 
jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure to quash complaints and 
criminal 
proceedings 
have 
been 
stated 
and 
reiterated by this Court in several decisions. To 
mention 
a 
few—Madhavrao 
Jiwajirao 
Scindia v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre [(1988): 1988 SCC (Cri) 234], State of 
Haryana v. Bhajan Lal [1992 Supp (1) SCC 335: 
1992 SCC (Cri) 426], Rupan Deol Bajaj v. Kanwar 
Pal Singh Gill [(1995): 1995 SCC (Cri) 
1059], Central Bureau of Investigation v. Duncans 
Agro Industries Ltd. [(1996): 1996 SCC 

1045], State 
of 
Bihar v. Rajendra 
Agrawalla [(1996): 1996 SCC (Cri) 628], Rajesh Bajaj v. State NCT of Delhi [(1999): 1999 SCC (Cri) 401], Medchl Chemicals & 
Pharma (P) Ltd. v. Biological E. Ltd. [(2000): 2000 SCC (Cri) 615], Hridaya Ranjan Prasad 
Verma v. State of Bihar [(2000): 2000 
SCC (Cri) 786], M. Krishnan v. Vijay Singh [(2001): 2002 SCC (Cri) 19] and Zandu 
Pharmaceutical 
Works 
Ltd. v. Mohd. 
Sharaful 
Haque [(2005): 2005 SCC (Cri) 283]. 
The principles, relevant to our purpose are: 
(i) A complaint can be quashed where the 
allegations made in the complaint, even if 
they are taken at their face value and 
accepted in their entirety, do not prima 
facie constitute any offence or make out 
the case alleged against the accused. 
For this purpose, the complaint has to be examined 
as a whole, but without examining the merits of the 
allegations. Neither a detailed inquiry nor a 
 
1 (2006): 2006 INSC 452 

meticulous 
analysis 
of 
the 
material 
nor 
an 
assessment of the reliability or genuineness of the 
allegations in the complaint, is warranted while 
examining prayer for quashing of a complaint. 
(ii) A complaint may also be quashed 
where it is a clear abuse of the process of 
the 
court, 
as 
when 
the 
criminal 
proceeding is found to have been initiated 
with mala 
fides/malice 
for 
wreaking 
vengeance or to cause harm, or where the 
allegations are absurd and inherently 
improbable. 
(iii) The power to quash shall not, 
however, be used to stifle or scuttle a 
legitimate prosecution. The power should 
be used sparingly and with abundant 
caution. 
(iv) The complaint is not required to 
verbatim reproduce the legal ingredients 
of the offence alleged. If the necessary 
factual 
foundation 
is 
laid 
in 
the 
complaint, merely on the ground that a 
few ingredients have not been stated in 
detail, the proceedings should not be 
quashed. Quashing of the complaint is 
warranted only where the complaint is so 
bereft of even the basic facts which are 
absolutely necessary for making out the 
offence. 
(v) A given set of facts may make out: (a) 
purely a civil wrong; or (b) purely a 
criminal offence; or (c) a civil wrong as 
also a criminal offence. A commercial 
transaction or a contractual dispute, 
apart from furnishing a cause of action 
for seeking remedy in civil law, may also 
involve a criminal offence. As the nature 
and scope of a civil proceeding are 
different from a criminal proceeding, the 
mere fact that the complaint relates to a 
commercial transaction or breach of 

contract, for which a civil remedy is 
available or has been availed, is not by 
itself a ground to quash the criminal 
proceedings. The test is whether the 
allegations in the complaint disclose a 
criminal offence or not. 
13. While on this issue, it is necessary to take 
notice of a growing tendency in business circles to 
convert purely civil disputes into criminal cases. 
This is obviously on account of a prevalent 
impression that civil law remedies are time 
consuming and do not adequately protect the 
interests of lenders/creditors. Such a tendency is 
seen in several family disputes also, leading to 
irretrievable 
breakdown 
of 
marriages/families. 
There is also an impression that if a person could 
somehow be entangled in a criminal prosecution, 
there is a likelihood of imminent settlement. Any 
effort to settle civil disputes and claims, which do 
not involve any criminal offence, by applying 
pressure through criminal prosecution should be 
deprecated 
and 
discouraged. 
In G. 
Sagar 
Suri v. State of U.P. [(2000): 2000 SCC 
(Cri) 513] this Court observed: (SCC p. 643, para 8) 
“It is to be seen if a matter, which is 
essentially of a civil nature, has been 
given a cloak of criminal offence. Criminal 
proceedings are not a short cut of other 
remedies available in law. Before issuing 
process a criminal court has to exercise a 
great deal of caution. For the accused it 
is a serious matter. This Court has laid 
certain principles on the basis of which 
the 
High 
Court 
is 
to 
exercise 
its 
jurisdiction under Section 482 of the 
Code. Jurisdiction under this section has 
to be exercised to prevent abuse of the 
process of any court or otherwise to 
secure the ends of justice.” 
14. While no one with a legitimate cause or 
grievance 
should 
be 
prevented 
from 
seeking 

remedies available in criminal law, a complainant 
who initiates or persists with a prosecution, being 
fully aware that the criminal proceedings are 
unwarranted and his remedy lies only in civil law, 
should himself be made accountable, at the end of 
such 
misconceived 
criminal 
proceedings, 
in 
accordance with law. One positive step that can be 
taken 
by 
the 
courts, 
to 
curb 
unnecessary 
prosecutions and harassment of innocent parties, is 
to exercise their power under Section 250 CrPC 
more frequently, where they discern malice or 
frivolousness or ulterior motives on the part of the 
complainant. Be that as it may.” 

10. The Court has also noted the concern with regard to a 
growing tendency in business circles to convert purely civil 
disputes into criminal cases. The Court observed that this is 
obviously on account of a prevalent impression that civil law 
remedies are time consuming and do not adequately protect 
the interests of lenders/creditors. The Court also recorded 
that there is an impression that if a person could somehow 
be entangled in a criminal prosecution, there is a likelihood 
of imminent settlement. The Court, relying on the law laid 
down by it in the case of G. Sagar Suri and Another 
v. State of U.P. and Others2 held that any effort to settle 
civil disputes and claims, which do not involve any criminal 
offence, by applying pressure through criminal prosecution 
 
2 (2000): 2000 INSC 34 

should be deprecated and discouraged. The Court also 
observed that though no one with a legitimate cause or 
grievance should be prevented from seeking remedies 
available in criminal law, a complainant who initiates or 
persists with a prosecution, being fully aware that the 
criminal proceedings are unwarranted and his remedy lies 
only in civil law, should himself be made accountable, at the 
end 
of 
such 
misconceived 
criminal 
proceedings, 
in 
accordance with law. 
11. This Court, in the case of Prof. R.K. Vijayasarathy 
and Another v. Sudha Seetharam and Another3 has 
culled out the ingredients to constitute the offence under 
Sections 415 and 420 of IPC, as under: 
“15. Section 415 of the Penal Code reads thus: 
“415. Cheating.—Whoever, by deceiving 
any person, fraudulently or dishonestly 
induces the person so deceived to deliver 
any property to any person, or to consent 
that any person shall retain any property, 
or intentionally induces the person so 
deceived to do or omit to do anything 
which he would not do or omit if he were 
not so deceived, and which act or 
omission causes or is likely to cause 
damage or harm to that person in body, 
mind, reputation or property, is said to 
“cheat”.” 
 
3 (2019): 2019 INSC 216 

16. The ingredients to constitute an offence of 
cheating are as follows: 
16.1. There should be fraudulent or dishonest 
inducement of a person by deceiving him: 
16.1.1. The 
person 
so 
induced 
should 
be 
intentionally induced to deliver any property to any 
person or to consent that any person shall retain 
any property, or 
16.1.2. The 
person 
so 
induced 
should 
be 
intentionally induced to do or to omit to do anything 
which he would not do or omit if he were not so 
deceived; and 
16.2. In cases covered by 16.1.2. above, the act or 
omission should be one which caused or is likely to 
cause damage or harm to the person induced in 
body, mind, reputation or property. 
17. A fraudulent or dishonest inducement is an 
essential ingredient of the offence. A person who 
dishonestly induces another person to deliver any 
property is liable for the offence of cheating. 
18. Section 420 of the Penal Code reads thus: 
“420. Cheating 
and 
dishonestly 
inducing 
delivery 
of 
property.—
Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly 
induces the person deceived to deliver 
any property to any person, or to make, 
alter or destroy the whole or any part of a 
valuable security, or anything which is 
signed or sealed, and which is capable of 
being converted into a valuable security, 
shall be punished with imprisonment of 
either description for a term which may 
extend to seven years, and shall also be 
liable to fine.” 
19. The ingredients to constitute an offence under 
Section 420 are as follows: 
19.1. A person must commit the offence of cheating 
under Section 415; and 

19.2. The person cheated must be dishonestly 
induced to 
(a) deliver property to any person; or 
(b) make, alter or destroy valuable 
security or anything signed or sealed and 
capable of being converted into valuable 
security. 
20. Cheating is an essential ingredient for an act to 
constitute an offence under Section 420.” 
 
12. A similar view has been taken by this Court in the cases 
of Archana Rana v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another4, 
Deepak Gaba and Others v. State of Uttar Pradesh and 
Another5 and Mariam Fasihuddin and Another v. State 
by Adugodi Police Station and Another6. 
13. It could thus be seen that for attracting the provision of 
Section 420 of IPC, the FIR/complaint must show that the 
ingredients of Section 415 of IPC are made out and the 
person cheated must have been dishonestly induced to 
deliver the property to any person; or to make, alter or 
destroy valuable security or anything signed or sealed and 
capable of being converted into valuable security. In other 
words, for attracting the provisions of Section 420 of IPC, it 
must be shown that the FIR/complaint discloses: 
 
4 (2021): 2021 INSC 135 
5 (2023): 2023 INSC 1 
6: 

the deception of any person; 

fraudulently or dishonestly inducing that person to 
deliver any property to any person; and 
(iii) dishonest intention of the accused at the time of 
making the inducement. 
14. The averments with regard to the present appellant as 
have been found in the FIR is as under: 
“At the instance of the said Lakshmanan (accused 
No.1), I (complainant) paid directly Rs. 20,00,000/- 
to one Mohan (appellant-accused No. 3) and the 
said Lakshmanan (accused No.1) transferred the 
remaining sale consideration of over 18 odd crores 
to Mohan for the purchase of his lands at 
Sunguvarchatram. But suppressed the execution of 
sale 
deed 
dated 
03.02.2017 
by 
the 
appellant/accused No.3.” 
 
15. A perusal thereof would reveal that even in the said 
averments, the allegation with regard to inducement is only 
qua accused No. 1. We have perused the entire FIR. Except 
the aforesaid allegations, there are no other allegation with 
regard to the present appellant-accused No. 3. The rest of 
the allegations are against accused No. 1 (Lakshmanan). 
Even the allegations with regard to inducement are only 
against accused Nos. 1 and 2. 

16. Not only that, even in the charge-sheet, the only role 
attributed to the present appellant could be found as follows: 
“Thereafter, A2 had lured the complainant once 
again saying that A1 is going to layout the 9.80 acre 
land in Chittoor Village, Thiruperumbudur Taluk, 
which is under A3’s general power of attorney and 
that the complainant would gain huge profits if he 
invests Rs. 2 crores in this project as well. A1 too, 
as he had already done, lured the complainant that 
he would pay him a share out of the profit, and 
executed a General Power of Attorney Deed in 
favour of the complainant in respect of the 9.80 acre 
land in Chittoor Village in Thiruperumbudur Taluk 
which he purchased from A3 and registered it as 
Doc. No. 3733/2017 in Sunguvarchattiram Sub 
Registrar Office on 03.02.2017, in a manner 
instilling confidence in the complainant. 
…….. 
Moreover, upon instructions from A1 to transfer Rs. 
20,00,000/- to A3’s Tamil Nadu Mercantile Bank 
Account towards sale of the land made by A3 to A1, 
the complainant had transferred online a sum of 
Rs.20,00,000/- to A3’s Tamil Nadu Mercantile Bank 
Account 
from 
his 
Yes 
Bank 
Account 
on 
02.02.2017.” 
 
17. It could thus be seen that the only allegation against the 
present appellant is that accused No. 1 executed the GPA in 
favour of the complainant in respect of the land which is 
purchased from the present appellant-accused No.3. The 
other allegation is that upon instructions of accused No. 1 to 
transfer Rs. 20,00,000/- to accused No. 3’s Tamil Nadu 
Mercantile Bank Account towards sale of the land made by 

the appellant-accused No.3 to accused No.1, the complainant 
had transferred online a sum of Rs.20,00,000/-. 
18. It is an undisputed position that upon receipt of the 
said amount of Rs.20,00,000/-, the present appellant had 
transferred the land in question by sale deed in favour of 
accused No.1. It is also undisputed that thereafter accused 
No. 1 executed the GPA in favour of the complainant on the 
same day. After the sale deed was executed in favour of 
accused No.1 by the appellant-accused No.3, though the 
complaint narrates various instances thereafter, no role is 
attributed to the present appellant. 
19. At the cost of repetition, it has to be noted that no role 
of inducement at all has been attributed to the present 
appellant. Rather, from the perusal of the FIR and the 
charge-sheet, it would reveal that there was no transaction of 
any 
nature 
directly 
between 
the 
appellant 
and 
the 
complainant. The version, if accepted at its face value, would 
reveal that, at the instance of accused No. 1, the complainant 
transferred the amount of Rs.20,00,000/- in the account of 
the appellant. On receipt of the said amount, the appellant 
immediately executed the sale deed in favour of accused 

No.1, who thereafter executed the GPA in favour of the 
complainant. After that, no role is attributed to the present 
appellant and whatever happened thereafter, has happened 
between accused No. 1, the complainant and the other 
accused persons. In that view of the matter, we find that the 
FIR or the charge-sheet, even if taken at its face value, does 
not disclose the ingredients to attract the provision of Section 
420 of IPC qua the appellant. 
20. The dishonest inducement is the sine qua non to attract 
the provisions of Sections 415 and 420 of IPC. In our 
considered view, the same is totally lacking qua the present 
appellant. In that view of the matter, we find that 
continuation of the criminal proceedings against the present 
appellant would be nothing else but amount to abuse of 
process of law resulting in miscarriage of justice. 
21. Insofar as the contention of the respondents that since 
the charge-sheet has been filed, the present appeal is liable 
to be dismissed, is concerned, it will be relevant to refer to 
the following observations of this Court, in the case of Anand 

Kumar Mohatta and Another v. State (NCT of Delhi), 
Department of Home and Another7: 
“14. First, 
we 
would 
like 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
submission of the learned Senior Counsel for 
Respondent 2 that once the charge-sheet is filed, 
petition for quashing of FIR is untenable. We do not 
see any merit in this submission, keeping in mind 
the position of this Court in Joseph Salvaraj 
A. v. State of Gujarat [Joseph Salvaraj A. v. State of 
Gujarat, (2011): (2011) 3 SCC (Cri) 23]. 
In Joseph Salvaraj A. [Joseph Salvaraj A. v. State of 
Gujarat, (2011): (2011) 3 SCC (Cri) 23], 
this Court while deciding the question whether the 
High Court could entertain the Section 482 petition 
for quashing of FIR, when the charge-sheet was filed 
by the police during the pendency of the Section 
482 petition, observed: (SCC p. 63, para 16) 
“16. Thus, from the general conspectus of 
the various sections under which the 
appellant is being charged and is to be 
prosecuted would show that the same are 
not made out even prima facie from the 
complainant's FIR. Even if the charge-
sheet had been filed, the learned Single 
Judge [Joesph Saivaraj A. v. State of 
Gujarat, 2007 SCC OnLine Guj 365] 
could have still examined whether the 
offences alleged to have been committed 
by the appellant were prima facie made 
out from the complainant's FIR, charge-
sheet, documents, etc. or not.” 
15. Even otherwise it must be remembered that the 
provision invoked by the accused before the High 
Court is Section 482 CrPC and that this Court is 
 
7 (2019): 2018 INSC 1060 

hearing an appeal from an order under Section 482 
CrPC. Section 482 CrPC reads as follows: 
“482. Saving of inherent powers of the 
High Court.—Nothing in this Code shall 
be deemed to limit or affect the inherent 
powers of the High Court to make such 
orders as may be necessary to give effect 
to any order under this Code, or to 
prevent abuse of the process of any court 
or otherwise to secure the ends of 
justice.” 
16. There is nothing in the words of this section 
which restricts the exercise of the power of the 
Court to prevent the abuse of process of court or 
miscarriage of justice only to the stage of the 
FIR. It is settled principle of law that the High 
Court can exercise jurisdiction under Section 
482 CrPC even when the discharge application is 
pending with the trial court [G. Sagar Suri v. State 
of U.P., (2000), para 7: 2000 SCC (Cri) 
513. Umesh Kumar v. State of A.P., (2013), para 20: (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 338: (2014) 2 
SCC (L&S) 237]. Indeed, it would be a travesty to 
hold that proceedings initiated against a person 
can be interfered with at the stage of FIR but 
not if it has advanced and the allegations have 
materialised 
into 
a 
charge-sheet. 
On 
the 
contrary it could be said that the abuse of 
process caused by FIR stands aggravated if the 
FIR has taken the form of a charge-sheet after 
investigation. 
The 
power 
is 
undoubtedly 
conferred to prevent abuse of process of power 
of any court.” 
[emphasis supplied] 

22. A similar view has been taken by this Court in the case 
of Haji Iqbal alias Bala through S.P.O.A. v. State of U.P. and Others8. 
23. In that view of the matter, contention in this regard has 
no merit. 
CONCLUSION 
24. In the result, we are inclined to allow the appeal. The 
order of the High Court dated 15th July 2022 in Criminal O.P. 
No.20716 of 2020 and is 
quashed and set aside. The FIR in Crime No.21 of 2020 and 
the consequential charge-sheet filed against the present 
appellant shall stand quashed and set aside. 
25. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
