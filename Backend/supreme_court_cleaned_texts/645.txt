MANDAKINI DIWAN AND ANR. 
 …APPELLANTS 
VERSUS 
THE HIGH COURT OF 
CHHATTISGARH & ORS. …RESPONDENTS 
 
JUDGMENT 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 
1. Leave granted. 
2. This appeal assails the correctness of the order 
dated 10.05.2023 passed by the Division Bench of 
High Court of Chhattisgarh in W.P.Cr. No.197 of 
2016 titled as Mandakini Diwan & Anr. vs. High 
Court of Chhattisgarh and seven others whereby 
the writ petition was dismissed with liberty to the 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

petitioners therein (appellants herein) to avail the 
appropriate remedy before the appropriate forum. 
3. Before referring to the facts we wish to make it clear 
that we are not entering into the detailed facts and 
submissions as advanced by the parties because 
any observation made by us on such submissions 
and detailed facts may result into influencing a fair 
investigation which we are inclined to direct in the 
present case by an independent agency. 
4. The facts giving rise to the present appeal are: 
4.1. The respondent no.7 had applied in the Higher 
Judicial Services of the State of Chhattisgarh 
against the advertisement issued in the year 2012. 
Pursuant to which he was selected and appointed 
in June 2013 as Addl.District Judge, Geedam at 
Dantewada. Respondent no.7 got married to the 
deceased on 15.02.2014. However, they had known 
each other since 2010. The deceased was working 
as Asstt. District Prosecution Officer. At the 
relevant time they were posted at Dantewada. 
4.2. On 12.05.2016, in the evening at about 10:30 PM 
the appellants who are mother and the brother of 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

the deceased received a phone call that Ms. 
Ranjana 
Diwan 
had 
committed 
suicide. 
Immediately 
they 
rushed 
from 
Bilaspur 
to 
Dantewada and tried to figure out as to what had 
happened. According to the appellants they were 
not provided with the post mortem report. 
4.3. It is the case of the appellants that there was 
something fishy in the death of Ms. Ranjana Diwan 
and it was not a case of simple suicide. It was also 
their apprehension that respondent no.7 having 
sufficient influence being a senior judicial officer 
had managed the post mortem in which the cause 
of death was shown to be suicide by hanging. 
4.4. The post-mortem report further indicated that the 
deceased had six ante-mortem injuries on her body. 
The information of suicide was given to the 
Dantewada Police Station, a Merg was registered 
under section 174 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 
19731. On 13.05.2016, the police made recoveries, 
the copy of which is filed as Annexure -P/2. The 
 
1 CrPC 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

post mortem was conducted on 13.05.2016 at 
06:30 PM. The cause of death was reported to be 
asphyxia due to hanging. Further, six ante mortem 
injuries were reported which are as follows: 
“Injuries: 
 
1) A contusion present over back of right hand ~ 
3.5 cm x 3 cm bluish. 
 
2) A contusion present over left ring finger over 
proximal phalanx palmer aspect, ~ 1.5 cm x 1 
cm, bluish. 
 
3) A contusion present over right leg~ 3 cm below 
knee~ 4 cm x 3.5 cm, bluish. 
 
4) A contusion present over the left foot dorsal 
aspect ~ 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm bluish. 
 
5) A contusion present over left thigh ~ 17 cm 
below groin, ~ 4 cm x 4.3 cm bluish. 
 
6) Ligature mark: A brown parchment like hard 
ligature mark present over neck above the 
level of thyroid cartilage, obliquely extending 
upward toward chin, from behind, grooved at 
places. Maximum breadth ~ 4.5 cm on the 
backside. Peeling of skin evident in marks at 
places. Mark is situated 1.5 cm below tip of 
chin, 5.5 cm below tip of left mastoid, & 4 cm 
below tip of right mastoid, 10 cm below 
occiput. Mark is faint for ~3 cm on the right 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

side. On dissection corresponding under the 
surface of skin is glistering white. Hyoid bone 
and thyroid cartilage intact. 
 
All the injuries are ante mortem and are of 
within 06 hours of death. Injury no.6 is 
sufficient to cause instantaneous death in the 
ordinary course of nature. 
 
Metallic rings in each 2nd toe.” 
 
4.5. According to the appellants, the Police filed the 
closure report treating it to be a case of suicide. The 
appellants repeatedly continued to represent to the 
authorities for a fair investigation after registering 
First Information Report. All the complaints made 
by the appellants to the authorities did not result 
in the registering of FIR against respondent no.7. 
All the complaints though were inquired into but 
were ultimately closed as a result of the influence 
exerted by the respondent no.7. Till date, neither 
FIR has been registered on the several complaints 
made by the appellants nor a fair investigation has 
been carried out in order to find out the truth. 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

4.6. Left with no alternative, the appellants filed writ 
petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of 
India registered as W.P. Crl. No.197 of 2016 praying 
for the following reliefs: 
“10.1 That, this Hon'ble Court may be kind 
enough in issuing a writ in the nature of 
mandamus, certiorari of likewise any other 
appropriate writ commanding and directing 
the respondents to produce all the records 
related with the case of the petitioners for just 
and proper decision of this case. 
 
10.2 That, this Hon'ble Court may be kind 
enough in issuing a writ in the nature of 
mandamus, certiorari or likewise any other 
appropriate writ, commanding and directing 
the respondent No. 8 to lodge a separate FIR 
or to take investigation of merg No. 24/16 of 
the 
Police 
Station, 
Geedam, 
District 
Dantewada and after due investigation the 
report may kindly be submitted before the 
Hon'ble Court. 
 
10.3 That, this' Hon'ble Court may be kind 
enough to issuing a writ in the nature of 
mandamus, certiorari or likewise any other 
appropriate writ, commanding and· directing 
respondents No.2 to 6 to hand over all the 
records related with the case of death of 
deceased Ranjana Diwan, wife of Manvendra 
Singh, the respondent No. 7 for just and 
proper investigation, enquiry into the matter. 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

10.4 That, this Hon'ble Court may be kind 
enough in issuing a writ in the nature of 
mandamus, certiorari or likewise any other 
appropriate writ, commanding and directing 
the respondent No. 1 to keep the respondent 
No. 7 out of the job till the final decision of the 
case so that there may be no influence In the 
investigation by the respondent No. 7. 
 
10. 5 Any other relief, which the Hon'ble 
Court deems fit and proper looking to the facts 
and circumstances of the case, may also be 
granted.” 
 
4.7. In the petition before the High Court, respondent 
no.1 is the High Court of Chhattisgarh, respondent 
no.2 is State of Chhattisgarh through Secretary, 
Department of Home, respondent no.3 is the 
Director General of Police, respondent no.4 is 
Inspector 
General 
of 
Police 
Headquarters, 
respondent no.5 is Superintendent of Police, 
Dantewada, respondent no.6 is Station House 
Officer, Police Station Geedam, District Dantewada, 
respondent no.7 is the husband of the deceased 
and respondent no.8 is the Central Bureau of 
Investigation. 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

4.8. The said petition remained pending for about seven 
years. By the impugned order the High Court has 
dismissed the said petition. According to the High 
Court the appellants had adequate statutory 
remedy available under section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. by approaching the Magistrate concerned. 
 
5. The submissions advanced by the counsel for the 
appellants is that it is true that appellant had a 
remedy of filing a complaint under section 156(3) 
Cr.P.C. but considering the fact that the respondent 
no.7 is senior judicial officer and had already 
exercised his influence on the administration in 
ensuring that FIR is not registered and no free and 
fair investigation be carried out, they had little hope 
rather no hope of getting any justice from the Court 
of a Magistrate who would be an officer subordinate 
to respondent no.7. It is for this reason that they 
had approached the High Court under Article 226 
of the Constitution of India. 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

6. Before us, detailed arguments have been advanced 
by the appellants to show the high handedness of 
the 
respondent 
no.7 
in 
influencing 
the 
administration in not registering the FIR despite 
there being suspicious circumstances resulting in 
the death of daughter of the appellant no.1 and 
sister of appellant no.2, more particularly there 
being no explanation for the six ante mortem 
injuries. It was therefore submitted that this Court 
may direct for an independent agency to investigate 
into the matter. 
7. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for 
State of Chhattisgarh submitted that detailed 
inquiry was carried out and statements of more 
than 50 witnesses were recorded; that every 
complaint filed by the appellant was enquired into 
at the highest level but when no evidence could be 
found against respondent no.7, the complaints 
were closed. It is also his submission that the 
appellants 
are 
unnecessarily 
doubting 
the 
credibility of the investigating agency of the State of 
Chhattisgarh and it also amounts to putting a 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

blame not only on the respondent no.7 but also on 
the entire police machinery of the State of 
Chhattisgarh. 
8. Learned counsel also referred to the details as to 
how the complaints have been dealt with. It was 
thus submitted that the appeal be dismissed and 
the appellants be left at liberty to approach the 
Magistrate under section 156(3) Cr.P.C. 
9. Learned 
senior 
counsel 
appearing 
for 
the 
respondent no.7 also had similar submissions as 
were made on behalf of the State of Chhattisgarh. 
In addition, it was submitted that respondent no.7 
being a judicial officer having a good reputation is 
being unnecessarily targeted by the appellants for 
ulterior motives. A very thorough and fair inquiry 
was carried out in which no complicity of the 
respondent no.7 could be found. 
10. It was further submitted that in all the enquiries 
made, no incriminating material could be collected 
against the respondent no.7 and as such the 
complaints were rightly closed. By filing the writ 
petition and the present appeal the only attempt of 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

the appellants is to somehow or the other not only 
tarnish the image of the respondent no.7 but also 
cause unnecessary harassment and jeopardize his 
service. Further, a direction to appoint CBI to 
investigate is also not warranted in the present case 
and the appeal deserves to be dismissed. 
11. Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General 
appearing for the CBI submitted that whatever 
order the Court passes the same would be complied 
with. He also suggested that the Court may 
consider 
appointing 
a 
high-level 
Special 
Investigation Team or in the alternative may direct 
the CBI to investigate the matter as this will provide 
credibility and instill confidence not only in the 
aggrieved party but also in the society at large. 
12. Considering the fact that the respondent no.7 is a 
senior judicial officer any doubt or apprehension in 
the minds of the appellants who have lost their 
family 
member 
may 
be 
dispelled 
by 
the 
investigation being carried out by CBI. This may 
result into doing complete justice and enforcing the 
fundamental right of getting a fair investigation. 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

13. In 
the 
case 
of 
Awungshi 
Chirmayo 
vs. 
Government of NCT of Delhi2 this Court directed 
CBI to hold enquiry in the criminal matter related 
to murder of two cousins due to certain puzzling 
facts including inconclusive post mortem report. It 
held as follows: 
“13. In a seminal judgment reported as 
State of West Bengal v. Committee for 
Protection of Democratic Rights, West 
Bengal, (2010), this Court has 
discussed 
in 
detail 
inter 
alia 
the 
circumstances 
under 
which 
the 
Constitutional 
Courts 
would 
be 
empowered to issue directions for CBI 
enquiry to be made. This Court noted that 
the power to transfer investigation should 
be used sparingly, however, it could be 
used for doing complete justice and 
ensuring 
there 
is 
no 
violation 
of 
fundamental rights. This is what the Court 
said in Para 70: 
“Insofar as the question of issuing a 
direction 
to 
CBI 
to 
conduct 
investigation in a case is concerned, 
although no inflexible guidelines can 
be laid down to decide whether or not 
such power should be exercised but 
time and again it has been reiterated 
that such an order is not to be passed 
as a matter of routine or merely 
 
2 (2022) SCC Online SC 1452 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

because a party has levelled some 
allegations against the local police. 
This extraordinary power must be 
exercised sparingly, cautiously and in 
exceptional 
situations 
where 
it 
becomes 
necessary 
to 
provide 
credibility and instil confidence in 
investigations or where the incident 
may have national and international 
ramifications or where such an order 
may be necessary for doing complete 
justice and enforcing the fundamental 
rights…” 
 
14. The powers of this Court for directing 
further investigation regardless of the 
stage of investigation are extremely wide. 
This can be done even if the chargesheet 
has been submitted by the prosecuting 
agency. In the case of Bharati Tamang v. 
Union of India, (2013), this 
Court allowed the Writ Petition filed by the 
widow of late Madan Tamang who was 
killed during a political clash and directed 
investigation by the CBI which would be 
monitored by the Joint Director, CBI. The 
following observations were made in Para 
44: 
“44. Whether it be due to political 
rivalry or personal vengeance or for 
that matter for any other motive a 
murder 
takes 
place, 
it 
is 
the 
responsibility of the police to come up 
to the expectation of the public at 
large and display that no stone will 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

remain unturned to book the culprits 
and bring them for trial for being dealt 
with under the provisions of the 
criminal law of prosecution. Any 
slackness displayed in that process 
will not be in the interest of public at 
large and therefore as has been 
pointed out by this Court in the 
various decisions, which we have 
referred to in the earlier paragraphs, 
we find that it is our responsibility to 
ensure that the prosecution agency is 
reminded of its responsibility and 
duties in the discharge of its functions 
effectively and efficiently and ensure 
that the criminal prosecution is 
carried 
on 
effectively 
and 
the 
perpetrators 
of 
crime 
are 
duly 
punished by the appropriate court of 
law.” 
 
15. This Court has expressed its strong 
views about the need of Courts to be alive 
to genuine grievances brought before it by 
ordinary citizens as has been held in 
Zahira Habibulla H. Sheikh v. State of 
Gujarat, (2004). 
 
16. It is to observe that unresolved crimes 
tend to erode public trust in institutions 
which 
have 
been 
established 
for 
maintaining law and order. Criminal 
investigation must be both fair and 
effective. We say nothing on the fairness of 
the investigation appears to us, but the 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

fact that it has been ineffective is self 
evident. The kith and kin of the deceased 
who live far away in Manipur have a real 
logistical 
problem 
while 
approaching 
authorities in Delhi, yet they have their 
hope alive, and have shown trust and 
confidence in this system. We are therefore 
of the considered view that this case needs 
to be handed over to CBI, for a proper 
investigation and also to remove any 
doubts in the minds of the appellants, and 
to bring the real culprits to justice. 
 
17. In view of the discussion made above, 
the order of the Delhi High Court dated 
18.05.2018, dismissing the prayer of the 
present 
appellants 
to 
transfer 
the 
investigation to CBI is hereby set aside. 
The appeal is hereby allowed and we direct 
that CBI to hold enquiry in the matter. The 
case shall be transferred from SIT to the 
CBI. The SIT, which has so far conducted 
the investigation in the matter, will hand 
over all the relevant papers and documents 
to CBI for investigation. After a thorough 
investigation, CBI will submit its complete 
investigation report or charge sheet before 
the concerned court as expeditiously as 
possible.”” 
 
14. It is true that power to direct CBI to conduct 
investigation is to be exercised sparingly and such 
orders should not be passed in routine manner. In 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

the present case, the aggrieved party has raised 
allegations of bias and undue influence on the 
police machinery of the State of Chhattisgarh. 
Coupled with the fact that the thorough, fair and 
independent investigation needs to be carried out 
to find out the truth about the whole incident and 
in particular about the ante mortem injuries. We 
are of the view that such a direction needs to be 
issued in the present case. 
15. We accordingly allow this appeal, set aside the 
impugned order passed by the High Court and 
further direct the CBI-respondent no.8 to carry out 
complete and fair investigation and proceed in 
accordance to law into the incident and that too 
expeditiously considering the fact that the incident 
is of 2016 and submit a report to this Court. If the 
CBI finds that an FIR needs to be registered, it may 
itself do so and proceed accordingly and bring such 
complaint to a logical conclusion. However, if the 
CBI comes to the conclusion that there is no 
material which it could collect which is not 
sufficient 
in 
ordinary 
course 
to 
submit 
a 

SLP(CRL.) NO.12649 OF 2023 

chargesheet, it would close the proceedings. The 
State of Chhattisgarh is directed to extend all 
cooperation 
to 
the 
CBI 
in 
conducting 
the 
investigation and provide all necessary papers and 
other strategic support to the CBI as may be 
required. 
16. We make it clear that we have not made any 
observation on merit. However, still we clarify that 
any observation made in this judgment will not 
influence the investigation by the CBI. The appeal 
is accordingly allowed.
