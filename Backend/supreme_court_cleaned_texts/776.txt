CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS. OF 2024 
(pecial Leave to Petition (Crl.) Nos.16282-
16284 of 2023) 
 
SHYAM NARAYAN RAM 
VERSUS 
STATE OF U.P. & ANR. ETC.. RESPONDENT(S) 

J U D G E M E N T 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 
 
1. Leave granted. 
2. By means of these appeals, the informant-
appellant has assailed the correctness of the 
judgment and order dated 01.11.2023 passed by 
the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Appeal 
Nos.4982/2019, 5346/2019 and 5347/2019 
whereby the High Court allowed the appeals, set 
aside the order of conviction passed by the Trial 
Court dated 15/16th July, 2019 and had 
remanded the matter to the Trial Court to decide 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

the same afresh and that the matter be retried 
from the stage of testimony of PW 2 onwards. 
Further a direction was issued that the authors 
of the exhibited documents liable to establish the 
authenticity of the same would be cross-
examined by the defence, and that the trial would 
proceed on day to day basis and shall conclude 
on or before 31st May, 2024. Further, the 
appellants before the High Court were to be 
released on bail on furnishing personal bonds 
and two heavy sureties each of the like amount 
to the satisfaction of the court concerned. They 
were further liable to give additional affidavit to 
the Trial Court concerned, that they would 
remain present on every day or as and when 
required by the Trial Court. It was further 
directed that the fine amount imposed by the 
Trial Court would remain stayed during the 
period of trial and would remain subject to final 
verdict to be pronounced by the Trial Court. 
3. Brief facts giving rise to the present appeals are: 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

3.1 First Information Report1 was lodged on 
22.04.1998 at 05.30 am by the appellant which 
was registered as FIR bearing No.27/1998, Police 
Station 
Dhanapur, 
District 
Chandauli, 
U.P.under section 302/34 of the Indian Penal 
Code, 18602 and 3(1)(v) of the SC/ST Act. 
According to the prosecution story, on the 
intervening night of 21/22.04.1998 the appellant 
(PW 1), Ram Dular (PW2) who were harvesting 
crops in the fields, on hearing gunshots, rushed 
to the pumping set from where the shots were 
being fired and saw that the four accused namely 
Radhey Shyam Lal A-1, Pratap A-2, Rajesh 
Kumar appu A-3 and Jagannath A-4 were 
assaulting the parents of the appellant namely 
Bodha Devi and Mohan Ram who belonged to 
Scheduled Caste. After brutally assaulting the 
two deceased, they threw their bodies into the 
well. 
3.2 Upon registration of the FIR, the police came to 
the site and with the help of the villagers, pulled 
out the two dead bodies of parents of the 
 
1 FIR 
2 IPC 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

appellant from the well. An inquest was prepared 
and their bodies were thereafter sent for post-
mortem. The deceased Bodha Devi had suffered 
seven injuries all over her body including a fatal 
wound on the back of the chest extending upto 
the neck measuring 48 cm x 28 cm. The cause of 
death was recorded as due to the fracture in the 
vertebra and injury to the spinal cord. The post-
mortem of the deceased Mohan Ram disclosed as 
many as sixteen injuries which included eleven 
lacerated wounds and the cause of death was 
reported as death due to injuries to spine and 
spinal cord. 
3.3 The Investigating Officer recovered blood soaked 
gamcha (scarf) belonging to accused Pratap (A-2), 
licensed SBBL gun with two live cartridges. From 
the place of occurrence, the Investigating Officer 
also recovered three empty-shell-casings of 12 
bore, 1 live 12 bore cartridge, cardboard and 
plastic rods, tikli and other remnants of spent 
cartridges, apart from other standard recoveries. 
The recovered articles were sent to the forensic 
laboratory and as per the report one out of the 
three cartridges has been found to have been 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

fired from the seized licensed SBBL gun. The FSL 
report further confirmed that in the barrel of the 
seized SBBL gun, there was residue of firing. 
Further, the presence of lead and nitrate clearly 
indicated that the gun had been recently used. 
4. After completing the investigation charge-sheet 
was submitted. The Magistrate concerned took 
cognizance and thereafter committed the case to 
the Sessions Court for trial. The charges were 
read out to the four accused who denied the same 
and claimed to be tried. 
5. The 
prosecution 
examined 
the 
informant-
appellant as PW 1 and the other eye-witness Ram 
Dular as PW 2 and also filed the relevant 
documents. 
Counsel 
for 
the 
defence 
on 
28.04.2005 admitted the genuineness of the 
prosecution documents and dispensed with its 
formal proof. The Public Prosecutor had filed an 
application under section 311 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 19733 for summoning the 
formal witnesses which was opposed by the 
defence. The Trial Court, after recording the 
 
3 CrPC 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

submissions 
and 
the 
admission 
of 
the 
prosecution documents by the defence counsel, 
exhibited the prosecution papers which had not 
been exhibited. Further, the Trial Court closed 
the prosecution evidence and fixed 4th May, 2005 
for recording the statement of the accused under 
section 313 CrPC. The statements of all the 
accused were recorded under section 313 CrPC 
on 4th May, 2005 and later on because of a few 
incriminating circumstances which were not put 
to the accused, a supplementary statement was 
also recorded under section 313 CrPC. Despite 
the statement under section 313 CrPC was 
recorded as far back as May, 2005, the trial could 
not proceed further, apparently as the same was 
stayed by the High Court. The trial, however, 
further commenced in 2019. 
6. At this stage also the Public Prosecutor pressed 
upon the court for consideration of their 
applications 29 kha and 30 kha for summoning 
Dr.S.K.Srivastava, who had conducted the 
autopsy on the dead bodies of the two deceased, 
and the Investigating Officer to prove the 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

recovery memos etc. These applications were 
also seriously objected to by the defence. 
7. The Trial Court, vide judgment and order dated 
15/16th July, 2019 convicted all the four accused 
and sentenced them to life imprisonment under 
section 302 IPC and other ancillary sentences for 
the rest of the offences and all of them to run 
concurrently. The accused were taken into 
custody on the date of the judgment. 
8. Aggrieved by their conviction and sentence, the 
four accused preferred three separate appeals 
before the High Court. Appeal No.4982/2019 
was preferred by Rajesh Kumar appu, 
5346/2019 was preferred by Radhey Shyam Lal 
and 5347/2019 was preferred by Pratap and 
Jagannath. The High Court, by the impugned 
judgment and order dated 1st November, 2023 
recorded that the accused did not get a fair trial 
as their counsel had admitted the documents of 
the prosecution and had dispensed with its 
formal proof. This resulted into a serious and 
fatal illegality and as such in order to extend to 
the accused a fair trial, it was expedient to remit 
the matter back to the Trial Court for further trial 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

from the stage of recording of evidence of PW 2 
(he had not been cross-examined by the defence), 
after affording liberty to cross-examine PW 2. The 
prosecution would produce its formal witnesses 
and the defence would have liberty to cross-
examine them also and only thereafter the trial 
may be concluded and decided. 
9. Aggrieved by the said order of remand, the 
informant has preferred the present appeals. 
10. The submission advanced on behalf of the 
appellant is to the effect that the High Court fell 
in error in remanding the matter and giving 
liberty to the accused to first cross-examine PW 
2 and thereafter allow the prosecution to lead 
further evidence in the form of formal witnesses 
to prove the police papers and only thereafter 
proceed further with the trial, maybe by 
recording a further statement under section 313 
CrPC. 
11. According to the learned counsel for the 
appellant, if the judgment of the High Court is 
allowed to stand, it would render the provisions 
of section 294 CrPC redundant and otiose. It was 
also submitted that it is not for any error or 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

oversight of defence counsel that they had 
admitted the genuineness of the police papers by 
dispensing formal proof of the same, rather they 
had 
repeatedly 
confirmed 
their 
stand 
of 
admitting the genuineness of the documents and 
had opposed the recall of witnesses by the Public 
Prosecutor on two occasions, once in 2005 and 
again in 2019. It was thus submitted that the 
High Court ought to have decided the appeal on 
merits on the basis of evidence led during the 
trial and there was no justification for remanding 
the matter. 
12. On the other hand, learned counsel for the 
respondent-State of U.P. has supported the case 
of the appellant and submitted that despite the 
Public Prosecutor having repeatedly requested 
the Trial Court to allow them to produce the 
formal witnesses but on account of strong 
opposition by the counsel for defence, the Trial 
Court had rejected the said request as such there 
was no justification for remitting the matter back 
to the Trial Court for a further trial from the stage 
of recording of evidence of PW 2. 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

13. Learned counsel for the respondents accused in 
the three appeals supported the judgment of the 
High Court. There is no denial by the learned 
counsel that the stand taken by the defence 
counsel before the Trial Court was any different 
from what has been submitted by the counsel for 
the 
appellant. 
 
He 
only 
submitted 
that 
considering the principles of fair trial, this Court 
may not interfere with the impugned judgment 
and order. 
14. Section 294 of the CrPC reads as follows: 
“Section 294 – No formal proof of certain 
documents 
1. Where any document is filed before any Court 
by the prosecution or the accused, the 
particulars of every such document shall be 
included in a list and the prosecution or the 
accused, as the case may be, or the pleader for 
the prosecution or the accused, if any, shall be 
called upon to admit or deny the genuineness 
of each such document. 
 
2. The list of documents shall be in such form as 
may be prescribed by the State Government. 

3. Where the genuineness of any document is not 
disputed, such document may be read in 
evidence 
in 
any 
inquiry 
trial 
or 
other 
proceeding under this Code without proof of the 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

signature of the person to whom it purports to 
be signed: 
 
Provided that the Court may, in its discretion, 
require such signature to be proved.” 
 
15. A bare reading of the aforesaid provision, 
in particular, sub-section (3) provides that 
where the genuineness of any document is not 
disputed, such document may be read in 
evidence 
in 
any 
inquiry, 
trial 
or 
other 
proceeding under this Code without proof of the 
signature of the person to whom it purports to 
be signed. That is to say that if the authors of 
such documents does not enter the witness box 
to prove their signatures, the said documents 
could still be read in evidence. Further, under 
the proviso the Court has the jurisdiction in its 
discretion to require such signature to be 
proved. In the present case, the documents filed 
by the investigating agency were all public 
documents duly signed by public servants in 
their 
respective 
capacities 
either 
as 
Investigating Officer or the doctor conducting 
the autopsy or other police officials preparing 
the memo of recoveries etc. As such the Trial 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

Court had rightly relied upon the same and 
exhibited them in view of the specific repeated 
stand taken by the defence in admitting the 
genuineness of the said documents. In so far as 
the police papers which had been signed by 
private persons like the informant, the same 
had been duly proved. 
16. Thus the only job left for the Court was to 
appreciate, 
analyse 
and 
test 
the 
credit-
worthiness 
of 
the 
evidence 
led 
by 
the 
prosecution which was available on record and 
if such evidence beyond reasonable doubt 
established the charges, the conviction could be 
recorded. However, if the evidence was not 
credit-worthy and worthy of reliance, the 
accused could be given benefit of doubt or clean 
acquittal. 
17. The Trial Court, after appreciating the 
evidence, found that the evidence of PW 1 and 
2, eye-witnesses to the account, to have fully 
supported the prosecution story and during the 
cross-examination, the defence could not elicit 
anything which could discredit their testimony. 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

18. Coming back to the applicability of section 
294 CrPC, reference may be had to the following 
judgments of this Court in the case of Sonu 
alias Amar vs. State of Haryana4 wherein this 
Court had held in para 30 as follows: 
“30. Section 294 of the Cr.P.C. 1973 provides 
a procedure for filing documents in a Court 
by the prosecution or the accused. The 
documents have to be included in a list and 
the other side shall be given an opportunity 
to admit or deny the genuineness of each 
document. In case the genuineness is not 
disputed, such document shall be read in 
evidence without formal proof in accordance 
with the Evidence Act.” 
 
19. Further, in the case of Shamsher Singh 
Verma vs. State of Haryana5, this Court held 
in para 14 as under: 
“14….. It is not necessary for the court to 
obtain admission or denial on a document 
under sub-section (1) to Section 294 CrPC 
personally from the accused or complainant 
or the witness. The endorsement of 
admission or denial made by the counsel for 
defence, on the document filed by the 
prosecution or on the application/ report 
with which same is filed, is sufficient 
compliance of Section 294 CrPC. Similarly 
on a document filed by the defence, 
endorsement of admission or denial by the 
 
4 (2017) 
5 (2016) 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

public prosecutor is sufficient and defence 
will have to prove the document if not 
admitted by the prosecution. In case it is 
admitted, it need not be formally proved, and 
can be read in evidence. In a complaint case 
such an endorsement can be made by the 
counsel for the complainant in respect of 
document filed by the defence.” 
 
20. Also, this Court in the case of Akhtar vs. 
State of Uttaranchal6 has held in para 21 as 
under: 
“21. 
It 
has 
been 
argued 
that 
non-
examination 
of 
the 
concerned 
medical 
officers is fatal for the prosecution. However, 
there is no denial of the fact that the defence 
admitted the genuineness of the injury 
reports and the poot-mortem examination 
reports before the trial court. So the 
genuineness 
and 
authenticity 
of 
the 
documents stands proved and shall be 
treated as valid evidence under Section 294 
of the CrPC. It is settled position of law that 
if the genuineness of any document filed by 
a party is not disputed by the opposite party 
it can be read as substantive evidence under 
sub-section 

of 
Section 

CrPC. 
Accordingly, the post-mortem report, if its 
genuineness is not disputed by the opposite 
party, the said post-mortem report can be 
read as substantive evidence to prove the 
correctness of its contents without the doctor 
concerned being examined.” 

6 (2009) 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

21. On a plain reading of section 294 CrPC 
and its interpretation by this Court in the above 
judgments, we do not find any error in the 
judgment of the Trial Court and particularly 
considering the facts of the present case where 
the defence repeatedly continued to admit the 
genuineness of the prosecution documents 
exempting them from formal proof. 
22. In our opinion, the High Court fell in error. 
Moreover, reliance by the High Court on the 
case of Munna Pandey vs. State of Bihar7 was 
misplaced, because in that case the issue was 
of fair trial and not of the application of section 
294 CrPC. In the case of Munna Pandey 
(supra), 
prosecution 
witnesses 
were 
not 
confronted with their statements under section 
161 CrPC for purposes of contradiction and in 
such a situation this Court had held that if the 
same be put to witnesses under section 145 of 
the Evidence Act, 1872 it would have a bearing 
and, therefore, remitted the matter to the Trial 
 
7 (2023) SCC OnLine SC 1103 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

Court 
for 
further 
examination/cross-
examination of the prosecution witnesses. 
23. For all the reasons recorded above, we 
allow these appeals, set aside the impugned 
judgment and order of the High Court and 
restore the criminal appeals before the High 
Court to be heard and decided afresh on merits 
on the basis of material on record. 
24. Considering the fact that the incident is 
of 1998, we request the High Court to make an 
endeavour to decide the appeals afresh on the 
basis of the evidence led during the trial as early 
as possible. 
25. The private respondents in all the three 
appeals who stand convicted under the order of 
the Trial Court, would surrender within six 
weeks before the Trial Court and it would be 
open for them to apply for suspension of 
sentence before the High Court on admissible 
grounds in accordance to law, which application 
would be considered on its own merits 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 16282-16284 of 2023 

uninfluenced by any observations made in this 
order. We further make it clear that the evidence 
has not been appreciated by us.
