The present appeals arise out of a suit for partition1
filed by the appellant for partition of the property jointly owned
at that time by the appellant-plaintiff and respondents-
defendant Nos.1 to 9. Defendant Nos.10 to 14 were impleaded

in the suit as they were stated to be tenants on the part of the
property. During the pendency of the suit before the Trial
Court2 respondent-defendant No.3, Bhupinder Singh, having
sold his share to S.C. Bhalla, he was impleaded as defendant
No.3(a). Further, defendant Nos.6 to 9 having sold their shares
to the subsequent buyers, who were impleaded as defendant
Nos.15 to 19.
3.
After the amendments were carried out in the plaint,
considering the subsequent events and impleadment of
subsequent buyers, the final prayer was for partition of the suit
property by metes and bounds and in case not possible, sale
thereof by open auction and distribution of the sale proceeds
amongst the co-sharers. Prayer was also made for directing the
defendant Nos.3 to 9 to furnish accounts of rent collected by
them from tenants and a direction to the tenants (defendant
Nos.10 to 14) to deposit the rent in the court. Further, the
plaintiff sought direction against defendant No.3-Bhupinder
Singh to pay mesne profit at the rate of ₹150/- per square ft. per month for the area under his occupation. The present
litigation is at the stage of passing of preliminary decree. The
percentage of shares of the plaintiff and the defendants

originally impleaded in the suit, to which no dispute has been
raised by the parties before this Court, have been noticed by
the High Court3 in the impugned judgment dated 05.04.20184.

The aforesaid position was before the sale of their
respective shares by defendant No.3-Bhupinder Singh to
defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla and by defendant Nos.6 to 9 to
defendant Nos.15 to 19. Preliminary decree for partition of the
suit property to the extent of 25% share was passed by the Trial
Court on 10.10.2012 in favour of the plaintiff. As the property
could not be partitioned on account of legal bar under the
3 High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh
4 Passed in RSA No. 6076 of 2015

Chandigarh (Sale of Sites and Buildings) Rules, 19605, the same
was directed to be auctioned. The preliminary decree was also
passed for rendition of accounts against the defendants
wherein all the co-sharers of the suit property were directed to
render accounts. Defendant Nos.4 & 5 having inducted tenants
in some portion of the suit property in their possession were
directed to submit the accounts of rent collected by them. The
market rate of the rent of the portions in possession of
defendant no.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla and defendant Nos.15 to 19 were
to be determined while passing the final decree. Defendant
No.3(a) having stepped into the shoes of defendant No.3,
defendant Nos.4 & 5, and defendant Nos.15 to 19, having
stepped into the shoes of defendant Nos.6 to 9, were restrained
from creating charge or encumbrances on the suit property.
5.
Challenging the aforesaid preliminary decree passed
by the Trial Court, two appeals were filed. was filed by defendant No.3(a), and was filed by defendant Nos.15 to 19, the
subsequent buyers from defendant Nos.6 to 9.
5 Hereinafter referred to as ‘the 1960 Rules’

5.1
Inter alia the ground raised by defendant No.3(a)-S.C.
Bhalla regarding the mesne profit was that the assessment of
the rent by the Trial Court was not appropriate as material
evidence placed on record was not considered. Rent being
given by a tenant for a small area cannot be made the basis of
assessment of rent of the complete building. There was no
denial as such regarding his liability to pay the rent. He had
even admitted the fact that certain tenants had been inducted
by him. 
5.2
The defendant Nos.15 to 19/appellants before the
First Appellate Court are in possession of part of the suit
property on the ground floor, in which they are carrying on
business. The appeal was filed primarily on two grounds,
firstly, that the property was sold to them while concealing the
fact of pendency of the civil suit regarding partition of the
property and passing of restraint order. Another objection
raised by them was for rendition of accounts claiming that they
were in possession of less than 15 % share of the suit property
and had not been collecting any rent, hence, no accounts are to
be rendered.

5.3
The First Appellate Court6 allowed the appeal filed by
the defendant Nos.15 to 19 holding that they, being in
possession of the share of the suit property to the extent of
their ownership, were not liable to render accounts to other co-
sharers.
5.4
As far as the appeal filed by the defendant No.3(a) is
concerned, the judgment and decree of the Trial Court was
upheld and the appeal filed by him was dismissed.
6.
Aggrieved against the judgment and decree of the
First Appellate Court, two appeals were preferred before the
High Court. 
6.1
 R.S.A. No.6076 of 2015 was filed by the plaintiff
impugning the judgment and decree passed in the appeal
preferred by the defendant Nos.15 to 19, which was allowed by
the First Appellate Court.
6.2
R.S.A. No.2761 of 2016 was filed by the defendant
No.3(a) impugning the judgment and decree of the First
Appellate Court whereby the judgment and decree of the Trial
Court qua him was upheld.
6 Additional District Judge, Chandigarh

6.3
Both the appeals were taken up together and decided
vide judgment7 dated 05.04.2018. Second appeal8 was
disposed of by a short order in terms of judgment passed in
R.S.A. No.6076 of 2015. The appeal preferred by the plaintiff
challenging the judgment and decree in favour of the
defendant Nos.15 to 19 was dismissed, whereas appeal filed by
defendant No.3(a) was allowed. The High Court held that
defendant No.3(a) cannot be asked to render accounts. He got
the possession of the property after purchase from the earlier
co-sharer Bhupinder Singh (defendant No.3), who got the same
vacated after protracted litigation. Even if he was owner of the
1% share, he was not in wrongful possession. 
6.4
As far as the appeal pertaining to defendant Nos.15
to 19 is concerned, it was opined that they being the co-sharers
in possession having no income are not liable to render any
accounts.
7.
In the aforesaid factual matrix, the matter is before
this Court at the stage of preliminary decree in a partition suit.
The plaintiff has challenged the judgment of the High Court.
7 Passed in R.S.A. No. 6076 of 2015.
8 Passed in R.S.A. No. 2761 of 2016 dated 05.04.2018

8.
Learned counsel for the appellant-plaintiff submitted
that with the impugned judgment passed by the High Court an
anomalous situation has been created. In the suit property at
present there are 11 co-sharers, which was originally owned by
10 co-sharers. Judgment and decree of the Trial Court
regarding sale of the property by way of auction was not
challenged by any of the co-sharers to the extent of 84%.
Challenge was made on the issue of rendition of accounts by
the co-sharers. Dispute was sought to be raised only by co-
sharers to the extent of 16% by filing two separate appeals.
One by a co-sharer who owns only 1% share and another by a
set of five co-sharers who own 15% shares. 
8.1
The party which owned 1% share in the suit property
has in his possession half portion of the ground floor in a three-
story building. Whereas another set of persons who were
owners to the extent of 15% of shares are in possession of
another half on the ground floor. The first and second floors of
the building were under the control of the defendant Nos.4 & 5
which were let out to the tenants. They have no objection to
render accounts of the rent collected. 

9.
As far as defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla, who is owner
to the extent of 1% share and in possession of half portion of
the ground floor, is concerned even if he had not let out the
property, still he is liable to make good the loss suffered by the
other co-sharers. The reasoning given by the High Court to
absolve him from rendering accounts cannot be legally
sustained as he had purchased the property from the erstwhile
owner defendant No.3-Bhupinder Singh and got the vacant
physical possession. There is nothing on record to suggest that
after purchasing the property, he litigated and got the
possession from the tenants.
9.1
Insofar as another set of co-sharers to the extent of
15% shares is concerned, they are using half portion of the
ground floor for their business, hence liable to pay for use and
occupation of the property. They cannot, of their own, claim
that the portion in their possession is to the extent of their
ownership in the suit property. This is to be determined by the
Court. In case they are found to be in possession of the
property to the extent of their share and they do not contribute
to the common kitty for use and occupation of the premises,
they will not be entitled to any share out of the amount

collected from the balance 85%. This exercise can very well be
done at the time of passing of final decree.
10.
Learned counsel for the respondents-defendant
nos.15 to 19, set of co-sharers having 15% share in the
property, submitted that they are in possession of only 9.48%
of the property, on the ground floor. It was purchased during
the pendency of litigation. There was no relief claimed for
rendition of accounts qua them in the suit. There was no
prayer made in the suit for a direction to the defendant Nos.15
to 19 to render accounts. They may be liable to render
accounts if they are in possession of area more than their
share. In fact, they are in possession of area less than their
share. In the alternative, regarding the rate of rent to be
calculated in such circumstances, it was submitted that in case
the said defendants are required to render accounts, the rent
should not be calculated at the market rate. In fact, the
defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla is in possession of the area of the
property more than his share.
11.
Insofar as the co-sharer, defendant No.3(a)-S.C.
Bhalla, to the extent of 1% share is concerned, the argument is
that issue no.3 framed by the Trial Court was regarding

direction to furnish the accounts of rent collected from the
tenants. In the case in hand, the portion in possession of the
present co-sharer was never let out. Rendition of accounts and
mesne profits are two different concepts. It was further argued
that when the matter was pending before the High Court,
defendant No.3(a) offered to give possession of the suit
property with him to other co-sharers. An application9 in the
paper book at page no.343 was referred to. The same is dated
27.09.2017. The argument raised is that he having offered
possession cannot now be made liable to render accounts or
mesne profits. He had purchased the property from defendant
No.3-Bhupinder Singh. Whatever possession was available with
him was given to defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla. Issue of
mesne profits will come in only if the defendant No.3(a) is found
to be in wrongful possession and the same was not given to
other owners when asked for.
12.
As far as the respondents-defendant Nos.4 & 5 are
concerned, the arguments raised by the learned counsel are
that when partition of an immovable property is to take place,
Order XX Rule 18(2) of C.P.C. will be applicable. Sub-rule (2)
clearly provides that at the time of passing of preliminary
9 CM-12168-C-2017 in RSA-2761-2016 (O&M)

decree declaring the rights of several parties interested in the
property, the Court may give such further directions as may be
required. The Trial Court had rightly directed all the parties to
render accounts either for the rent collected by them or for the
portion in their possession for which the rent was assessed at
the rate of ₹107/- per square ft. per month. It was pertaining to
the defendant No.3(a) and the defendants Nos.15 to 19. For
the portion under the control of the defendant Nos.4 & 5, which
was let out, they have already furnished the accounts. It is only
the defendant No.3(a) and defendant Nos.15 to 19 who are
reluctant to do the same. A simple suit for partition is pending
for about two decades despite the direction issued by this
Court, when the matter came at the stage of interim direction,
on 10.01.201210 to decide the suit within nine months.
13.
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused
the relevant referred record. As far as the percentage of shares
of different co-sharers in the property in-question is concerned,
though partly sold during the pendency of the suit, there is no
dispute. As on today it stands as under:

No dispute has been raised regarding partition of the
property by the Trial Court by any of the co-sharers. It is not a
matter of dispute that in terms of law laid down by this Court in
Resident’s Welfare Association and Another vs Union
Territory of Chandigarh and Others11 interpreting the 1960
Rules, there cannot be partition of property by metes and
bounds at Chandigarh. Hence, the only solution was for sale of
property by way of auction. This was the decree passed by the
Trial Court, which was not challenged by any of the co-sharers
on this issue. 
15.
It has now come on record that defendant No.3(a),
who purchased 1% share from the defendant No.3, is in
possession of half portion of the ground floor which according
to him has not been let out. Another half portion of the ground
11 (2023): 2023 INSC 22: (2023) 

floor is stated to be in possession of the respondents-defendant
Nos.15 to 19, who purchased 15% shares from the defendant
Nos.6 to 9 during the pendency of the civil suit and are utilizing
the same for their own business. Defendant Nos.4 & 5 are
stated to be in control of the first and second floor of the
property which are under the tenancy of different tenants. They
do not have any grievance against the direction issued by the
Trial Court regarding rendition of accounts of the rent collected
by them. In fact, they have already rendered the accounts. 
16. 
The effect of the judgment of the High Court is that
the co-sharers in the property to the extent of 16% are not
liable to render accounts.
17. 
Firstly, we deal with the issue regarding rendering of
accounts by the defendant No.3(a), who had stepped into the
shoes of defendant No.3 as he had purchased his share during
the pendency of this suit. It is not in dispute that the defendant
No.3 was owing only 1% of the share in the property in
question, whereas he had possession of a substantial part
thereof and handed over the possession of the same to the
defendant No.3(a).

18.
Defendant No.3(a), when appeared as a witness
before the Trial Court for his examination-in-chief, filed affidavit
dated 01.06.2012. He admitted that he had stepped into the
shoes of defendant No.3, having purchased his share by way of
a registered sale deed dated 02.06.2006. In paragraph 8 of the
affidavit, he stated that he had inducted five tenants in the
property, namely Sushma Kanwar, Santosh Chauhan, Deepak
Sagar, Inder Pal and Gurusharan Singh. The monthly rent
received therefrom was ₹1,500/-, ₹1,000/-, ₹1,500/-, ₹1,000/-
and ₹800/-, respectively was also mentioned. This information
was furnished by the defendant No.3(a) in compliance with an
order passed by the Trial Court on 04.04.2006, the relevant
parts thereof as contained in paras 23 and 26 of the said order
are extracted below:
“23.
………In the eventuality of the partition, the
plaintiff and the other co-owners shall be entitled to a
share in the rent and profits so, it will be in the fitness
of the things if the defendant No.3 is directed to keep
the proper accounts of the amount so realized by him
regarding the property in question. He is hereby
directed accordingly. xxx
xxx
xxx

26.
As a result of the above detailed
discussions, both the applications are disposed of
accordingly. The application for receiver stands
dismissed and the application under Order 39 rule 1
& 2 r/w 151 CPC stands disposed of with the
directions to defendant No.3 and the remaining
defendants to keep the proper accounts of the
amount so realized by them regarding the property in
dispute, like rent etc., and in case, the defendant
No.3 lets out the demised premises to anyone after
obtaining the possession, he will intimate the court in
advance with complete particulars of the person and
will also intimate such person that he will be bound
by the final outcome of the partition proceedings, and
defendant No.3 and the other co-owners will not
create any kind of charge on the property in dispute,
so as that the rights of the parties after partition can
be protected.”
18.1
To put the record straight with reference to the
amount of rent claimed to have been received by the defendant
No.3(a), it is relevant to refer to the fact that the learned
Additional District Judge vide order dated 24.05.2010 had
appointed the receiver. The receiver visited the spot (property
in question) and informed that none of the tenants as pointed
by defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla was occupying the premises.
The Trial Court in its order passed on 27.02.2012 found that the

documents (rent notes as were available in the record of the
Trial Court)12 produced by defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla
showing tenancy of the portion of the building in his possession
has doubt of genuineness thereof. It was also noticed that the
plaintiff was ready to pay ₹1,50,000/- per month as rent for the
portion in possession of defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla. Hence, it
would not be possible that he would rent out the same @
₹5,800/- per month. Be that as it may, this matter will require
examination by the Trial Court in the course of passing the final
decree.
19.
As far as defendant Nos.15 to 19 are concerned,
admittedly they are purchasers of the property from defendant
Nos.6 to 9 during the pendency of the suit. It is claimed by
them that they are carrying on their own business in the portion
in their possession and have not let out the same to anyone.
Hence, not generating any income therefrom by way of letting
out the property. The First Appellate Court held that they are
owners to the extent of 15% share in the property and are
stated to be in possession of front half portion on the ground
12 (i) Dated 10.10.2008 executed between S.C. Bhalla [D-3(a)] and Deepak Rai
 (ii) Dated 15.10.2008 executed between S.C. Bhalla [D-3(a)] and Santosh Chauhan
 (iii) Dated 18.10.2008 executed between S.C. Bhalla [D-3(a)] and I.P. Sharma
 (iv) Dated 24.10.2008 executed between S.C. Bhalla [D-3(a)] and Gursharan Singh
 (v) Dated 24.10.2008 executed between S.C. Bhalla [D-3(a)] and Sushma Kanwar

floor of the show-room (property in question), stated to be
about 1,050 sq. ft. The First Appellate Court had accepted their
contention, relieving them from liability to render accounts on
the ground that they are in possession of the suit property to
the extent of their ownership, a fact yet to be determined. The
value of the portion of different floors of the suit property may
be different, hence, the value of shares.
20.
As noticed earlier, the issue raised by the plaintiff
seeking partition of the joint property before this Court is only
with reference to rendition of accounts by the defendant
No.3(a) and defendant Nos. 15 to 19. The opinion expressed by
the High Court in the impugned judgment, that both of them
are not liable to render any accounts, deserves to be set aside. 
20.1
As far as defendant No.3(a) is concerned, as noticed
above, he, being in possession of part of the property on the
ground floor, had claimed that he had let out that to five
tenants @ ₹5,800/- per month. When the receiver was
appointed, defendant No.3(a) wanted to deposit with him the
rent collected from tenants. The receiver refused to accept the
rent. An application filed by the defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla
before the Trial Court for a direction to the receiver to receive a

cheque dated 25.08.2011 for ₹87,000/- was disposed of with
the observation that the receiver had rightly refused to receive
the alleged rent as the alleged tenancies created by S.C. Bhalla
were found to be prima facie not genuine. He shall be bound to
render the accounts at the time of partition as observed by the
High Court in its order dated 08.08.2011. The reference can be
made to the order dated 27.02.2012 passed by the Trial Court
while disposing of the applications filed by the receiver and the
defendant No.3(a).
21.
Since it is the admitted case of the defendant No.3(a)
himself that he had rented out a portion of the property and
collected rent therefrom, there was no good reason for the High
Court to have absolved him from rendition of accounts.
However, this is with a rider as the plea sought to be raised by
the defendant No.3(a) regarding rent notes produced by him
were prima facie found to be sham transactions, as the market
rate of the rent of the portion in control of the defendant
No.3(a) was much more at that time. Even plaintiff offered
₹1,50,000/- per month. Hence, Trial Court will have to hold an
inquiry on this aspect and fix appropriate rent to which the

defendant No.3(a) would be liable to contribute to the common
kitty for appropriation amongst all the co-sharers.
21.1
As far as the argument raised by the learned counsel
for the defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla regarding application filed
in the High Court offering to hand over possession of the
property in his possession is concerned, as annexed in the
present paper book at page No.343, the application was traced
out from the record and the same bears No.CM-12168-C-2017
in RSA-2761-2016. It is evident from the order passed by the
High Court dated 30.01.2018 that the aforesaid application was
directed to be heard with the main case. Meaning thereby that
the defendant No.3(a) may not be serious about the prayer
made in the application. It is further evident from the fact that
at the time of the final argument of the appeal again the prayer
made in the application was not pressed as there is no
discussion on the same and the issue was not raised by
defendant No.3(a) thereafter. 
21.2
The High Court misdirected itself in recording the
finding that the defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla, being in self-
occupation of the part of the property, being a co-sharer, will
not be liable to render any accounts to arrive at such a

conclusion. Reference was made to the fact that his vendor
(defendant No.3-Bhupinder Singh) has contested litigation with
the tenant (defendant No.10-M/s. H.M. Traders) and spent huge
amount thereon. But the fact remains that the defendant
No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla has purchased the property from defendant
no.3-Bhupinder Singh after it had already been vacated by the
tenant and he was handed over vacant physical possession
thereof. 
22.
As far as defendant Nos.15 to 19 are concerned,
there is no dispute that the portion in their possession has not
been rented out to any third party. But it is also a fact admitted
by them that they are carrying their own business in the portion
in their possession. They have been absolved from rendering
account on the ground that the portion in their possession is to
the extent of their share in the property. However, this issue
has not been determined by any authority. The fact remains
that the defendant Nos.15 to 19 are carrying on their own
business in the property in question in their possession and
earning therefrom. Had their business been carried on in a
rented premises, they would have certainly paid some rent. In
case, during the course of proceedings for passing of final

decree, the Court determines that the defendant Nos.15 to 19
were in actual physical possession of the property in question
to the extent of their share, they may not be liable to contribute
any amount in the kitty and subsequently will not be entitled to
any share from the total amount in the kitty coming out of the
amount collected from other portion of the property i.e. 85%.
However, in case it was found that they are in possession of
portion more than their share, there can be two options; either
they contribute to the common kitty for the entire portion of
the property in their possession and then get share therefrom
or they may be held liable to contribute to the common kitty for
the property in their possession beyond their share and
subsequently they will not be entitled to any share from the
common kitty. However, such an option will have to be
exercised by the defendant Nos.15 to 19 before assessment of
the rent, to be paid by the aforesaid defendants and not after
the rent has been assessed by the Trial Court.
23.
The appeals are accordingly allowed. The impugned
judgments passed by the High Court are set aside. There shall
be no order as to costs. It is directed that the defendant
No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla and defendant Nos.15 to 19, namely,

Kailash Chand Gupta, Indu Bala, Sahil Gupta, Pratik Gupta and
Ankita Gupta, respectively shall be liable to render accounts
and/or liable to contribute rent as assessed by the Trial Court
during the course of passing of final decree for the portions in
their respective possession. This Court has already elaborated
the course which needs to be adopted in para ‘22’ hereinabove
insofar as defendant Nos.15 to 19 are concerned.
24.
It is further clarified that after the sale of the property
if any of the co-sharers fail to contribute any amount to the
common kitty for distribution amongst all the co-sharers as
determined by the Trial Court, the distribution of the amount so
collected after the sale of the property shall be reduced to that
extent from the share of that co-sharer.
25.
We may notice here that the suit for partition was
filed way back in the year 2005. The matter is pending at the
stage of passing of preliminary decree for the last about two
decades that too in a case where the share of the parties is not
in dispute. The only dispute was with reference to rendition of
accounts by two of the co-sharers. Issues regarding whom
have been dealt with in this Judgment we direct the Trial Court

to expedite the proceedings and dispose of the same within a
period of nine months from the date of receipt of this order.
