IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA 
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. OF 2024 
( SLP(Crl.) No. 11654/2023) 
 
GURDEV SINGH BHALLA 
 
VERSUS 
STATE OF PUNJAB & ORS. 

JUDGMENT 
 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 

Leave granted. 
 
2. 
The challenge by means of this appeal is to an 
order dated 23rd March, 2023 passed by the High 
Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh whereby 
the Criminal Revision filed by the appellant against 
the order of the Special Judge, Bathinda dated 
05.03.2018 allowing the application under Section 

SLP(Crl.) No. 11654 of 2023 

319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 19731 
summoning the appellant along with three other 
officials of the Police Department has been dismissed. 
3. 
Relevant facts are as follows: 
3.1. 
Punjab Agro Foodgrains Corporation Ltd., 
Bathinda, lodged a complaint on 18.12.2012 at 
Police Station, Phul, District Bathinda against 
one Devraj Miglani2 which was registered as FIR 
No.91/2012 under Sections 406, 409, 420, 457, 
380 of the Indian Penal Code, 18603 and Section 
13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention 
of Corruption Act, 19884 with the allegations that 
Devraj 
had 
misappropriated 
paddy 
worth 
Rs.4.18 crores. The investigation of the said FIR 
was transferred to the Vigilance Bureau, 
Bathinda on 2nd May, 2013 where the appellant 
was posted as an Inspector and he was assigned 
the task of investigating the said crime. The 
accused Devraj was arrested on 31.08.2013. He 
was granted police remand on 04.09.2013 for 2-
 
1 Cr.P.C. 
2 Devraj 
3 IPC 
4 PC Act 

SLP(Crl.) No. 11654 of 2023 

3 days until 06.09.2013 and thereafter he was 
confined to judicial custody. 
3.2. 
Puneet Kumar Miglani5, the informant of 
the present case, happens to be the son of the 
accused Devraj. According to the informant of the 
present case on 06.09.2013 Head Constable 
Kikkar Singh approached Ms. Ritu, niece of the 
accused Devraj at her work place i.e. Bathinda 
branch of the SBI demanding a sum of 
Rs.50,000/- by handing over a slip which was 
said to have been written by the accused Devraj 
apparently mentioning that the holder of the slip 
may be provided the said amount. It is alleged 
that some conversation also took place between 
Devraj and his niece Ritu through the mobile 
phone of Head Constable Kikkar Singh. The 
informant Puneet Miglani came to know of the 
said demand by Kikkar Singh. He went to the 
Bank, took the slip in his possession and after 
recording some conversation between his wife 
and his father presented the same along with a 
complaint before the learned Magistrate.

SLP(Crl.) No. 11654 of 2023 

3.3. Direction was issued to the local police to 
register and inquire into the said complaint. After 
due enquiry which was carried out by the Deputy 
Superintendent of Police Janak Singh, it was 
found that the allegation against the Head 
Constable Kikkar Singh were prima facie made 
out and accordingly a First Information Report6 
No.11 of 2013 was registered on 11.09.2013 at 
police station Vigilance Bureau, Bathinda under 
Sections 166, 383, 385 IPC and also under the 
provisions of the PC Act. During the investigation 
of the said FIR No.11/2013, the statements of 
informant, wife of informant, Devraj and others 
were 
recorded. 
After 
completing 
the 
investigation, a police report under Section 
173(2) Cr.P.C. was submitted on 16th January, 
2014 against Head Constable Kikkar Singh only 
under Sections 166, 383, 385 IPC and Sections 
7, 13(2) of the PC Act. 
3.4. In the trial, the informant Puneet Miglani 
was first examined as PW1 on 26.05.2014. 
 
6 FIR 

SLP(Crl.) No. 11654 of 2023 

3.5. 29.09.2014 coincidentally happened to be 
the date in both the trials i.e. trial 
FIR No.91/2012 against Devraj and also the trial 
 FIR No.11/2013 against Head 
Constable 
Kikkar 
Singh. 
The 
appellant 
proceeded to depose, supporting the prosecution 
case as also the investigation carried out by him 
against Devraj. On the said date in the trial 
against Head Constable Kikkar Singh, informant 
in that case Puneet Miglani gave further evidence 
as PW 1. On the said date he completed his 
examination-in-chief 
as 
also 
the 
cross-
examination. Additionally, he kept an application 
under Section 319 Cr.P.C. ready for summoning 
the appellant and the three other police officials, 
and filed the same before the Court. 
4. 
The Trial Court, vide order dated 08.09.2016 
rejected the said application on the ground of lack of 
sanction under the PC Act as also Cr.P.C. The said 
order was challenged before the High Court 
successfully and the High Court, by order dated 
23.01.2018, remanded the matter back to the Trial 
Court for passing a fresh order ignoring the issue of 

SLP(Crl.) No. 11654 of 2023 

sanction. The High Court was of the view that no 
sanction was required. Pursuant to the remand, the 
Trial Court, by order dated 05.03.2018 allowed the 
application 
under 
Section 

Cr.P.C. and 
summoned the four police officials, viz. (i) Janak 
Singh, Dy.S.P., (ii) Gurdev Sigh Bhalla,, Inspector 
(appellant), (iii) H.C. Harjinder Singh and (iv) H.C. 
Rajwant Singh. The said order of 05.03.2018 was 
challenged by the appellant before the High Court 
primarily on the following grounds by way of criminal 
revision: 

The order of the Trial Court was not in 
accordance to the principles laid down by this 
Court in the case of Hardeep Singh vs. State of 
Punjab7 for summoning under Section 319 
Cr.P.C.; 

It was a pressure tactic on the part of the 
informant Puneet Miglani to brow-beat the 
appellant as he had deposed against his father 
Devraj; 
 
7 2014(1) RCR 623 

SLP(Crl.) No. 11654 of 2023 

The informant Puneet Miglani was a 
convict in another case and, therefore, no 
reliance ought to have been placed on his 
statement; and lastly, 

The order passed by the Trial Court was 
bad on merits as there was no evidence at all for 
passing the summoning order. 
5. 
The High Court, as narrated earlier, by the 
impugned order dated 23rd March, 2023 dismissed 
the said revision. 
6. 
It appears that before the High Court the main 
thrust of argument was regarding lack of sanction. 
Shri Gaurav Agarwal, learned counsel appearing for 
the appellant made the following submissions: 

The complaint dated 06.09.2013 did not 
contain any allegations against the appellant; 

The 
complaint 
made on 
06.09.2013 
related 
to 
demand 
of 
Rs.50,000/- 
only. 
Subsequently, in the statement given on 
29.09.2014, the allegation is that there was a 
demand of Rs.24 lakhs by the four officials which 
included one Deputy Superintendent of Police, 

SLP(Crl.) No. 11654 of 2023 

Janak Singh, the appellant and two other Head 
Constables viz. Harjinder Singh and Rajwant 
Singh; 

A new case was sought to be set up only in 
order to brow-beat the appellant as he had 
deposed against his father Devraj in the other 
case.; 

The Trial Court and the High Court have 
mainly confined the discussion with respect to 
sanction under Section 19 of the PC Act and 
Section 197 of the Cr.P.C. but have not examined 
the merits of the matter as to whether the 
principles and parameters laid down in the case 
of Hardeep Singh (supra) had been followed or 
whether the said ingredients were present before 
the Trial Court so as to justify the summoning 
order under Section 319 Cr.P.C. 
7. 
On the other hand, Shri Sunil Fernandes, 
learned Addl. Advocate General, appearing for the 
State of Punjab and Ms. Eshaa Miglani-wife of the 
complainant, appearing in person on behalf of the 
complainant, were heard. According to them, the 
courts below had correctly appreciated the evidence 

SLP(Crl.) No. 11654 of 2023 

on record. They also submitted that the appellant and 
other police officials had harassed and tortured not 
only Devraj while he was in custody but had also 
threatened and tortured the family members both 
mentally and physically in order to extract huge 
amount of money. Our attention was also drawn to 
the statements recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. during investigation as also before the Trial Court of 
the relevant witnesses. It was lastly prayed that the 
appeal be dismissed and the appellant and other 
police officials must face the trial for the crime 
committed by them. 
8. 
Having considered the submissions and having 
perused the material on record, it is quite apparent 
that the informant Puneet Miglani, in his statement 
under section 161 Cr.P.C. recorded on 22.09.2013, 
had narrated complete facts with respect to the 
conduct of the police officials immediately after the 
surrender of his father on 30.08.2013 in the case 
registered against him for mis-appropriation. The 
consistent case right from that stage till the 
statement was recorded during the trial on a number 
of occasions, the informant has supported the 

SLP(Crl.) No. 11654 of 2023 

statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. Even Devraj and 
Eshaa Miglani in their statements recorded during 
investigation 
on 
15.10.2013 
and 
22.10.2013 
respectively, have given the same details as narrated 
by the informant Puneet Miglani on 22.09.2013. 
Further their statements during trial also supports 
and is in line with their previous statement. All these 
witnesses have equivocally narrated the incidents 
that took place at different places regarding threats, 
demand of huge sum of money, torture of Devraj etc. 
 
9. The complaint dated 06.09.2013, on the basis of 
which the FIR No.11/2013 was registered, related to 
the incident which happened at the Bank where Ritu, 
niece of Devraj, was working Head Constable Kikkar 
Singh had gone there to collect Rs.50,000/- against 
a slip issued by Devraj. Since everything happened 
on the same day it is quite possible that the entire 
story from the time of surrender of Devraj could not 
have been mentioned but soon after that at the first 
instance the conduct of the appellant and the other 
police officials trying to extract money from Devraj 
and his family members was mentioned in detail by 

SLP(Crl.) No. 11654 of 2023 

all the witnesses. According to them, the amount was 
being demanded for the following benefits to be 
extended: (i) firstly, not to physically torture Devraj; 
(ii) not to ask for further police remand; (iii) to help 
him get bail; and (iv) to give him good treatment 
during his custody. The statement of Ms. Eshaa 
Miglani as also Devraj recorded in the trial as PW-18 
and PW-13 respectively have also supported the 
prosecution case regarding the demand of huge 
amount of money for extending all the benefits, as 
noted above. 
10. The argument mainly advanced by the counsel 
for the appellant that the FIR mentioned only about 
Rs.50,000/- whereas subsequent story of Rs.24 
lakhs had been set up only in order to brow-beat the 
appellant being annoyed with the appellant because 
he gave evidence against his father, may be difficult 
to accept. 
11. Further argument of Mr. Agarwal that the 
informant moved the application under Section 319 
Cr.P.C. on 29.09.2014 was a counterblast and with 
annoyance and vengeance as appellant had deposed 
against his father on the same day, has no legs to 

SLP(Crl.) No. 11654 of 2023 

stand. It is factually incorrect. Informant PW 1 had 
given the same statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. and also before the Trial Court on 26.05.2014 which 
was continued on 29.09.2014. 
12. The argument advanced on behalf of the 
appellant with regard to brow-beating the appellant 
as he was the Investigating Officer against Devraj can 
be taken as a defence in the trial. 
13. We have perused the statements under Section 
161 Cr.P.C. as also the depositions of PW-1, PW-13 
and PW-18. The parameters laid down in the 
Constitution Bench judgment in Hardeep Singh 
(supra) stand fully satisfied. We are refraining 
ourselves from commenting on the police report 
under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. being submitted only 
charging Kikkar Singh to be sent for trial. 
14. In view of the discussion made above, there 
appears to be prima facie evidence on record to make 
it a triable case as against the appellant. We, 
accordingly, are not inclined to interfere with the 
impugned order. Consequently, the appeal is 
dismissed. 

SLP(Crl.) No. 11654 of 2023 

15. We may also place on record the fact that we are 
not threadbare discussing the testimony of the 
witness during the trial as it may ultimately influence 
the Trial Court at a later stage. We, further, make it 
clear that any observations made in this order will 
not come in the way of the Trial Court in deciding the 
trial on its own merits on the basis of the evidence 
adduced before it, completely uninfluenced by this 
judgment.
