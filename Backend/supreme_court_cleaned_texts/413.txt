Respondent No. 1-plaintiff, along with defendant Nos. 2, 3, 4 
and deceased M. Balraj Reddy1 had constituted a partnership firm-
defendant No. 1 namely “M/s Shivraj Reddy & Brothers” 
(hereinafter being referred to as ‘firm’) on 15th August, 1978 with 
its primary business being the construction of buildings on a 
contract basis with respect to the works of the Government and 
Municipalities. 
5. 
Respondent No. 1-plaintiff instituted O.S. No. 67 of 19972 
seeking relief of dissolution of the firm and rendition of accounts. 
The learned II Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad 
(hereinafter being referred to as ‘trial Court’), allowed the original 
 
1 Died in 1984 
2 Initially filed as O.S. No. 3 of 1996 but later renumbered as (O.S. No. 67 of 1997) 

suit filed by respondent No. 1-plaintiff and passed a decree dated 
26th October, 1998 declaring the firm-defendant No. 1 to be 
dissolved and directed defendant Nos. 2 to 4 to tender accounts of 
the firm from the year 1979 onwards till October, 1998 and 
further, granted liberty to respondent No. 1-plaintiff to file a 
separate application seeking appointment of an Advocate 
Commissioner for taking accounts of the firm and for other 
appropriate reliefs. 
6. 
Being aggrieved, the firm-defendant No. 1 and defendant No. 
2 preferred C.C.C. Appeal No. 35 of 1999 before the High Court of 
Judicature of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad. Learned Single 
Judge of the High Court vide judgment dated 19th October, 2001 
allowed C.C.C. Appeal No. 35 of 1999 on the ground that O.S. No. 
67 of 1997 was barred by limitation as one of the partners in 
subsisting partnership firm, Shri M. Balraj Reddy expired in 1984, 
therefore the firm stood dissolved immediately on the death of the 
partner. Since the original suit was filed in 1996, it was barred by 
limitation. 
7. 
Aggrieved by the decision of learned Single Judge, respondent 
No. 1-plaintiff preferred LPA No. 47 of 2002 before the learned 
Division Bench of the High Court, which allowed the appeal and 

set aside the judgment dated 19th October, 2001 passed by the 
learned Single Judge in C.C.C. Appeal No. 35 of 1999, observing 
that the plea of limitation was never raised during the pleadings in 
the trial Court and learned Single Judge ought not to have dealt 
with that issue at all. Being aggrieved, appellants have preferred 
the present appeal by special leave. 
Submissions of behalf of the appellants:- 
8. 
Learned counsel representing the appellants urged that the 
suit was filed by respondent No. 1-plaintiff for dissolution of the 
defendant No. 1-firm and for the rendition of accounts in the year 
1996. He referred to the partnership deed dated 25th April, 1978, 
whereby the firm-defendant No.1 was constituted and urged that 
the partnership was a partnership at will. He drew the attention 
of the Court to Section 42 of the Partnership Act, 1932 (hereinafter 
being referred to as ‘the Act’) which reads as below: - 
“42. Dissolution on the happening of certain contingencies. 
— Subject to contract between the partners a firm is dissolved— 
(a) if constituted for a fixed term, by the expiry of the term; 
(b) if constituted to carry out one or more adventures or 
undertakings, by the completion thereof; 
(c) by the death of a partner; and 
(d) by the adjudication of a partner as an insolvent.” 

9. 
Learned counsel submitted that as per Section 42(c) of the 
Act, the death of a partner leads to automatic dissolution of the 
firm. He submitted that Shri M. Balraj Reddy i.e. Partner No. 3 in 
the firm admittedly expired in the year 1984 and consequent to his 
death, the firm stood dissolved automatically. 
10. He further urged that it is settled law that it is the duty of the 
Court to dismiss any suit instituted after the prescribed period of 
limitation, although limitation has not been set up as a defence 
and thus, the learned Division Bench erred in allowing LPA No. 47 
of 2002 and interfering with the judgment dated 19th October, 
2001 passed by the learned Single Judge on the basis that the plea 
of limitation was never raised during the pleadings and thus, the 
learned Single Judge ought not to have dealt with the issue of 
limitation. 
11. On these grounds, learned counsel for the appellants urged 
that the impugned judgment whereby, the decree passed by the 
learned trial Court to dissolve the firm- defendant No. 1 and 
directing the partners to tender the accounts was upheld is ex facie 
illegal, and therefore, deserves to be quashed and set aside. 

Submissions on behalf of Respondents: - 
12., learned counsel representing respondent No. 1-
plaintiff disputed the contentions of the learned counsel 
representing the appellants and urged that there is documentary 
evidence on record to show that the firm-defendant No.1 continued 
to exist and its business activities continued even after the death 
of Shri M. Balraj Reddy. He, therefore, urged that the contentions 
put forth by the learned counsel for the appellants that the firm 
stood dissolved automatically on the death of Shri M. Balaraj 
Reddy is misconceived. 
13. He further contended that the issue of limitation was never 
raised before the trial Court and thus, the same could not have 
been allowed to be taken at the first appellate stage. On these 
grounds, he sought dismissal of the appeal. 
14. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the 
submissions advanced at bar and have gone through the 
impugned judgment and the material placed on record. 
Discussion and Conclusion: - 
15. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we find that the 
reasoning given by the learned Division Bench while dismissing 
LPA No. 47 of 2002, that the learned Single Judge ought not to 

have considered the question of limitation as the defendants did 
not choose to raise the plea of limitation in the trial Court is ex-
facie erroneous. Law in this regard has been settled by this Court 
through a catena of decisions. We may refer to the judgment in the 
case of V.M. Salgaocar and Bros. v. Board of Trustees of Port 
of Mormugao and Another3, wherein this Court held as follows: 
“20. The mandate of Section 3 of the Limitation Act is that 
it is the duty of the court to dismiss any suit instituted 
after the prescribed period of limitation irrespective of the 
fact that limitation has not been set up as a defence. If a 
suit is ex facie barred by the law of limitation, a court has no 
choice but to dismiss the same even if the defendant 
intentionally has not raised the plea of limitation. 
21. This 
Court 
in Manindra 
Land 
& 
Building 
Corpn. 
Ltd. v. Bhutnath Banerjee [(1964): AIR 1964 SC 
1336] held (AIR para 9): 
“Section 3 of the Limitation Act enjoins a court to 
dismiss any suit instituted, appeal preferred and 
application made, after the period of limitation 
prescribed therefor by Schedule I irrespective of the 
fact whether the opponent had set up the plea of 
limitation or not. It is the duty of the court not to 
proceed with the application if it is made beyond 
the period of limitation prescribed. The Court had 
no choice and if in construing the necessary provision 
of the Limitation Act or in determining which 
provision 
of 
the 
Limitation 
Act 
applies, 
the 
subordinate court comes to an erroneous decision, it 
is open to the court in revision to interfere with that 
conclusion as that conclusion led the court to assume 
or not to assume the jurisdiction to proceed with the 
determination of that matter.” 
 (emphasis supplied) 
 
3 (2005) 

16. Thus, it is a settled law that even if the plea of limitation is 
not set up as a defence, the Court has to dismiss the suit if it is 
barred by limitation. 
17. The fact that the firm-defendant No.1 namely “M/s Shivraj 
Reddy & Brothers”, was a partnership at will, is not in dispute. It 
is also not disputed that one of the partners of the firm, namely, 
Shri M. Balraj Reddy expired in the year 1984. This event leaves 
no room for doubt that the partnership would stand dissolved 
automatically on the death of the partner as per Section 42(c) of 
the Act. In the case of Davesh Nagalya(Dead) and Ors. v. 
Pradeep Kumar(Dead) through Legal Representatives and 
Ors.4, this Court held that in terms of Section 42(c) of the Act, the 
partnership stands dissolved upon the death of the partner. 
18. The question of limitation in the admitted facts of the present 
case is pure question of law and not mixed question of fact and 
law, because the fact regarding the death of one of the partners i.e. 
Shri M. Balraj Reddy is not disputed. This Court in the case of 
Narne Rama Murthy v. Ravula Somasundaram and Ors.5, 
observed as follows: - 
“5. We also see no substance in the contention that the suit 
was barred by limitation and that the courts below should have 
 
4 (2021) 
5 (2005) 

decided the question of limitation. When limitation is the pure 
question of law and from the pleadings itself it becomes 
apparent that a suit is barred by limitation, then, of course, 
it is the duty of the court to decide limitation at the outset 
even in the absence of a plea. However, in cases where the 
question of limitation is a mixed question of fact and law and 
the suit does not appear to be barred by limitation on the face 
of it, then the facts necessary to prove limitation must be 
pleaded, an issue raised and then proved. In this case the 
question of limitation is intricately linked with the question 
whether the agreement to sell was entered into on behalf of all 
and whether possession was on behalf of all. It is also linked 
with the plea of adverse possession. Once on facts it has been 
found that the purchase was on behalf of all and that the 
possession was on behalf of all, then, in the absence of any 
open, hostile and overt act, there can be no adverse possession 
and the suit would also not be barred by limitation. The only 
hostile act which could be shown was the advertisement issued 
in 1989. The suit filed almost immediately thereafter.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
19. A fervent plea was raised by learned counsel for the 
respondents that the firm continued to exist even after the death 
of Shri M. Balraj Reddy, and the business activities were continued 
by the firm. Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that the 
partners were carrying on the business activities after the death of 
Shri M. Balraj Reddy, there cannot be any doubt that the firm 
stood dissolved automatically in the year 1984 as mandated under 
Section 42(c) of the Act unless and until there was a contract 
between the remaining partners of the firm to the contrary. There 
is of course, no such averment by the respondents. The business 
activities even if carried on by the remaining partners of the firm 

after the death of Shri M. Balraj Reddy, would be deemed to be 
carried in their individual capacity in the circumstances noted 
above. 
20. The period of limitation for filing a suit for rendition of 
account is three years from the date of dissolution. In the present 
case, the firm dissolved in year 1984 by virtue of death of Shri M. 
Balraj Reddy and thus, the suit could only have been instituted 
within a period of three years from that event. Indisputably, the 
suit came to be filed in the year 1996 and was clearly time-barred, 
therefore, learned Single Judge was justified in accepting the 
C.C.C. Appeal No. 35 of 1999 and rejecting the suit as being 
hopelessly barred by limitation. 
21. As a consequence, the impugned judgment dated 27th March, 
2014 passed by the Division Bench in LPA No. 47 of 2002 does not 
stand to scrutiny and is hereby reversed and set aside. 
22. The appeal is allowed accordingly. No order as to costs. 
23. Decree be prepared accordingly. 
24. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. 
 
Civil Appeals (Civil) No(s). 23143-23144 of 2016 
 
25. Leave granted. 

26. The present appeals by special leave are preferred against the 
judgment dated 27th March, 2014 passed by the Division Bench of 
High Court of Judicature of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad, 
whereby the learned Division Bench vide a common judgment 
dismissed LPA No. 37 of 2002 preferred by defendant No. 1 and 
the firm-defendant No. 9 and allowed LPA No. 48 of 20026 preferred 
by respondent No. 1-plaintiff.

28. Respondent No. 1-plaintiff along with defendants Nos. 1 to 8 
constituted themselves into a partnership firm-defendant No.9 
namely “M/s Shiva Reddy & Brothers, B. Arjun Reddy & 

Co”(hereinafter being referred to as ‘firm’) on 10th October, 1983 to 
run a business of construction, film production, distribution, 
exhibition of cinemas, etc. Respondent No. 1-plaintiff preferred 
O.S. No. 121 of 19977 before the trial Court for dissolution of the 
firm-defendant No.9 and for a direction to defendant Nos. 1 to 5 to 
render accounts of the said firm and for payment of his share of 
profits and assets. 
29. A preliminary decree came to be passed in the said original 
suit on 26th October, 1988 directing that the firm-defendant No.9 
be dissolved and defendant Nos. 1 to 5 to tender accounts of the 
firm. Respondent No. 1- plaintiff was left at liberty to file separate 
applications for the appointment of Advocate Commissioner for 
taking the accounts in respect of the firm and for other appropriate 
reliefs. Being aggrieved, the defendant No. 1 and the firm-
defendant No. 9 preferred C.C.C. Appeal No. 40 of 1999 which 
came to be rejected vide judgment and decree dated 19th October, 
2001, however, a declaration was passed that respondent No. 1- 
plaintiff can seek rendition of accounts for a period of three years 
prior to the date of filing of the suit and not beyond that. 
 
7 O.S. No. 754 of 1991 later renumbered as O.S. No. 121 of 1997. 

30. Being aggrieved, defendant No. 1 and firm-defendant No. 9 
filed LPA No. 37 of 2002 challenging the said judgment and 
respondent No. 1-plaintiff filed LPA No. 48 of 2002 challenging the 
observation that respondent No. 1- plaintiff cannot seek rendition 
of accounts beyond a period of three years prior to filing of the suit. 
31. Learned Division Bench of the High Court of the Andhra 
Pradesh vide judgment dated 27th March 2014, dismissed the LPA 
No. 37 of 2002 preferred by defendant No. 1 and the firm-
defendant No. 9 and allowed the LPA No. 48 of 2002 preferred by 
respondent No. 1-plaintiff, which are assailed in these appeals by 
special leave. 
32. We have considered the submissions advanced by learned 
counsel for the parties and have gone through the impugned 
judgments and the material placed on record. 
Discussion and Conclusion: - 
33. Ex facie, learned counsel for the appellants could not satisfy 
the Court regarding the infirmity, if any, in the impugned judgment 
dated 27th March, 2014 in LPA No. 37 of 2002 and LPA No. 48 of 
2002 and decree in O.S No. 121 of 1997 dated 26th October, 1998, 
whereby the firm-defendant No. 9 namely “M/s Shiva Reddy & 

brothers, B. Arjun Reddy & Co” was directed to be dissolved and 
defendant Nos. 1 to 5 were directed to tender accounts of the firm. 
34. Three Courts of the competent jurisdiction have recorded the 
concurrent findings on facts in decreeing the suit in favour of 
respondent No. 1- plaintiff. Hence, this is not a fit case warranting 
interference in such a concurrent finding of facts in the exercise of 
the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the 
Constitution of India. 
35. Hence, the appeals fail and are dismissed. No costs. 
36. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
