RESPONDENT(S) 

JUDGMENT 
 
SANJIV KHANNA, J. 

The impugned judgment dated 26.10.2018 passed by the High Court 
of Judicature at Allahabad affirms the conviction of Lav Kumar anhiya in the chargesheets, First Information Report1 
No. 540/2011 dated 05.07.2011 for the offences punishable under 
Sections 364A, 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code, 18602, and FIR 
No. 582/2011 dated 05.07.2011 for the offences punishable under 
Section 4/25 of the Arms Act, 19593, both registered at Police Station 
– Sikandra, District – Agra, Uttar Pradesh. As the two FIRs arose 
from the same incident, the trial court consolidated and disposed of 
Session Trial Case Nos. 447/2011 and 448/2011 together. 
 
The deceased, Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky went missing on 
04.07.2011 and a report of kidnapping and ransom was filed, resulting 
in registration of FIR No. 540/2011 on 05.07.2011. The report refers 
to a telephonic call received by Ranjana Gupta, who has not been 
examined, on her mobile phone from a person who was using the SIM

card of the deceased, Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky. He had demanded a 
ransom of ₹50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty Lakh only). 
 
One Monu Saxena was statedly arrested on 06.07.2011 at about 
11.30 p.m. on the basis of Call Detail Records4 of the connected 
mobile phones kept under surveillance. However, he was found dead in 
police custody and lock-up on 07.07.2011 at about 7.45 a.m. 
 
We have examined the testimony of J.N. Asthana (PW-4), the 
first Investigating Officer, who arrested Monu Saxena. He accepted 
in his testimony that on surveillance of four mobile numbers belonging 
to Ranjana Gupta, Dinesh Goyal (complainant/father of the deceased), 
and two mobile numbers of the deceased, Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky, 
the name and mobile number of the appellant, Lav Kumar anhiya, 
came to notice on 06.07.2011. In spite of knowing the details of Lav 
Kumar anhiya, including the name and address of his father, Ashok 
Kumar Sharma, J.N.Asthana (PW-4) did not make any enquiries from him. 
 
The second Investigating Officer, Surya Kant Dwivedi (PW-8), 
in his cross-examination, stated that he could not remember whether 
on the intervening night of 8/9 July 2011, he had received the phone 
call regarding recovery of the dead body of Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky 
(deceased) on his mobile number or landline of the police station. 
In fact, he accepted the suggestion that he had not even seen the 
dead body of Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky (deceased). Further, he had 
gone to the place of recovery of the dead body on the pointing out 
of Arun Kumar Sharma, Inspector, Police Station – New Agra, Uttar 
Pradesh (PW-2). 

 For short, “CDRs”. 

A. No. 2294/2024 

Arun Kumar Sharma (PW-2) was not the Investigating Officer of 
this case. He claims that while on patrolling and search duty on 
08.07.2011, he received information from an informer regarding the 
whereabouts of the appellant, Lav Kumar anhiya, who was wanted in 
FIR No. 540/2011. The informer stated that the appellant, Lav Kumar 
anhiya, could be arrested, if immediate action is taken. The 
informer identified the appellant, Lav Kumar anhiya, who was then 
taken into custody. The appellant, Lav Kumar anhiya, then took 
Arun Kumar Sharma (PW-2) to an empty shop in Nandini Building 
Material, Nagla Padma, Gwalior Road, Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Upon entry 
into the said shop, a decomposed dead body was recovered. He then 
made a telephone call to the father of the deceased, Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky, namely, Dinesh Kumar Goyal, who deposed as PW-1 and 
whose statement, we will refer to, hereinafter. 
 
Interestingly, the panchanama of the dead body of Vivek Goyal 
icky/Vikky was prepared in the morning, at about 7.30 a.m. on 
09.07.2011. The aforesaid exercise was undertaken by the police 
officers from Police Station – Sadar Bazar, Agra, Uttar Pradesh. As 
noticed above, the second Investigating Officer, Surya Kant Dwivedi 
(PW-8), who had taken over investigation from the first Investigating 
Officer, J.N. Asthana (PW-4), on 07.07.2011 was not informed of the 
developments. Prosecution did not examine any witnesses from Police 
Station – Sadar Bazar. The prosecution has, however, examined Naresh 
Kumar Goyal (PW-6), a witness to the panchanama for recovery of the 
dead body. He deposed that he knows Dinesh Kumar Goyal (PW-1), the 
father of the deceased, Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky. In the morning of 

A. No. 2294/2024 

09.07.2011, Naresh Kumar Goyal (PW-6) had travelled from his 
residence 12-13 kms. away to reach the place of recovery, that is, 
the empty shop in Nandini Building Material, Nagla Padma, Gwalior 
Road, Agra. This was after information was given to him by the family 
of Dinesh Kumar Goyal (PW-1). 
 
It is clear from the deposition of J.N. Asthana (PW-4) that he 
had come to know about the mobile numbers, including the alleged 
possible involvement of Monu Saxena and Lav Kumar anhiya either 
in the evening/night of 05.07.2011 and certainly by morning hours of 
06.07.2011. The arrest of Monu Saxena is accepted and admitted by 
the prosecution. He remained in custody for about 12 hours, if not 
more than that. He had suffered several injuries, including injuries 
on his knees. There were also injury marks on his legs. 
 
J.N. Asthana (PW-4) was later on suspended and an FIR under 
Section 302 of the IPC was registered, albeit the final report has 
been accepted by the trial Court. 
 
It is an accepted position that the dead body of Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky was highly decomposed, and the entire room was smelling. 
As per the postmortem report (marked Exhibit ‘Ka.1’), Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky had died 4-5 days before the postmortem, which was 
conducted on 09.07.2011 at about 10.30 p.m. There is evidence that 
the property/building from where the dead body was recovered, was 
surrounded by other houses and residences. It is difficult to believe 
that the smell/stink emanating from the dead body, which was lying 
in the said property/building for 4-5 days, would have gone unnoticed. 
 
We have already commented upon the evidentiary value and our 

A. No. 2294/2024 

doubts on the time/place of panchanama and the deposition of Naresh 
Kumar Goyal (PW-6). The panchanama with regard to the recovery of 
the dead body, which was statedly recovered shortly after the 
purported arrest of Lav Kumar anhiya at 10.10 p.m. on 08.07.2011, 
was drawn up much later in the morning at around 7.30 a.m. on 
09.07.2011. 
 
The disclosure statement resulting in the recovery of the dead 
body at the behest of the appellant, Lav Kumar anhiya, is highly 
debatable, if not a pretence. We are not satisfied in the present 
case that any ‘disclosure’ can be attributed to the appellant, Lav 
Kumar anhiya, leading to the recovery of the dead body of the 
deceased, Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky. The arrest of the appellant, 
Lav Kumar anhiya, by Arun Kumar Sharma (PW-2) is also debatable. 
 
The prosecution also relies upon CDRs, for which, officers from 
the telecom companies, namely, Rajeev Singh Sanger and Awadh Jain, 
were examined as PW-9 and PW-10. However, they did not produce 
certificates under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Even 
if we are to ignore the non-production of the said certificates, the 
CDRs would only reveal that there were occasional conversations 
between the deceased, Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky and the appellant, 
Lav Kumar anhiya. The CDRs also reveal that Monu Saxena had used 
the SIM card of the deceased, Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky. However, 
the appellant, Lav Kumar anhiya, had not used the SIM card of the 
deceased, Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky. 
 
Dinesh Kumar Goyal (PW-1), the father of the deceased, Vivek 
Goyal icky/Vikky, has accepted that the appellant, Lav Kumar. No. 2294/2024 

Kanhiya, had worked in his garment shop for one year. His son, Vivek 
Goyal icky/Vikky, was acquainted with Lav Kumar anhiya. He had 
also accepted that Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky may be knowing Monu 
Saxena. A telephone call demanding ransom was made to Dinesh Kumar 
Goyal (PW-1) on 06.07.2011. Further, in his cross-examination, Dinesh 
Kumar Goyal (PW-1) accepted that Lav Kumar anhiya had not made 
the said call, as he would have recognized his voice. Dinesh Kumar 
Goyal (PW-1), in his cross examination, accepted that Monu Saxena 
had made a confession or disclosure statement before the police, and 
he was aware of the same. About his visit to the property/building, 
that is, Nandani Building Material, Nagla Padma, Gwalior Road, Agra, 
he stated that it was dark when he visited the spot. Further, by the 
time he reached the spot, the body of Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky was 
being put in a plastic kit. 
 
The appellant, Lav Kumar anhiya, was certainly acquainted 
and known to the deceased, Vivek Goyal icky/Vikky, but this would 
not be sufficient to convict him for the offences in question. 
 
The police also relied upon recovery of a knife at the behest 
of the appellant, Lav Kumar anhiya, but the said knife was 
recovered at least 13-14 days after the arrest of the appellant, Lav 
Kumar anhiya. The said recovery would not, in any way, change our 
opinion about the prosecution’s case. 
 
To safely opine and affirm that the appellant, Lav Kumar anhiya, is the perpetrator, we must ensure that the chain of evidence 
is so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the 
conclusion consistent with his innocence and must show that in all 

A. No. 2294/2024 

human probability the act must have been done by him.5 As highlighted 
above, the prosecution version leaves significant chinks and cracks 
in the chain of circumstances. In view of the aforesaid position, we 
feel that the prosecution evidence does not establish a case beyond 
doubt against the appellant, Lav Kumar anhiya. 
 
Accordingly, the impugned judgment is set aside and the appeal 
is allowed. The appellant, Lav Kumar anhiya, is acquitted of the 
charges under Sections 364A, 302 and 201 of the IPC as well as Section 
4/25 of the 1959 Act. 
 
Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
