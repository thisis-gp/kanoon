CRIMINAL APPEAL NO…………… OF 2024 
 SLP (CRL.) NO.16487 OF 2023 
VITHAL 

 …APPELLANT 
VERSUS 
THE STATE OF KARNATAKA …RESPONDENT 
 
ORDER 
 
1. Leave granted. 
 
2. This appeal was heard for admission, as a fresh 
case on 13.12.2023. While reserving orders, we 
had required Mr. S. Nagamuthu, learned senior 
counsel appearing for the appellant to submit 
written brief by 05.01.2024. The same has since 
been filed. 
 
3. Prima facie, we were inclined to dismiss the 
appeal, 
however, 
after 
considering 
the 
submissions, we feel that this appeal raises a 
substantial 
question 
which 
needs 
to 
be 

SLP(CRL.) NO. 16487 OF 2023 

addressed and decided by this Court. Since we 
had heard the matter at length and, also 
considered the written brief, we are referring to 
the brief facts of the case and the substantial 
question which arises in this appeal so that it 
may be of assistance at the time of final hearing 
of the matter. 
 
4. Four accused were charge sheeted for offences 
punishable under sections 341, 302 and 506 
read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 
18601. The Trial Court after considering the 
evidence led during the trial, convicted all the 
four accused for the offences punishable under 
sections 302, 341 and 506 read with section 34 
of the IPC vide judgment dated 22.11.2016 and 
further awarded sentence on 28.11.2016. In 
addition 
to 
the 
sentence 
to 
undergo 
imprisonment for life, they were also awarded 
other ancillary sentences. 
 
5. Two appeals were filed before the High Court 
against the conviction. Accused Nos.1 and 3 
 
1 IPC 

SLP(CRL.) NO. 16487 OF 2023 

joined together to file 
of 2016 whereas accused Nos.2 and 4 preferred. The High 
Court decided both the appeals by a common 
judgment dated 03.03.2021. It acquitted accused 
Nos.2, 3 and 4 for the offences under section 302 
IPC and convicted them under section 304 Part-
II IPC and sentenced them to 10 years rigorous 
imprisonment along with a fine of Rs. 5,000/-. 
Insofar as accused No.1 is concerned, his 
conviction and sentence was confirmed and the 
appeal was dismissed. 
 
6. Accused Nos.2,3 and 4 preferred Special Leave 
Petition Nos.6734-6735 of 2021, which were 
dismissed by this Court vide order dated 
17.09.2021. According to the Office Report dated 
13.12.2023, a 
of 2023 filed against the order dismissing the 
Special Leave Petitions is pending. However, 
subsequently the same has since been dismissed 
on 11.01.2024. Accused No.1 is the appellant in 
the present appeal. 

SLP(CRL.) NO. 16487 OF 2023 

7. The argument advanced by learned senior 
counsel which has appealed to us is that if 
section 34 IPC was applied, then, each one of the 
accused should have been convicted under the 
same provision and awarded the same sentence. 
Once the accused Nos.2, 3 and 4 were convicted 
under section 304 Part-II IPC and awarded 10 
years of rigorous imprisonment with Rs.5,000/- 
fine each, the same conviction and sentence 
should have been awarded to the appellant 
(accused No.1), otherwise, it would amount to 
travesty of justice. 
 
8. It would be relevant to mention here that as per 
the prosecution case, accused Nos. 2,3 and 4 had 
held the deceased whereas the appellant 
(accused No.1) had assaulted with a sickle on his 
head and neck, which injuries proved fatal. 
 
9. According to Mr. S. Nagamuthu, learned senior 
counsel, either all the four accused with the aid 
of section 34 IPC were liable to be convicted and 
sentenced under section 302 IPC or under 
section 304 Part-II IPC. 

SLP(CRL.) NO. 16487 OF 2023 

10. Although there are other arguments advanced by 
Mr. S. Nagamuthu with respect to self-defence 
and innocence of the appellant, but we are not 
inclined to entertain such arguments and we 
reject the same. The only argument which has 
appealed to us is with respect to section 34 IPC. 
 
11. Considering 
the 
limited 
question 
to 
be 
considered, we expedite the hearing. 
 
12. List for hearing on 13.03.2024.
