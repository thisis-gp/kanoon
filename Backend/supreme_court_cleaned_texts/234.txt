1. 
This batch of 76 appeals is at the instance of the Union of India being the 
unsuccessful respondent before the High Court and is directed against the 
common set of judgements and orders dated 23.02.2018 passed by the High Court 
of Allahabad in FAO Nos. 726, 730-739, 765, 772-793, 798-814, 825-826, 829-
830, 833-842, 844-848, and 850-855 respectively of 2014, by which the High 
Court allowed all the abovementioned appeals filed by the respondent herein 
(original appellant) and directed the railway administration to refund the 
difference of approx.. 110 km that was illegally levied towards the freight 
charges. 
 
A. 
FACTUAL MATRIX 
2. 
The respondent company herein had booked various consignments of 
furnace oil between the years 2002 & 2005 via railway from Baad to Hisar route. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

Indisputably the freight for the same was calculated by the appellant on the basis 
of a total chargeable distance of 444 km. as per the then prevailing distance table 
plying for the said route. 
 
3. 
On 07.04.2004, the Ministry of Railways vide its Letter No. 
TCR/2043/2002/2, decided to rationalize the method of calculating the 
‘chargeable distance’ between the pairs of station routes by way of rounding off 
the aggregate of the ‘actual engineering distance’ to the next higher kilometre 
only once at the end. The said letter is reproduced below: -

Rounding off of Chargeable Distance: Rationalization of 

fares and freight. 
REF: 
Board’s letter no. TCR/2043/2002/4 dated 05.02.2003 

Reference is invited to Board’s above cited letter wherein Zonal 
Railways were asked to print their new Local Distance Tables (LD1) and 
Junction Distance Tables (JDT) effective from April 1, 2003, indicating 
the actual engineering distances of the various sections upto two decimal 
places. Board desire confirmation in this regard and that these books 
have been printed and circulated to other railways also. 

It was also indicated in the letter under reference that the method 
of “rounding off” to be adopted for arriving at the ‘chargeable distance’ 
shall be communicated in due course. The Ministry of Railways have now 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

decided in rationalize the method for arriving at the ‘chargeable 
distance’ between a specific pair of originating and destination points. 
The actual engineering distances upto two decimal places of the various 
sections from originating station to destination station will be added up 
and the distance so aggregated would be finally rounded off to the next 
higher kilometre for deriving the chargeable distance. It may be ensured 
that for deriving the “chargeable distance”, the summation of individual 
sectional distances be “rounded off” only once at the end. This 
rationalization is aimed at ensuring uniformity in the method of deriving 
the distance of charging fares and freight for all customers across the 
Indian Railways. 

 In order to have a uniform date of implementation, all railways 
shall change over to the rationalized procedure with effect from 
01.06.2004. As these instructions have prospective effect and may result 
in variation in fares and freights when compared with the existing fares 
and freight, neither would any undercharges be raised by the railways 
nor would the railways refund charges collected in past cases. Rail users 
may be intimated of the proposed changes well in advance and staff may 
also be made well conversant with the changes contemplated. 

This issues in consultation with C&IS Directorate and with the 
concurrence of Finance Directorate in the Ministry of Railways.

4. 
This new methodology was being adopted in order to ensure uniformity in 
deriving the chargeable distance for fares and freight across the Indian Railways, 
and pursuant to it, the various zonal railways were required to revise their 
respective distance tables accordingly. 
 
5. 
The letter as referred to above specifically stipulated that, the change over 
to the new ‘rationalized procedure’ shall take place w.e.f. 01.06.2004 and further 
that as the aforementioned change might result in variation in the fares and 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

freights in comparison to the then existing charges / rates, the said change would 
not entitle either the Railways or the end-users to recover or seek any under-
charge or excess charge that was already paid prior to the implementation of the 
said policy. 
 
6. 
However, since many zonal railways were yet to print and make available 
their revised local distance tables and junction tables at their respective stations 
by the scheduled date of implementation, the Ministry of Railways vide its letter 
dated 24.09.2004 changed and moved the date of implementation of the aforesaid 
new methodology to 01.01.2005. It was further clarified that till the revised 
guidelines were implemented, the chargeable distance would continue to be 
calculated as per the earlier prevailing methodology and procedure as applicable.

Please refer to Board’s message dated 25.06.2006 wherein it was 
communicated that the revised procedure of charging fares and freight 
by rounding off the actual engineering distance only once at the end shall 
come into force from 01.10.2004. As all the Zonal Railways have not 
printed their local distance tables and junction distance tables by the 
target time, it has been decided that the revised procedure of charging 
fares and freight by rounding off the actual engineering distance only 
once at the end shall come into force from 01.01.2005 i.e., First January 
two thousand five. 

It has also been decided that till the implementation of revised 
guidelines, the earlier procedure for calculating the chargeable distance 
on the basis of old distance tables should be followed by Zonal Railways. 
Moreover, the receipt of LDTs/JDTs prepared on the basis of Board’s 
guidelines by concerned Railways should be intimated to this office.

On 05.07.2005, the Chief Commercial Manager of the North Central 
Railway Zone addressed a letter bearing No. DRM/CLAOG/RAD/Distance 
Table/2004/20 to the Chief Goods Supervisor (CGS), Baad inter-alia stating that 
the earlier chargeable distance of 444 km from the Refinery Baad to Hisar as per 
the old distance table should be changed to 334 km as per the new junction table, 
and that the “correct distance should be charged”. The said letter reads as under:

SUB: Charging of FO HPS Book from IOC BAAD to Hissar (HSR): 

As per old distance table prior to formation of Zone and Division, 
the distance, Refinery to HSR via TKD was being charged as under: - 
 
1. Refinery BAAD to BAAD station 
04 Km 
2. BAAD to TKD 
145 Km 
3. TKD to HSR 
295 Km 
Total 
444 Km 

As revised distance table of NCR, NR were not received, hence 
the charging was as per the earlier practice of 444 Km. These all the 
distance tables were critically reviewed from revised distance tables of 
NCR and the distance from IOC BAAD to HSR should be as under: - 
 
(A) The distance from IOC BAAD to HSR via PWL is as under: 
1. Refinery BAAD to BAAD station 
04 Km 
2. BAAD to TKD 
93.62 Km 
3. TKD to HSR 
235.56 Km 
Total 
333.18 Km 
 
(B) The distance from HSR via AWR is as under: 
1. Refinery BAAD to BAAD station 
04 Km 
2. BAAD to MTJ

3. AWR to RE 
74.21 Km 
4. RE to HSR 
142.56 Km 
Total 
354.17 Km 

As the traffic of FO and HPS is moving via PWL, hence the 
chargeable distance should be 334 Km. 

CGS has been instructed to change the distance of HSR according 
to the new junction distance table i.e., 334 Km. 

CGS BAAD has been instructed that the other disputed distance 
should also be corrected as per the new junction distance table and the 
correct distance should be charged.

8. 
The respondent upon learning about the aforesaid letter dated 05.07.2005 
changing the chargeable distance from 444 km to 334 km for the route from 
Refinery Baad to Hisar, made further inquiries with the concerned Railway office 
& came to learn that, although there had been no change in the physical track 
length for the said route and that the actual distance from Baad to Hissar via 
Palwal was in fact 333.18 km, yet the appellant was charging freight at a wrong 
chargeable distance of 444 km for the same route. 
 
9. 
In view of the aforesaid, the respondent company sent a notice of claim 
dated 07.11.2005 under Section 78B of the erstwhile Railways Act, 1890 (for 
short, the “Act, 1890”) to the appellant demanding refund of the difference of 
110 km in the freight charges that had been erroneously charged on the basis of 
the wrong chargeable distance which was subsequently changed. 
 
10. 
The respondent vide the aforesaid notice of claim had demanded refund for 
a total of 122 consignments for which freight had been levied on the basis of a 
chargeable distance of ‘444 km’. However, the appellant herein rejected all of 
the claims and declined to refund the 110 km difference in freight charges. 
 
B. 
PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE RAILWAY CLAIMS TRIBUNAL 
 
11. 
Aggrieved by the same, the respondent in all filed 122 claim applications 
under Section(s) 13(1)(b) r.w. 16(1) of the Railway Claims Tribunal Act, 1987 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

(for short, the “RCT Act”) for refund towards the difference of 110 km in freight 
charges, with the lead application being the OA/(III)/229/20006/Mathura before 
the Railway Claims Tribunal, Ghaziabad (“RCT”). 
 
12. 
During the pendency of the aforesaid claim applications, the respondent 
company held meetings with the appellant more particularly the General 
Manager, North Central Railway, Allahabad, who upon scrutinizing the matter 
allowed refund for inasmuch as 45 (sic) claims (approx..), which had been made 
within the statutory time period of 6-months under Section 78B of the Act, 1890 
– now Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989 (for short, the “Act, 1989”). 
 
13. 
The Railway Claims Tribunal, Ghaziabad vide its common final judgement 
and order dated 26.12.2013, dismissed the remaining 77 claim applications of the 
respondent as being time-barred. The said decision of the RCT is in two parts: - 

First, the RCT observed that though the chargeable distance was only 334 
km still the freight charges had been levied for a distance of 444 km. This 
according to the Tribunal was a case of excess payment of freight, and thus 
the refund that was sought was for an ‘overcharge’. The relevant 
observations read as under: - 
 
“18. [...] In this case, the goods were booked from ‘A’ to ‘B’, 
showing the chargeable distance as 444 Kms. and payment was 
given by the applicant company for the same distance, but later 
on, Railways reworked the chargeable distance as only 333.18 
Kms. The consignment in question was carried through the same 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

route. So, it is clear that the payment was to be made for 333.18 
Kms., whereas it was made for 444 Kms. In this way, the applicant 
company had to pay for 444 Kms, instead of 333.18 Kms. Hence, 
the present case is for the refund of this excess payment of freight, 
which can only be termed as refund of overcharge and nothing 
else and so, the notice under Section 106(3) of the Railways Act, 
1989 is necessary.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Secondly, since the case at hand was one for refund of an overcharge and 
the notice of claim had not been sent within the prescribed time-period of 
6-months as required under Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989, the claim 
application was time-barred. The relevant observations read as under: - 
 
“24. [...] Furthermore, perusal of the record shows that the 
applicant company had served a notice on 07.11.2005 upon the 
Respondent Railway, but the date of booking of the consignment 
in question was 25.08.2002. Hence, it has been revealed that the 
said notice was time barred as per the provisions of the aforesaid 
Section 106(3) of the Railways Act, 1989, which had been well 
within the knowledge of the applicant company also as per the 
aforesaid letter dated 28.01.2009. In this context, Ld. Counsel for 
the Respondent has placed reliance on the case law, titled as Birla 
Cement Works v. G.M., Western Railways & Anr., 1995 SCC (2) 
493. We have carefully perused the said case law and it supports 
the contention of the Respondent Railway. xxx

xxx 
 
26. In view of the above, it has been held the applicant company 
has not served a valid and legal notice on the Respondent Railway 
within the statutory period under the provisions of Section 106(3) 
of the Railways Act, 1989. As such, the applicant company is not 
entitled for any compensation. [...]” 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

14. 
Thus, the RCT, whilst dismissing the respondent’s claim applications held 
that, the respondent’s claim was for a refund of an overcharge and since the notice 
of claim was not served in terms of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989, the claim 
was time-barred. 
 
C. 
IMPUGNED ORDER 
 
15. 
Aggrieved with the aforesaid, the respondent went in appeal under Section 
23 of the RCT Act before the High Court of judicature at Allahabad. In all 76 
First Appeals from Order were filed, with the lead appeal being the FAO No. 843 
of 2014 wherein the High Court vide its judgement & order dated 23.02.2018 
allowed the aforesaid appeal, by placing reliance on the decision of this Court in 
Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. v. Union of India reported in (2018). The High Court took the view that since in the case at hand the freight had 
been paid as per the notified chargeable distance which was later found to be 
incorrect, it was a case of “illegal charge” and not that of “overcharge”. The 
relevant observations read as under: - 
 
“[...] In this case, the freight was paid by the appellant as per the notified 
distance and freight charges were paid accordingly. However, later on 
it was revealed that the distance was less and that is how the appellants 
had claimed the amount. This was one of the facts on which the Apex 
Court held in favour of the appellant (Hindustan Petroleum) and this 
was a question of illegal realisation of freight and not of over charging 
as submitted by the counsel for the respondent. [...] 
 
The finding of fact by the Tribunal dismissing the claim of the claimant 
is bad in the eye of law as held by the Apex Court in Hindustan 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

Petroleum (Supra), there was no need for issuance of notice. I am 
fortified in my view by both the decisions of the Apex Court in Hindustan 
Petroleum (Supra) and West Coast Paper Mills (Supra). Hence, this is 
not a case of over charge at all as the freight was paid as per the rates 
notified for certain distance. No other view can be taken in this matter. 
 
The judgment in Hindustan Petroleum (Supra) will enure for the benefit 
of the appellant in this case also. 
 
In view of the above, the appeal is allowed. The respondents to calculate 
the difference within 12 weeks from today and pay the appellant.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
16. 
Accordingly, the High Court vide the aforesaid judgement & order dated 
23.02.2018 disposed of the lead appeal of FAO No. 843 of 2014, and thereafter 
by a batch of common orders disposed of the other 75 appeals in terms of its 
findings recorded in the final judgement and order passed in the lead appeal. 
 
17. 
The aforesaid order dated 23.02.2018 as passed in FAO No. 843 of 2014 
i.e., the lead appeal was challenged and carried upto this Court by way of the. This Court vide its order 
dated 04.03.2021 refused to interfere with the order dated 23.02.2018 passed in 
FAO No. 843 of 2014 as the claim amount was very low. Thus, the said Special 
Leave Petition came to be dismissed by this Court, however the question of law 
was kept open. The relevant portion reads as under: - 
“ORDER 
 
We decline to interfere in this Special Leave Petition, as we find 
that the claimed amount is very low. The Special Leave Petition is 
dismissed accordingly, leaving the question of law open.” 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

18. 
In view of the aforesaid, the appellant herein being aggrieved, has 
challenged the final orders passed by the High Court in the other 75 appeals 
involving a total sum of Rs. 1,55,03,652/- (approx.). 
 
D. 
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 
19. 
Mrs. Rukhmini Bobde, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant in 
her written submissions has stated thus: - 
 
“WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 
 
1. The present Appeal has been filed against the final judgement of the 
Hon'ble High Court of Allahabad a batch of First Appeals, whereby the 
Hon'ble High Court has allowed all the abovementioned appeals filed by 
the Respondent-IOCL while relying upon the judgment dated 23.02.2018 
passed in First Appeal from Order No. 843 of 2014 (@pg. 79 of the 
present Appeal) which is illegal and perverse as the Hon'ble High Court 
has ignored to answer the questions of law. It is submitted that the order 
dated 23.02.2018 in First Appeal from Order No. 843 of 2014 was 
challenged by the Appellant-Union before this Hon'ble Court and the 
said petition bearing SLP(C) No. 3987 of 2021 was dismissed by this 
Hon'ble Court on 04.03.2021 on the ground that claim amount was very 
low. It is however submitted that the claim amount of all the batch 
matters herein comes to approximately Rs. 1,55,03,652/-. 
 
2. The facts of the lead case herein are that the Respondent-IOCL had 
sent a legal notice dated 07.11.2005 under Section 106 of the Railway 
Act, 1989 to the Appellant-Union for refund of excess freight charges 
with respect to a consignment dated 25.08.2022, due to change in 
methodology, having been applied prospectively from 01.01.2005 which 
resulted in variation in fares and freights when compared with the then 
existing fares and freight. It is submitted that the present Appeal is not a 
case of error in the existing notified freight change. 
 
3. The case of the Appellant-Union is that Section 106 of the Railway 
Act, 1989 does not apply to the present case at all since as per the 
circulars dated 07.04.2004 and 24.09.2004 (@page 141 and 144 of the 
Appeal respectively) issued by the Appellant-Union, the change in 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

distance happened due to rationalization of the distances, aimed at 
ensuring uniformity in the method of deriving the distance of charging 
fates and freight for all customers across Indian Railways. The 
rationalization was also directed to be applied prospectively (from 
01.01.2005 onwards) and the date of transport of consignment was on 
25.08.2002 i.e. more than 2 years before application of the circular. It is 
further submitted that the Appellant-Union in its circular dated 
07.04.2004 had specifically stated that the Appellant-Union would not 
be raising any issue of undercharges due to the variation nor was the 
Petitioner going to refund the charges collected in past cases, thus 
ensuring balance of convenience. Therefore, the question of 
overcharging does not arise at all as the Respondent-IOCL has been 
charged the freight charges as per the then prevailing existing fares and 
freights of the time and consequently, the Respondent-IOCL cannot raise 
any claim for compensation under Section 106 of the Railway Act, 1989. 
 
4. Even assuming and without admitting to the case of the Respondent-
IOCL, if the Respondent-IOCL is able to present a case for being 
overcharged and thus Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989 to be 
applicable, the case of the Respondent-IOCL is barred from raising any 
claim as per the provisions of Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989 on 
the ground of delay. 
 
5. It is also pertinent to take a close look at the facts of the following case 
laws: 
 
a. In Birla Cement Works v. G.M., Western Railways and 
Another', the Petitioner earlier used to transport through 
metre-gauge from the railway siding at Chanderia. 
However, after conversion into broad-gauge the railway 
siding was at Difthkola Chittor Broad-Gauge Rail Link, 
which lead to an increase of 34 km, which was added to the 
freight charges. The Petitioner had belatedly raised its 
claim under Section 78-B of the Railway Act, 1890 (pari 
materia to Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989) and were 
thus barred by limitation. 
 
The principal contention raised by the Petitioner was that 
it had discovered the mistake when the railway authorities 
confirmed by their letter that they had committed a mistake 
in charging excess freight on wrong calculation of distance. 
The limitation started running from the date of discovery 
and therefore stands excluded and that Section 78-B of the 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

Railway Act, 1890 had no application to the facts. However, 
this Hon'ble Court held that since admittedly the claims of 
the Petitioner were made under Section 78-B of the Railway 
Act, 1890 beyond a period of six months, the claim had 
become barred by limitation. 
 
It should be mentioned that the facts of Birla Cement would 
have only been applicable in the present Petition if there 
was a case of overcharging. However, as the Respondent 
had booked according to the prevailing freight charges at 
that time, the facts of Birla Cement does not arise at all. b. In Union of India and Others v. West Coast Paper Mills 
Ltd and Another (III), the Respondents were being 
charged a flat rate irrespective of the commodity carried 
and were not given the benefit of telescopic system of rates 
which was allowed by the Railways to others. This led to a 
scenario wherein the Respondents had to pay freight on 
certain goods at three times compared to what would have 
been payable in case the benefit of telescopic system of 
rates was allowed to them. This was construed to be an 
illegal and unreasonable charge. Reference is made to 
paragraph 20 of the Judgement: 
 
"20. In the case at hand, the freight rates notified by 
the Railway Administration in exercise of its statutory 
power to do so, so long as they were not declared 
illegal and unreasonable by the Tribunal under 
Section 41 of the Act, were legal and anyone carrying 
the goods by rail was liable to pay the freight in 
accordance with those rates. The freight paid by the 
respondents was as per the rates notified. Thus the 
present one is not a case of overcharge at all. It is a 
case of illegal recovery of freight on account of being 
unreasonable and in violation of Section 28 of the 
Act, consequent upon such determination by the 
Tribunal and the decision of the Tribunal having been 
upheld by this Court. A case of "illegal charge" is 
distinguishable from the case of "overcharge" and 
does not attract the applicability of Section 78-B of 
the Railways Act." 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

The facts are different from the present case as the 
Respondent-IOCL in the present case was only being 
charged the notified rates as per the prevailing rules at the 
time of booking. The Respondent-IOCL was aware of the 
freight charges at the time of booking. c. In Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited v. Union 
of India', the facts were different from the present case as 
the Railways had migrated to a computerized railway 
freight charges system from a manual system, which lead to 
decrease in the distance notified between Asaudah Railway 
Station, District Rohtak, Haryana and Partapur, District 
Meerut, Uttar Pradesh. 
 
It is submitted that this Hon'ble Court had correctly held 
that there was no overcharge and therefore Section 106 of 
the Railways Act, 1989 is not applicable. However, it is 
most humbly and respectfully submitted that as on merits 
there is no discussion in law as to whether any refund is 
payable dehors Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989. 
 
In the present case, the Appellant-Union had stated as per 
the circulars dated 07.04.2004 and 24.09.2004 that it 
would not be raising any issue of undercharging nor would 
be providing any refund and that the charges are 
prospective. 
 
6. Therefore, it is requested to allow the present Appeal and reverse the 
judgement of the Hon'ble High Court.” 

E. 
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
20. 
Mr. Shashwat Goel, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent in his 
written submissions has stated thus: - 
 
“WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
- M/S INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD 
 
A. RESPONDENT'S CASE/ ARGUMENTS IN BRIEF 
1. It is respectfully submitted that the present matter pertains to 'illegal 
charge' / 'illegal realization' of the freight amount by the Petitioner (i.e. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

the Railways) from the Respondent oil company. Admittedly, the 
Petitioner herein has charged the freight amount from the Respondent 
for a distance of 444 km, instead of 333.18 km between 'Baad' (BAD) 
station to 'Hissar' (HSR) station. This is nothing but 'illegal realization' 
of freight from the Respondent and it cannot be termed as 'overcharge'. 
It is submitted that there is a difference between 'illegal realization'/ 
'illegal charge' and 'overcharge' of freight amount. An 'overcharge' is 
something which is in excess of that what is due according to law and is 
paid by a party on account of mistake of fact. Whereas, 'illegal 
realization' / 'illegal charge' is excess realization of charges due to 
change in 'notified' distance or rates. 
 
2. It is submitted that the Petitioner has been calculating the freight 
amount for a distance of 444 km as it was 'notified' in the old distance 
table. Therefore, this cannot be termed as overcharge. Admittedly, upon 
realizing that the said distance was wrongly calculated, the appropriate 
authority of the Petitioner 'critically reviewed' the old distance tables 
and thereafter notified the corrected distance/ rate between BAD to HSR 
as 333.18 km on 05.07.2005 (i.e. Annexure P-3 g. 146 of SLP). This 
notification of corrected distance made the earlier realization of freight 
for 444 km under the erstwhile notified rates, illegal. Further, the cause 
of action for recovery of such illegal realization' of freight arose on 
05.07.2005, when the corrected distance was notified by the Petitioner. 
Immediately, the Respondent filed its claim petitions on 07.11.2005 for 
recovery of excess amount for the extra distance which was illegally 
realized by the Petitioner. 
 
3. The present case is squarely covered by a judgment of this Hon'ble 
Court passed in the matter of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited 
v. Union of India, (2018) (attached herewith). In the said 
case, the Petitioner therein (i.e. Hindustan Petroleum Corpn.) paid 
freight to the Railways (i.e. Petitioner herein) for the notified distance of 
125 km, between the period 01.04.2008 to 30.09.2010. Subsequently, the 
said distance of 125 km was corrected by the Railway to 100 km on 
27.02.2011. Immediately, HPCL filed its claim petitions on 30.03.2011, 
which were rejected as being time barred U/s 106(3) of the Railways Act, 
1989 by the Railways; Railways Tribunal & the High Court. When the 
said matter reached this Hon'ble Court, the Railways (i.e. the Petitioner 
herein) placed reliance on the judgment of this Hon'ble Court in Birla 
Cement Works, (1995) to buttress its argument that the claims 
filed by HPCL were barred U/s 106(3) of the Railways Act. It is 
submitted that the said judgment of Birla Cement Works was 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

distinguished by this Hon'ble Court and it was held that excess 
realization of freight by the Railways from HPCL was 'illegal' and 
therefore HPCL's claims were allowed. It was further held that there was 
no requirement of giving any notice under Section 106 of the Railways 
Act as there was no overcharge by the Railways. The findings of this 
Hon'ble Court in HPCL's case are as follows: 
 
"8. Birla Cement Works [Birla Cement Works v. Western 
Railways, (1995) ] was a case where the 
petitioner therein (i.e. Birla Cement Works) came to know of 
the alleged excess amount of freight on wrong calculation of 
distance through a letter dated 12-10-1990 issued by the 
Railway authorities. This primary fact is conspicuously 
absent in the present case. In the present case what was paid 
was as per the fixed rate on the basis of notified distance 
which subsequently was corrected by another Notification 
upon introduction of the Terminal Mechanism System (TMS) 
at Asaudah Railway Station, District Rohtak, Haryana. 
 
9. On the other hand, in West Coast Paper Mills Ltd. [Union of India v. 
West Coast Paper Mills Ltd., (2004) ] this Court in para 20 
of the said Report took the view that as the freight paid was as per the 
rates notified the case would not be one of overcharge at all. If that is 
the view taken by this Court on an interpretation of the pari materia 
provision in the erstwhile Act i.e. the Railway Act, 1890 (i.e. Section 78-
B) we do not see why, in the facts of the present case which are largely 
identical, we should be taking any other view in the matter. 
 
10. Consequently and in the light of the above, we allow the present 
appeals, set aside the order of the High Court as well as that of the 
Railway Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh and allow the claims of the 
appellant which will be paid forthwith on due and proper calculation." 
 
B. SUBMISSIONS ON THE ISSUES FRAMED BY THIS HON'BLE 
COURT 
 
Issue No.1 - What is the scope of Section 106 of the Railway Act, 1989, 
and if the said provision is applicable to the present case at hand? 
 
(i) It is submitted that Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989 stipulates 
that a 'Notice has to be sent to the Railways within six months for: (a) 
'claim for compensation' (under sub-section (1) & (2)); & (b) for 'refund 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

of overcharge' (under sub-section (3)). It is clear from a bare reading of 
this section that a notice cannot be sent to the Railways for any other 
purpose/ for raising a claim under any other head which is not mentioned 
in the said section. The term(s) 'illegal charge' / 'illegal realization of 
freight' is not mentioned in S.106. Therefore, there is no legal 
requirement of sending a notice under S.106 for raising a claim on 
account of 'illegal charge' / ‘illegal realization' of freight. It is pertinent 
to mention here that a claim of illegal charge' will not fall under the 
category of overcharge as undisputedly, there is a difference between the 
terms - 'overcharge' and 'illegal charge'. 
 
(ii) In this regard, reliance is placed upon a judgment of this Hon'ble 
Court passed in the matter of Union of India & Ors. v. West Coast Paper 
Mills Ltd. & Anr. (IlI), (2004) (attached herewith). In the said 
case, an interpretation of the pari materia provision (like S.106) in the 
erstwhile Act i.e. the Railway Act, 1890 (i.e. Section 78-B) was done by 
this Hon'ble Court. While considering the distinction between an 
'overcharge' and 'illegal charge' for the purposes of Section 78-B of the 
Railways Act, 1890 (i.e. same as Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989), 
it was held by this Hon'ble Court that: 
 
"20.... A case of "illegal charge" is distinguishable from the case of 
"overcharge" and does not attract the applicability of Section 78-B of 
the Railways Act." 
 
It is pertinent to mention here that this Hon'ble Court has also analysed 
in detail the meaning of the term 'overcharge' in Para 19 of the above-
mentioned judgment. 
 
(iii) It is reiterated that the present matter pertains to 'illegal charge' / 
'illegal realization' and not of overcharge' of the freight amount. 
Therefore, in view of the aforesaid submissions, it is submitted that the 
provision of Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989 is not applicable upon 
the present case. In this regard, reliance is also placed upon paras 8-10 
of the judgment of this Hon'ble Court passed in Hindustan Petroleum 
Corporation Limited's case (supra). 
 
Issue No.2 - Whether the decision of this Court in Birla Cement Works 
vs. G.M. Western Railways (1995) is applicable to the case at hand? 
 
(i) It is respectfully submitted that the decision of this Hon'ble Court in 
Birla Cement Works is not applicable upon the present case. Pertinently, 
the said decision has already been distinguished by this Hon'ble Court 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

in the subsequent case of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited 
(supra), which is identical to the present case. 
 
(ii) The case of Birla Cement Works pertains to refund of 'overcharge' 
which was made by the Railways. Whereas, the present case is that of 
recovery of ‘illegally realized' freight from the Railways. 
 
(iii) In the case of Birla Cement Works, the Railways had charged excess 
freight from the Petitioner therein (i.e. Birla Cement), than what was 
stipulated in distance table (i.e. overcharge). Whereas, in the present 
case, the Railways (i.e. the Petitioner) had realized the freight amount 
from the Respondent on the basis of the distance, i.e. 444 km, that was 
notified in the erstwhile distance table which subsequently got corrected 
& was notified by the Railways as 333.18 km (i.e. illegal realization of 
freight). 
 
(iv) In the case of Birla Cement Works, the Petitioner therein (i.e. Birla 
Cement) came to know of the alleged excess amount of freight on account 
of wrong calculation of distance through the letter issued by the 
Railways. It was not the case where the distance was corrected and re-
notified by the Railway authorities. In Birla Cement Works, there was a 
mistake by the Railways in calculating the freight amount by wrongly 
taking into account the distance that was stipulated in the distance table 
in that case. It is submitted that the said mistake/ error was of such a 
nature that even the Petitioner therein (i.e. Birla Cement) could have 
also found, had it been diligent. Instead, it kept paying the freight 
charges to the Railways and filed its claim only when the Railways 
informed it that the same was wrongly calculated. Whereas, in the 
present case, the Respondent has paid the freight charges as per the 
distance of 444km notified in the erstwhile distance table, which later on 
stood corrected; notifying the distance as 333.18 km. In the present case, 
Respondent was not sleeping over its rights. The Respondent filed its 
claims soon after the corrected distance was notified by the Petitioner 
herein and the Respondent came to know about the illegal charge. There 
is no sort of lack of vigilance or bona fides of the Respondent in the 
present case. 
 
Issue No.3 - What was the reason for revising the freight charges? In 
other words, whether the revision of freight charges was done pursuant 
to a new methodology being adopted or due to an error in the existing 
notified freight charges? 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

(i) It is submitted that the freight charges/ the distance between BAD 
station to HSR station was revised / corrected by the Petitioner vide its 
notification dt.05.07.2005 (Annexure P-3 g.146 of the SLP). The said 
revision/ correction was carried out after 'critically reviewing' the old 
distance tables with the revised distance tables of the North Central 
Railways (NCR). It is clearly stated in the said notification that the 
earlier notified distance of 444 km was used for calculating the freight 
as the revised distance table of NCR, despite being available, was not 
received earlier. This clearly shows lapses on part of the Petitioner. 
Despite being aware that the revised distance tables had come for the 
NCR, the same were not considered and the Petitioner continued 
calculating the freight as per the old distance, which is illegal. 
 
(ii) It is further submitted that there is no change in the tracks or route 
from BAD to HSR. It appears that the wrong distance was notified in the 
old table, that is why there was a need to critically review the same 
before notifying the corrected distance. 
 
4. It is pertinent to mention here that the Petitioner has made a subtle 
attempt to mislead this Hon'ble Court by introducing circulars 
dt.07.04.2004 & 24.09.2004 in its SLP. The Petitioner has used the said 
circulars to erroneously allege that the change of distance was to be 
applied prospectively from date mentioned in the said circulars. In this 
regard it is submitted that the said circulars do not pertain to change of 
distance. The said circulars stipulate the guidelines for rounding off the 
chargeable distance upto two decimal places. Even the file no. of the said 
circulars is completely different from the notification issued on 
05.07.2005, whereby the corrected rates were notified between BAD & 
HSR. The file no. of the circulars dt. 07.04.2004 & 24.09.2004 is 
TCR/2043/2000/2, whereas, for the notification dt.05.07.2005, it is 
DRM/CLAOG RAD/ Distance Table/2004/20. It is submitted that this 
fact in itself makes it clear that the subject matter of the circulars dt. 
07.04.2004 & 24.09.2004 and notification dt.05.07.2005 are totally 
distinct and separate and the said circulars have no bearing upon the 
present case. 
 
5. It is also pertinent to mention here that there is an unexplained delay 
of 661 days in filing the SLP by the Petitioner. 
 
In the light of the aforementioned submissions, it is humbly prayed that 
the present SLP filed by the Petitioner be dismissed.”

F. 
ANALYSIS 
 
21. 
Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone 
through the materials on record, the following pivotal questions fall for our 
consideration: - 
I. 
What is the scope of Section 106 sub-section (3) of the Railways Act, 
1989? In other words, what constitutes an “overcharge” within the 
meaning of Section 106 sub-section (3) of the Railways Act, 1989? What 
is the difference between an “Overcharge” and an “Illegal Charge”? 
II. 
Whether, the claim towards the refund of difference of 110 km in freight 
charges is covered by Section 106 sub-section (3) of the Railways Act, 
1989? In other words, Whether the claim is for a refund of an 
‘overcharge’? 
III. 
Whether, the difference of 110 km in freight is liable to be refunded? In 
other words, whether the notified chargeable distance of ‘444 km’ was an 
Illegal Charge or not? i. 
Relevant Statutory Scheme and Provisions 
 
22. 
Earlier, in India the law pertaining to the railways was scattered into several 
enactments and executive orders, each regulating different aspects of the railways 
throughout the country. The reason behind the multiple different legislations on 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

the railways was the number of changes that were rapidly taking place due to the 
expansion and establishment of various railway corridors across the country. 
 
23. 
The Indian Railways Act, 1890 was the first prominent legislation to be 
passed to consolidate the law and embody all important provisions relating to the 
railways. The Act, 1890 since its enactment remained the sole substantive 
legislation for regulating railways in India for nearly half a century. 
 
24. 
Despite being amended several times, the Act, 1890 was not able to keep 
pace with the changes that were rapidly taking place in the Indian railway 
infrastructure and network. Over the course of time, several committees were 
constituted with a view to streamline the functioning of Indian Railways and meet 
the challenges of changing times. Various recommendations were made to the 
Government by these committees, with the most significant one being the 
complete reorganization of the railway into several operational zones. 
 
25. 
Due to large and sweeping nature of the changes recommended, the Act, 
1890 required an extensive revision, something which could not be done by 
amendment, and thus, a new exhaustive Act was required for the consolidation 
and nationalization of the Indian Railways. 
 
26. 
Accordingly, the Railways Act 1989 came to be enacted with a view to 
amend and consolidate the legislation relating to the Railways and to replace the 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

erstwhile Indian Railways Act, 1890. The statement of objects and reasons of the 
Act, 1989 reads as under: - 
 
“STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 
 
The Indian Railways, Act, 1890 was enacted at a time when the railways 
in India were mostly managed by private companies. The Government of 
India primarily played the role of a coordinating and regulating 
authority in various matters, such as inter-railway movement of traffic, 
fixation of rates, sharing of revenue, earnings of through traffic, 
apportionment of claims liability amongst the railways, providing 
reasonable facilities to passenger and goods traffic, etc. This role was 
accordingly reflected in the Act. But now, except for a very small portion 
of the railways, the entire railway system has become part of the 
Government of India. To give effect to the changes in the railway system 
from time to time, the Act had also undergone changes number of times 
since its enactment in 1890. In addition, as some of the original 
provisions enacted in 1890 had continued without any change, a need 
for their replacement by new provisions more responsive to the needs of 
the present day was felt and some other provisions have become 
redundant. There has also been a demand, both within and outside 
Parliament, for the re-enactment of the Act so as to reflect the large 
number of changes that have occurred in the railways. It has, therefore, 
become necessary to consolidate and amend the law relating to railways 
by a new act. 
 
2. The Bill, while giving effect to the changes that are necessary due to 
the change of circumstances, provides, among other things, for the 
following matters, namely: - 

The railways are being administered by zonal railways. This 
position had not been given effect to in the Act. The Bill provides 
for the constitution of railway zones, abolition of existing zones 
and appointment of General Managers as heads of these railways 
administrations. 

Power has been given to the Central Government to fix the rates 
for the carriage of passengers and goods over the railways instead 
of the existing provisions to fix only the maximum and minimum 
rates for such carriage and leaving the fixation of specific rates to 
the 
railway 
administrations. 
In 
addition, 
the 
railway 
administrations are also being authorised to specify lump sum 
rates for the carriage of goods. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

In accordance with certain judicial pronouncements, the Bill 
provides for statutory recognition of the railway receipt as a 
negotiable instrument. 

The Bill specifically provides for limiting the monetary liability of 
railway administrations in respect of payment of compensation of 
loss, damage, etc. of goods. Provision has, however been made for 
full liability subject to the condition that the consignor while 
entrusting the goods to a railway administration for carriage, 
should declare the value of the goods and pay a percentage charge 
on such value. 

The offences included in the Act have been rationalised and a few 
new offences have also been included in the Bill. Punishment for 
some of the offences had not been changed since the enactment of 
the Act. Penalties provided for the offences under the Act have 
been made more stringent which would include, among other 
things, a minimum punishment for many of the offences. 
 
3. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objects.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 

27. 
The Act, 1989 is a consolidating and amending legislation relating to the 
Railways which received assent and came into force on 03.06.1989 replacing the 
erstwhile Act, 1890 by virtue of the repealing provision contained in Section 200 
of the Act, 1989. The Act, 1989 is divided into 16 Chapters and 200 Sections. 
Chapter XI of the Act, 1989 sets out the provisions (Section(s) 93 to 112) relating 
to the Responsibilities of Railway Administration as Carriers, and it deals with 
claims for refund and compensation in respect of the goods carried by railway. 
 
28. 
In addition to the aforesaid statute, the Railway Claims Tribunal Act, 1987 
was also enacted for the establishment of the Railway Claims Tribunal with a 
view to provide the procedural framework and forum for inquiry, determination 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

and adjudication of claims against the railway administration. The statement of 
objects and reasons of the RCT Act reads as under: - 
 
“STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 
 
An Act to provide for the establishment of a Railway Claims Tribunal for 
inquiring into and determining claims against a railway administration 
for loss, destruction, damage, deterioration or non-delivery of animals 
or goods entrusted to it to be carried by railway or for the refund of fares 
or freight or for compensation for death or injury to passengers 
occurring as a result of railway accidents or untoward incidents] and 
for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.” 
 
29. 
Section 13 of the RCT Act provides that the Railway Claims Tribunal shall 
inter-alia exercise powers and jurisdiction under Chapter VII of the erstwhile 
Act, 1890 (now Chapter XI of the Act, 1989) pertaining to inquiry and 
determination of claims for compensation for loss, destruction, damage etc. and

(2) The provisions of the Railways Act, 1989 (24 of 1989) and the rules 
made thereunder shall, so far as may be, be applicable to the inquiring 
into or determining, any claims by the Claims Tribunal under this Act.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
30. 
Section 15 of the RCT Act bars the jurisdiction of courts and other 
authorities from entertaining or exercising any power in respect of matters 
referred to in Section 13 of the RCT Act. The said provision reads as under: - 
 
“15. Bar of jurisdiction. — 
On and from the appointed day, no court or other authority shall have, 
or be entitled to, exercise any jurisdiction, powers or authority in 
relation to the matters referred to in sub-sections (1), (1A) and (1B) of 
section 13.” 
 
31. 
Section 16 of the RCT Act provides that an application may be made to the 
Railway Claims Tribunal for any claim of compensation or refund from the 
railway administration as provided under Section 13 of the said Act. The said 
provision reads as under: - 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

“16. Application to Claims Tribunal. —

Provided that no such fee shall be payable in respect of an application 
under sub-clause (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) or, as the case may 
be, sub-section (1A)] of section 13.” 

32. 
Section 23 of the RCT provides for a statutory appeal on both a question 
of fact and law, to the High Court against any order passed by the Railway Claims 
Tribunal. The said provision reads as under: - 
 
“23. Appeals. — 
(1) Save as provided in sub-section (2) and notwithstanding anything 
contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) or in any 
other law, an appeal shall lie from every order, not being an

(2) No appeal shall lie from an order passed by the Claims Tribunal with 
the consent of the parties. (3) Every appeal under this section shall be

33. 
Section 17 sub-section (2) of the RCT Act inter-alia provides that no 
application for claim of compensation or refund from the railway administration 
shall be entertained by the tribunal, until the expiry of three-months from the date 
on which the notice of claim was made in accordance with Section 78B of the 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

erstwhile Act, 1890 (now Section 106 of the Act, 1989). The said provision reads 
as under: - 
 
“17. Limitation. —

Provided that no application for any claim referred to in sub-clause 
(i) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 13 shall be preferred to 
the Claims Tribunal until the expiration of three months next after the

section 78B of the Railways Act. 
 
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), an 
application may be entertained after the period specified in sub-section 
(1) if the applicant satisfies the Claims Tribunal that he had sufficient 
cause for not making the application within such period.” 
 
ii. 
Scope of Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989 
 
34. 
In the present lis, we are concerned with Section 106 of the Act, 1989, 
which is pari-materia to Section 78B of the erstwhile Act, 1890. Section 106 
deals with notice for claim of compensation and refund of overcharge. The said 
provision reads as under: - 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

“106. Notice of claim for compensation and refund of overcharge. – 
(1) A person shall not be entitled to claim compensation against a 
railway administration for the loss, destruction, damage, deterioration 
or non-delivery of goods carried by railway, unless a notice thereof is 
served by him or on his behalf,— 
(a) to the railway administration to which the goods are entrusted 
for carriage; or 
(b) to the railway administration on whose railway the destination 
station lies, or the loss, destruction, damage or deterioration 
occurs. within a period of six-months from the date of entrustment of the goods. 
 
(2) Any information demanded or enquiry made in writing from, or any 
complaint made in writing to, any of the railway administrations 
mentioned in sub-section (1) by or on behalf of the person within the said 
period of six months regarding the non-delivery or delayed delivery of 
the goods with particulars sufficient to identify the goods shall, for the 
purpose of this section, be deemed to be a notice of claim for 
compensation. 
 
(3) A person shall not be entitled to a refund of an overcharge in respect 
of goods carried by railway unless a notice therefor has been served by 
him or on his behalf to the railway administration to which the 
overcharge has been paid within six months from the date of such 
payment or the date of delivery of such goods at the destination station, 
whichever is later.” 
 
35. 
A close reading of the aforesaid provision would indicate that Section 106 
of the Act, 1989 is in two-parts and deals with and encompasses two distinct 
types of claims that may be made or sought against the railway administration by 
way of a notice: - 

First¸ the claims towards the ‘compensation’ from the railway 
administration which has been provided under Section 106 sub-section (1). 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

The compensation may be sought in respect of any loss or damage or 
destruction caused to the goods which were being carried by the railway. 

Secondly, the claims towards the refund of any ‘overcharge’ that has been 
levied in respect of any goods which were being carried by the railways, 
and this has been provided under Section 106 sub-section (3). 
 
36. 
Thus, Section 106 of Act, 1989 contains the statutory provisions that 
enables any person to make a claim from the railway administration, either for 
(i) compensation OR for (ii) refund of overcharge, in respect of any goods which 
were being carried by the railway by sending a notice of claim. 
 
37. 
Apart from containing the enabling provision for making a claim, Section 
106 further provides when such a claim may be made. Section 106 sub-section 
(1) provides that a claim for compensation may be made where there has been a 
loss or damage or destruction or deterioration or non-delivery of the goods that 
were being carried by the railway. Whereas, Section 106 sub-section (2) provides 
that a claim for refund may be made where there has been an overcharge in 
respect of the goods carried and the said overcharge was paid to the railway 
administration. 
 
38. 
Lastly, Section 106 also provides how a claim may be made and the mode 
& manner in which the notice must be made by stipulating a pre-condition in the 
form of a prescribed time-limit for making any claim thereunder: - 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

Section 106 sub-section (1) prescribes twin-conditions for a Notice of 
Claim for Compensation and provides that such notice must be made 
within a period of 6-months from the date of entrustment of goods AND 
the notice must be served to the Railway Administration to whom the 
goods were entrusted. 

Similarly, Section 106 sub-section (3) also stipulates twin-conditions for 
making a Notice of Claim for Refund of Overcharge and provides that such 
notice must be made within a period of 6-months from either the date of 
payment of such overcharge or the date of delivery of the goods in respect 
of which the overcharge was paid AND that the notice must be served to 
the railway administration to whom the overcharge was paid. 
 
39. 
Thus, a statutory time-period of 6-months has been provided for making a 
notice of claim under Section 106 of the Act, 1989, and if the notice of claim is 
not made within the stipulated period, then the claim becomes time-barred. 
 
40. 
The High Court of Gujarat in its decision in Shah Raichand Amulakh v. 
Union of India & Ors. reported in (1971) 12 GLR 93 had observed that the object 
behind the time-limit prescribed under Section 78B of the 1890 Act (now Section 
106 of the Act, 1989) is to prevent stale or dishonest claims from being made, 
which if otherwise allowed would make it difficult to enquire into their merits 
due to lapse of time. The relevant observations read as under: - 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

“3. [...] the object of service of notice under this provision clearly is to 
enable the railway administration to make an inquiry and investigation 
as to whether the loss, destruction or deterioration was due to the 
consignor's laches or to the wilful neglect of the railway administration 
and its servants and further to prevent stale and possibly dishonest 
claims being made when, owing to delay, it may be practically 
impossible to trace the transaction or check the allegations made by the 
consignor or the consignee. It is, therefore, apparent that the provision 
requiring that notice of claim must be given within six months even where 
the claim is for refund of an overcharge in respect of animals or goods 
carried by railway is intended to prevent stale and perhaps dishonest 
claims being made when, by reason of lapse of time, it may not be 
possible to inquire and find out whether the claim made is well-founded 
or not. [...]” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
41. 
Shah Raichand Amulakh (supra), further held that the term “overcharge 
in respect of carriage of goods” used in Section 78B of the 1890 Act (now 
Section 106 of the Act, 1989) means and includes all such charges that are related 
to the railway’s carrier business and those which are incidental to the carriage of 
the goods by railway irrespective of whether they are incurred prior to or 
subsequent to the railway transit, and thus would include loading and unloading 
of goods. The relevant observations read as under: - 
 
“3. [...] To bring the claim for refund within the mischief of the section, 
the overcharge must be in respect of goods carried by railway. The 
words "carried by railway" qualify goods and if any overcharge is 
recovered in respect of goods which satisfy this description, it would be 
"overcharge" by the railway administration in respect of demurrage and 
wharfage charges, it is according to the plain and natural meaning of 
the words, an overcharge in respect of goods which are carried by 
railway. 1 do not think it is possible to limit the ambit and coverage of 
the section by reading the words "overcharge in respect of goods carried 
by railway" as indicating that the overcharge must be in respect of 
carriage of the goods. To read these words in such a manner would be 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

to refuse to give effect to their plain natural meaning and to rewrite the 
section by substituting some such words as "overcharge in respect of 
carriage of goods." That would be clearly impermissible under any 
cannon of construction. 
 
4. [...] Demurrage and wharfage charges are thus clearly terminal 
charges and though it is true that they are charges in respect of the 
period subsequent to the completion of the transit, all the same, they are 
incidental to the business of the railway administration as a carrier. 
These charges are, therefore, not unrelated to the business of a carrier 
carried on by the railway administration. The railway administration 
makes these charges because there is delay in unloading the wagon or 
removing the goods from the platform. These are clearly charges in 
respect of the goods carried by railway as much as freight and other 
charges. If, therefore, there is any overcharge made by the railway 
administration in respect of demurrage and wharfage charges, a claim 
for its refund would clearly come within the scope and ambit of Section 
77. It would be a claim for refund of an overcharge in respect of goods 
carried by railway within the meaning of that section.”

The Orissa High Court in Union of India & Ors. v. Steel Authority of 
India Ltd. reported in (1996) SCC OnLine Ori 60, while examining Section 78B 
of the Act, 1890, made the following pertinent observations which are 
reproduced as under: - 
 
“12. [...] What this section provides for is, apart from claim for 
compensation for the loss, a claim for refund of overcharge to a person 
in respect of animals or goods carried by the Railways. The condition 
precedent for making such a refund is that the person should have 
preferred a claim in writing for such overcharge or compensation within 
six months of the date of delivery of the animals or goods for being 
carried by the Railway.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

43. 
Thus, it can be seen from above that when it comes to a Notice for Claim 
for Refund of Overcharge under Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 the following 
conditions must be fulfilled: - 
a. Claim must be for refund of an ‘Overcharge’, 
b. Overcharge must have been paid to the Railway Administration in 
respect of the goods carried by the railway 
c. Notice must be issued within 6-months from the date of payment or 
delivery of goods for which overcharge was paid, and 
d. Notice must be served to the concerned railway administration to 
whom the overcharge was paid. 
 
44. 
Thus, the rigours of Section 106 sub-section (3) i.e., the 6-month time-
period for making a notice of claim, is only attracted, when the refund is for an 
overcharge. Whenever, an application is made under Section 16 of the RCT Act 
for refund, what needs to be seen is whether the same is for a refund of an 
overcharge or not? If the claim is for an overcharge, Section 106 sub-section (3) 
would be applicable. a. 
What is meant by an “Overcharge”? 
 
45. 
At this stage, it would be apposite to understand what is meant by the term 
“overcharge” used in Section 106 of the Act, 1989. The term “overcharge” has 
neither been defined in the Act, 1989 nor the erstwhile Act, 1890. The term 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

“overcharge” is derived from the word ‘charge’ prefixed by the word ‘over’ and 
means “something more than the correct amount or more than a certain limit”. 
The Black’s Law Dictionary has defined “overcharge” as follows [See: Henry 
Campbell Black on ‘Black’s Law Dictionary’, 4th Edn., 1968 at Pg. 1610]: - 
“an exaction, impost, or incumbrance beyond what is just and right or 
beyond one’s authority or power.” 

46. 
The Law Lexicon has defined the term “overcharge” as “a charge of a sum, 
more than is permitted by law”. [See, P. Ramanatha Aiyar on ‘The Law Lexicon’, 
2nd Edn., 1997 at Pg. 1389]. 
 
47. 
The term “overcharge” as used in Section 78B of the Act, 1890 (now 
Section 106 of the Act, 1989) was first interpreted by the Gujarat High Court in 
Shah Raichand Amulakh (supra) to mean any charge in excess of what is 
prescribed or permitted or due by law. It was further held, that for a sum to be an 
overcharge, it must be of the same character as the charge itself or of the same 
genus of charge. Accordingly, the High Court held that the demurrage and 
wharfage charges that had been levied on a consignment in excess of what was 
permissible under the law was an overcharge under Section 78B. The relevant 
observations read as under: - 
 
“2. [...] "Overcharge" is not a term of Article It is an ordinary word of 
the English language which according to its plain natural sense means 
any charge in excess of that prescribed or permitted by law. To be an 
overcharge, a sum of money must partake of the same character as the 
charge itself or must be of the same genus of or class as a charge; it 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

cannot be any other kind of money such as money recovered where 
nothing is due. Overcharge is simply a charge in excess of that which is 
due according to law.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
48. 
In yet another decision of the Gujarat High Court in Union of India v. 
Mansukhlal Jethalal reported in (1974) SCC OnLine Guj 12 the scope of 
Section 78B of the Act, 1890 (now Section 106 of the Act, 1989) came to be 
examined. In the said case, the Railway besides the freight was levying new 
charge in the form of shunting charges etc. It was contended that since, the freight 
encompassed the terminal charges for shunting, the additional charges being 
levied was arbitrary and illegal. The High Court held that since the additional 
charges were not being levied in excess of the prescribed charges, but were an 
altogether a different charge, the same could not be termed as an overcharge and 
thus, Section 78B of the Act, 1890 was not attracted and no notice of claim was 
required. The relevant observations read as under: - 
 
“2. The trial Court has held that it has got jurisdiction to entertain this 
suit. It is also held that no claim notice as contemplated under Section 
78-B of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 (which will be hereinafter referred 
to as "the Act"), was necessary as it was not a case of recovery of over 
charges. Non-giving of such a notice, therefore, was not fatal to the suit. 
The material averments made in the plaint are, that the plaintiff booked 
salt from Kuda Salt Siding Station, on the line of Western Railway 
Administration, owned and represented by the Union of India (original 
defendant), to salt merchants at Dhrangadhra and at various other 
stations. That the said salt consignments are booked in wagon loads from 
Kuda Salt Siding Station. In para 12 it is averred that since 1-6-1961 the 
Western Railway Administration, in addition to charging usual freight 
on goods, traffic from and to Kuda Salt Siding Station, wrongly, illegally, 
arbitrarily and unreasonably levied an additional new charge by- way 
of siding charges or shunting charges or placement of wagon charges or 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

removal of wagon charges. In paras 13 to 18, reference is made 
regarding the increases made, in those charges from time to time and 
such collections made. In para 26, it is averred that the, defendant 
Western Railway Administration charged freight on the wagon load salt 
consignment of the plaintiff from Kuda Salt Siding Station to destination 
and the said freight includes terminal charges for shunting, placement 
and removal of wagons at the place where, the salt, to be loaded, is 
stacked and hence the defendant-Western Railway Administration, in 
addition to freight, is not entitled to levy new charge with effect from 1-
6-61 either as siding charges or as shunting charges or as placement 
charges or as removal charges or under the pretext of any other charge 
and the levy of the said new charge from the plaintiff with effect from 1-
6-61 is wrong all the arbitrary, unauthorised and unreasonable and 
excessive and the plaintiff is entitled to the refund of this new charge paid 
by him to the defendant-Western Railway Administration. This also 
amounts to double taxation. In para 28 of the plaint, plaintiff actually 
refers to the total amount recovered in that manner. In the relief clause 
33 prayer made is to recover the suit amount which includes the amount 
it paid by way of new charges as said earlier, and the notice charges, 
and it is in terms stated that it is a claim for refund of new charger by 
way of siding charges, shunting charges, placement charges received by 
the defendant Western Railway Administration from the plaintiff. xxx

27. In the instant case, it is not the opponent’s case that charges in excess 
of the prescribed charges were recovered from him and he wants refund 
of such charges. What he claims is that the railway administration had 
collected such charges illegally, arbitrarily and unreasonably. These 
charges referred to as ‘new charges’ were levied by the railway 
administration from time to time and such collections made in the past 
are challenged on the aforesaid grounds. In my opinion, they cannot be 
termed ‘overcharges’, so as to attract the provisions of Section 78-B 
[...]”

In Birla Cement Works v. G.M. Westerm Railways & Anr. reported in 
(1995), this Court held that the excess freight charged by mistake due 
to a wrong calculation of distance was an overcharge and thus, was covered by 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

Section 78B of the 1890 Act (now Section 106 of the Act, 1989). The relevant 
observations read as under: - 
 
“2. The principal contention raised by the petitioner is that it had 
discovered the mistake when the railway authorities confirmed by their 
letter dated 12-10-1990 that they had committed a mistake in charging 
excess freight on wrong calculation of distance. The limitation starts 
running from the date of discovery of mistake and, therefore, stands 
excluded, by operation of Section 17(1)(c) of the Limitation Act, 1963 
(Act 21 of 1963) and that Section 78-B has no application to the facts in 
this case. In consequence, the High Court and the Tribunal have 
committed error of law in rejecting the claim for refund. We find no force 
in the contention. xxx 

xxx 

xxx 
 
4. [...] Section 78-B of the Act provides that a person shall not be entitled 
to refund of overcharge or excess payment in respect of animals or goods 
carried by Railway unless his claim to the refund has been preferred in 
writing by him or on his behalf to the Railway Administration to which 
the animals or goods were delivered to be carried by Railway etc. within 
six months from the date of the delivery of the animals or goods for 
carriage by Railway. The proviso has no application to the facts of this 
case. An overcharge is also a charge which would fall within the 
meaning of Section 78-B of the Act. Since the claims were admittedly 
made under Section 78-B itself but beyond six months, by operation of 
that provision in the section itself, the claim becomes barred by 
limitation. Therefore, the Tribunal and the High Court have rightly 
concluded that the petitioner is not entitled to the refund of the amount 
claimed.”

In Steel Authority of India Ltd. (supra), the goods were booked to be 
carried through a longer-route and the freight was accordingly charged for the 
long route. However, the goods instead were dispatched through the shorter 
route. The Orissa High Court held that overcharge is anything charged in excess 
of what is actually to be charged for a particular thing. The High Court observed 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

that as the goods had been booked for the longer route, the freight was also 
payable for the longer route. Since, no freight in excess of what was payable was 
realized, the High Court held that the claim for refund of the difference in freight 
charges was not one of overcharge. The relevant observations read as under: - 
 
“4. [...] the coal imported at Visakhapatnam Port for carriage to 
Rourkela Steel Plant was required to be booked and carried by the 
longer route covering 1082 kilometres instead of by the shorter route of 
667 kilometres. According to the plaintiff, in view of the rationalisation 
scheme and the general order, it had no choice but to pay freight for the 
longer route, as booking could not be for carriage over the shorter route. 
 
5. It is the further case of the plaintiff that in or about April, 1987, an 
officer came to know that some of the rakes booked were despatched to 
Rourkela by the shorter route (covering a distance of 667 kilometres) 
though weight charges were recovered for carriage by the longer 
rationalised route (covering a distance of 1082 kilometres). On further 
enquiry made at different junctions, it was gathered that during the 
period 15-4-1986 to 28-11-1986 and 5-1-1987 to 28-2-1987, a large 
quantity of imported coal booked from Visakhapatnam to Bondamunda 
had in fact been carried, not by the rationalised route but by the shorter 
route. On coming to know about the aforesaid fact, alleges the plaintiff, 
it lodged a demand for refund of the differential amount of Rs. 
1,32,87,749/-, but the same was turned down. [...]

13-A. The word “overcharge” has not been defined in the Act. Therefore, 
the common parlance meaning has to be taken to explain its meaning. In 
common parlance, the simple meaning of “overcharge” is anything 
charged in excess of what is actually to be charged for a particular thing. 
Taking this to be the meaning of “overcharge”, it has to be seen as to 
whether the claim of the respondent is or is not for refund of overcharge. 
Admittedly, the goods were booked for being carried over the 
rationalised route which covers a distance of 1082 kilometres. It is 
neither the respondent's case nor the appellants' case that what was 
charged towards freight was in excess of what was payable for the 
distance of 1082 kilometres. In other words, the respondent was not 
“overcharged” because no freight in excess of what was payable for 
1082 kilometres was realised. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

14. To appreciate the meaning of “overcharge”, as illustration from the 
facts of the present case would, I feel, be appropriate. Say for example, 
‘A’ had booked the coal for being carried by the shorter route covering 
a distance of 667 kilometres but freight was charged from him for the 
longer route covering a distance of 1082 kilometres. Here, since the coal 
was booked to be carried by the shorter route, freight ought to have been 
determined accordingly. So, any amount recovered from ‘A’ towards 
freight in excess of what was legally payable for the distance of 667 
kilometres would be an ‘overcharge’ because what was recovered from 
him was over and above what was actually payable for the distance of 
667 kilometres over which goods were booked. Alternatively, if ‘A’ had 
booked the goods over the longer route covering a distance of 1082 
kilometres and freight was charged for such distance but carriage was 
over the shorter route covering distance of 667 kilometres, in such a 
situation, if ‘A’, on coming to know that though he had booked the goods 
to be carried over the longer route and had paid the freight accordingly 
yet as the goods were carried over the shorter route, claims for a refund, 
this claim would not be one for “overcharge” for the simple reason that 
he had booked the goods by a particular route and paid the freight that 
was payable for that distance. The claim of the respondent in the present 
case is of a like nature. Thus, under no stretch of imagination can it be 
said that its claim is for refund of over-charge. The contention of the 
learned counsel for the appellants that the claim made by the respondent 
for refund of overcharge, therefore, must fail.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
51. 
In Rajasthan State Electricity Board v. Union of India reported in AIR 
2001 Bom 310, the freight was initially being charged on an inflated distance rate 
as fixed by the Central Government. Later the freight was fixed to be charged on 
the actual distance, however, the railway continued charging freight as per the 
old inflated distance under a mistaken belief that the same was still applicable. 
The High Court prima-facie was of the view that the refund of the difference in 
freight was an overcharge and thus barred by Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

However, the High Court relegated the petitioners therein to avail the statutory 
remedy and dismissed the writ petition leaving all issues open for determination 
by the Railway Claims Tribunal. The relevant observations read as under: - 
 
“2. The facts of the case, which are not in dispute, are:— Petitioners, 
Rajasthan State Electricity Board, are an autonomous public body, 
wholly owned and controlled by the State Government of Rajasthan. For 
the generation of electricity at their Thermal Power Station at Kota 
(Rajasthan), coal is transported from collieries situate in areas covered 
by the Eastern and South Eastern Railways to a station called Gurla, 
situate in Kota Division of the Western Railway. Between the 4th March, 
1992 and 31st December, 1992, the Petitioners booked 248 rakes for 
carrying coal to Gurla. The routes on which these wagons were 
transported include a section of Central Railway, viz., Katni-Singrauli. 
In exercise of powers under section 71 of the Railways Act, 1989, the 
Central Government had imposed, for movement of coal wagons over 
this section “inflated distance rate” of freight. Consequently, for the coal 
wagons moved by the petitioners, the freight included the inflated 
distance rate for this particular section of Katni-Singrauli. For the 
wagons booked by the petitioners, freight was paid at Gurla Station of 
Kota Division of the Western Railway. The Railway Authorities charged 
the petitioners freight on the basis of inflated distance rate over Katni-
Singrauli section upto 31st December, 1992, but from the 1st January, 
1993, the Railways started charging freight on the basis of actual 
distance for Katni-Singrauli section, instead of inflated distance rate, 
and the petitioners paid the charges on that basis. xxx 

xxx 

xxx 
 
9. It was submitted on behalf of the Petitioners that sub-section (3) of 
section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989 is not attracted in the facts of this 
case-inasmuch as there was no dispute regarding the over-charge. The 
instant case was a case of collection of inflated distance charge without 
authority of law. It was submitted that there is a distinction between 
over-charge and a wrong charge. It was, therefore, submitted that the 
Petitioners were not required to give notice as contemplated by sub-
section (3) of section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989, since the claim was 
not a claim for refund of an overcharge in respect of goods carried by 
railway. On the other hand, the respondents contend that this clearly a 
case where the Petitioners claim refund of an over-charge in respect of 
goods carried by railway, and, therefore, admittedly, the Petitioners 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

claim that they have been charged more than what they should have been 
charged because the circular under which inflated distance charge was 
levied had been withdrawn, and was not operative during the period in 
question. Despite this, the Petitioners were compelled to pay the inflated 
distance charge. 
 
10. In our view, the submission urged on behalf of the respondents must 
prevail, and the same is clearly supported by the principles laid down by 
the Apex Court in Birla Cement Works v. G.M., Western Railways, 
(1995): AIR 1995 SC 1111. The petitioner therein 
manufacturer of Cement at Chittorgarh in Rajasthan, had transported 
cement to various destinations through railway carriages. Prior to 3rd 
May, 1989, the Petitioner got the cement transported through meter 
gauge from the railway siding at Chanderia. After conversion into broad 
gauge the railway siding was at Difthkola Chittor Broad Gauge Rail 
Link. Consequently, 34 kilometres’ distance was added to levy freight 
charges. Thereafter, between May-June, 1989 and March, 1990 the 
Petitioner had booked various consignments of cement and transported 
them to diverse destinations and paid the freight charges. Later, on 
January 21, 1991, the Petitioner had sent a notice to the Western 
Railway under section 78-B of the Indian Railway Act, 1890, claiming 
refund of different amounts. Since it was rejected, the Petitioner laid a 
claim under section 16 of the Act before the Railway Claims Tribunal, 
which dismissed the petition holding the same to be barred under section 
78-B of the Indian Railway Act, 1890. xxx 

xxx 

xxx 
 
16. [...] Having regard to the scheme of the Act, we are satisfied that it 
provides a complete mechanism for correcting any error, whether of fact 
or law, and that not only a remedy is provided by way of claim before a 
Tribunal, but also a further appeal to this Court, which is a Civil Court. 
It would, therefore, not be appropriate for this Court, in exercise of its 
writ jurisdiction, to give relief, which authority, in law, has been vested 
in the Claims Tribunal under section 13 of the Railway Claims Tribunal 
Act, 1987. xxx 

xxx 

xxx 
 
18. We, therefore, find no merit in this Writ Petition, and the same is 
accordingly dismissed, and Rule discharged, but without prejudice to the 
right of the petitioners to seek remedy before the appropriate forum, if 
so advised.”

52. 
The aforesaid decision of the Bombay High Court came to be challenged 
before this Court. A 2-Judge Bench of this Court in Rajasthan State Electricity 
Board v. Union of India reported in (2008), set-aside the High 
Court’s order and held the appellant therein to be entitled to refund of the freight 
charges. The relevant observations read as under: - 
 
“4. In the present case between 4-3-1992 and 31-12-1992 the appellant 
had booked rakes for carrying coal to Gurla. A sum of Rs. 3,56,69,671 
which had been collected from the appellant over a period of time by 
mistake. That the mistake has been committed is admitted by the 
respondent herein and it is has duly been noted by the High Court. 
However, the High Court, in our view, erroneously rejected the claim on 
the ground of availability of alternative remedy. On the aforesaid 
premises the High Court dismissed the wirt petition with the direction to 
the appellant to approach the Railway Claims Tribunal for alternative 
remedy provided under Section 13 of the Railway Claims Tribunal Act, 
1987 (hereinafter “the Act”). 
 
5. We are clearly of the view that as the respondent Union of India has 
clearly admitted the liability, the High Court ought not to have relegated 
the appellant to its alternative remedy and should not have dismissed the 
writ petition on that count. There is no disputed question of fact in this 
case. As already noted, in the present case the respondent had admitted 
its liability and, therefore, the question raised before the High Court 
being an admitted fact the High Court ought not to have directed the 
appellant to resort to its alternative remedy under the Act. 
 
6. In the aforesaid premises, we set aside the impugned order of the High 
Court. This appeal is allowed. No costs. The respondents are directed to 
pay the admitted liability along with interest at the rate of 6% p.a. with 
effect from 6-1-1993 till payment is made within three months from 
today.”

In Union of India & Ors. v. West Coast Paper Mills Ltd. & Anr. reported 
in (2004), the prescribed rate that was being charged as per law by 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

the railways had been declared to be illegal. This Court held that any claim of 
refund of such charge which is illegal cannot be said to be an overcharge and thus 
does not attract Section 78B of the Act, 1890. This Court explained that an 
overcharge is something in excess of what is due according to law, an overcharge 
must be of the same genus or class as a charge, and it does not include a sum that 
was collected but was not due. The relevant observations read as under: - 
 
“19. The term overcharge is not defined in the Act. In its dictionary 
meaning "overcharge" means "a charge of a sum, more than is permitted 
by law" (see: Aiyar, P. Ramanatha: The Law Lexicon, 1997 Edn., p. 
1389). The term came up for the consideration of the High Court of 
Gujarat in Shah Raichand Amulakh v. Union of India. Chief Justice P.N. 
Bhagwati (as His Lordship then was) interpreted the term by holding 
that "overcharge" is not a term of art. It is an ordinary word of the 
English language which according to its plain natural sense means any 
charge in excess of that prescribed or permitted by law. To be an 
overcharge, a sum of money must partake of the same character as the 
charge itself or must be of the same genus or class as a charge; it cannot 
be any other kind of money such as money recovered where nothing is 
due. Overcharge is simply a charge in excess of that which is due 
according to law. 
 
20. In the case at hand, the freight rates notified by the Railway 
Administration in exercise of its statutory power to do so, so long as they 
were not declared illegal and unreasonable by the Tribunal under 
Section 41 of the Act, were legal and anyone carrying the goods by rail 
was liable to pay the freight in accordance with those rates. The freight 
paid by the respondents was as per the rates notified. Thus the present 
one is not a case of overcharge at all. It is a case of illegal recovery of 
freight on account of being unreasonable and in violation of Section 28 
of the Act, consequent upon such determination by the Tribunal and the 
decision of the Tribunal having been upheld by this Court. A case of 
"illegal charge" is distinguishable from the case of "overcharge" and 
does not attract the applicability of Section 78-B of the Railways Act.”

In J.K. Lakshmi Cement Ltd. v. General Manager & Anr. reported in 
(2014) SCC OnLine Raj 2340, the Rajasthan High Court held that the freight 
charged mistakenly on a wrong calculation of distance between the two stations 
was an overcharge and not an illegal charge. The High Court observed that an 
overcharge is an excess sum having the same character as the basic charge which 
otherwise is payable, and thus, any other kind of levy unrelated to the basic 
charge would not be an overcharge. Since the excess freight that was charged due 
to mistake on part of the railway booking staff related to ‘freight charges’ which 
otherwise was payable, the same was held to be an overcharge. The relevant 
observations read as under: - 
 
“[...] The facts of the case are that the appellant-Company dispatched 5 
racks of 4100 M.T. levy cement from its Banas siding to be carried and 
delivered at Thiyat Hamira Railway Station. The distance between two 
stations is stated to be only 511 Kms, and the Railways alleged to had 
charged freight for distance of 946 Kms. Calculating the distance via 
Rewari. It was stated that because of this mistake in the calculation of 
the distance from the appellant-Company’s Banas siding to Thiyat 
Hamira Railway Station, railway freight was charged in excess s. 
21.44 per qtl. Instead of the applicable rate of Rs. 13.11 per qtl. and paid 
under mistake. Consequently Rs. 3,69,775/- was overpaid. This excess 
realisation was according to the appellant-Company on the face of it 
arbitrary, unauthorized and illegal and thus refundable by the Railways 
with interest. xxx

[...] Further, a bare look at the judgement of the Hon’ble Gujarat High 
Court in Mansukhlal Jethalal (Supra) as also the judgement of the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court in West Coast Paper Mills Ltd. (Supra) makes it 
clear that an overcharge of freight would mean “a charge of sum more 
than permitted in law”. Overcharge of a sum of money for a purpose 
partakes the same character as the underlying charge and belongs to the 
same genus or class the basic charge. Any other kind of levy of money 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

unrelated to the basic charge would, as held by the Gujarat High Court 
and the Hon’ble Supreme Court, indeed would not take the character of 
an overcharge. In the Gujarat High Court case the overcharge related 
to a charge relating to the use of sidings of the Railways and it did not 
entail an excess charge on the freight as in the instant case. So to in the 
case before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In my considered opinion, from 
the very enunciation of law by the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in 
Mansukhlal Jethalal (Supra) and the Hon'ble Supreme Court in West 
Coast Paper Mills Ltd. (Supra) it is evident that the charge levied over 
the appellant-Company was qua the freight and movement of goods and 
nothing more excessive though it is alleged to be. It did not have a 
character different from the basic change. In fact the appellant-Company 
itself averred of realisation of an excess freight and specifically in para 
6 of the plaint had itself averred that due to mistake in calculating of 
distance excess freight was realised at the rate of Rs.21.44 per qtl. instead of Rs.13.11 per qtl.. Further in the notice under Section 78B of 
the Act of 1890 R/w Section 80 CPC issued by the appellant-Company 
prior to the filing of the suit for recovery of money before the District 
Judge, Sirohi, it was submitted that due to mistake on the part of the 
booking staff of the Railways incorrect distance was computed from 
Banas siding to Thiyat Hamira railway station against the correct 
chargeable distance of 511 KMs and the distance was worked out to 946 
KMs. which was the chargeable via Rewari. In para 4 of the suit it was 
stated that on the part of the Railway enhanced rate (emphasis mine) s.21.44 per qtl. was charged. In my considered opinion as also held by 
the learned Tribunal, the case set up by the appellant-Company makes it 
evidently clear that the refund was sought of the excess freight realized 
allegedly illegally and unauthorizedly. The excess freight without doubt 
related to freight otherwise payable for the movement / transportation of 
goods by the Railways and therefore was obviously an overcharge. 
Consequently, Section 78B of the Act of 1890 attracted to the claim 
petition filed. Admittedly notice with regard to the freight paid between 
07.12.1985 and 11.02.1986 was issued on 17.02.1988 quite clearly 
beyond the period of six months as statutorily mandated. The Tribunal 
was right in so holding.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
55. 
Furthermore, the contention that retainment of excess freight by the 
railway due to the claim applications being time-barred would amount to unjust 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

enrichment of the Railway came to be negatived by the Rajasthan High Court in 
J.K. Lakshmi Cement (supra). The High Court observed that equity cannot 
defeat the statutory provision and thus, if any excess freight realized by the 
railway is held to be an unjust enrichment it would result in the statutory time-
period under Section 78B of the Act, 1989 being rendered otiose and redundant. 
The relevant observations read as under: - 
 
“Mr. S.R. Joshi has finally submitted that in the event this Court were to 
uphold the impugned order dated 15.05.1990, passed by the Tribunal, it 
would entail unjust enrichment of the Railway as admittedly the distance 
over which its goods were transported was 511 KMs and not 946 KMs 
(between Banas siding and Thiyat Hamira railway station) and further 
that rate charged was Rs.21.44 per qtl. instead of Rs.13.11 per qtl. 
Limitation under Section 78B of the Act of 1989 has been statutorily 
provided for. A misplaced argument of unjust enrichment cannot be 
misapplied, removed from the context it has been developed by courts of 
equity and turned on its head and be agitated to circumvent the 
provisions of statutory limitation and for the matter, the Limitation Act. 
Were it to be so, the provisions of the law limitation under the Act of 
1963 or otherwise would be rendered otiose and redundant. Equity to 
defeat pubic policy encapsulated in the statutes of limitation cannot be 
visualised.”

In another decision of this Court in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation 
Ltd. v. Union of India, reported in (2018), the freight had been paid 
as per the notified chargeable distance. Subsequently when a computerized 
system for generating railway receipts was introduced, the chargeable distance 
was reduced and re-notified. This Court relying upon West Coast Paper Mills 
(supra) held that since the freight had been paid as per the notified rate which 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

was later found to be incorrect, the case would be of an illegal charge and not an 
overcharge. The relevant observations reads as under: - 
 
“2. The core facts that will be required to be noticed are as follows: the 
appellant, a public sector organisation, had dispatched various 
petroleum products through Railway Tank Wagons of the respondent 
from Asaudah Railway Station, District Rohtak, Haryana to Partapur, 
District Meerut, Uttar Pradesh and to some other destinations located in 
different parts of the country. The freight was paid by the appellant as 
per the notified distance i.e., 125 Km, so notified by the Chief Goods 
Supervisor, the competent authority at the relevant point of time. The 
dispatch of the petroleum products continued for a long period between 
the year 2008 and 2011 and the freight charges were paid according to 
the distance between the destinations as notified by the competent 
authority of the respondent. When the manual system of generating 
railway receipts was discontinued and the respondent had installed 
computerised railway freight charges system called Terminal 
mechanism System (TMS) at Asaudha Railway Station, the distance 
between Asaudah Railway Station, District Rohtak, Haryana and 
Partapur District Meerut (Uttar Pradesh was notified as 100 km instead 
of 125 km. This was on 27-2-2011. xxx 

xxx 

xxx 
 
8. Birla Cement Works was a case where the petitioner therein (i.e., Birla 
Cement Works) came to know of the alleged excess amount of freight on 
wrong calculation of distance through a letter dated 12-10-1990 issued 
by the Railway Authorities. This primary fact is conspicuously absent in 
the present case. In the present case what was paid was as per the fixed 
rate on the basis of notified distance which subsequently was corrected 
by another Notification upon introduction of the Terminal Mechanism 
System (TMS) at Asaudah Railway Station, District Rohtak, Haryana. 
 
9. On the other hand, in West Coast Paper Mills Ltd., this Court in para 
20 of the said Report took the view as the freight paid was as per the 
rates notified the case would not be one of overcharge at all/ If that is 
the view taken by this Court on an interpretation of the pari materia 
provision in erstwhile Act i.e., the Railway Act, 1890 (i.e., Section 78-B) 
we do not see why, in the facts of the present case which are largely 
identical, we should be taking any other view in the matter.”

In Union of India v. Mineral Enterprises reported in (2019) SCC OnLine 
Kar 1971, the Karnataka High Court was dealing with a matter where the actual 
distance between the two stations was less than what was charged by the 
railways. The Karnataka High Court in the said case held that the excess freight 
collected by the railways on a chargeable distance more than the prescribed 
distance was an overcharge within the meaning of Section 106 of the Act, 1989. 
The relevant observations read as under: - 
 
“3. [...] The facts briefly stated are that the respondent M/s Mineral 
Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., was transporting the minerals through the 
appellant railways from Ammasandra to Panamburu as per the rates 
fixed for transportation of the consignment. The distance from 
Ammasandra Railway Station to Panamburu was calculated as 365 Kms. and freight was charged as per the rate fixed by the railways. The freight 
charges were dependent on the distance between the place of loading 
and unloading of consignment. Later, on enquiry it was learnt that the 
actual distance between Ammasandra Railway Station to Panamburu 
post is only 359 Kms. and not 365 Kms. as charged by the appellant 
railways. Therefore, the respondent Company made correspondence 
with the railways through letters dated 3.10.2006, 5.5.2007 
and 20.07.2007 requesting to take corrective action. [...] 
 
xxx 

xxx 

xxx 
 
14. It is and admitted fact that the respondent Company had transported 
the irone ore fines / minerals through the railways for the period from 
25.05.2006 to 04.01.2007 at the rates fixed by the railway. The main 
controversy was in respect of refund of excess freight charges said to 
have been collected by the railways than the prescribed rates fixed on 
the basis of distance. In that connection the respondent Company had 
sought for clarification about the actual distance for which the appellant 
railways gave the reply. As could be seen from the records the actual 
distance between Ammasandra to Panamburu is 358 kms., whereas the 
railways had calculated the distance as 365 kms., but they have collected 
the rates applicable for the distance above 360 Kms. It is an admitted 
fact that after clarification regarding actual distance, the railways had 
settled some of the claims of the respondent Company regarding excess 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

charges which were within the limitation period. Some of the claims to 
an extent of Rs.8,85,000/- were rejected on the reason that they were 
barred by limitation. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to 
ascertain whether the repudiation of claims regarding Rs.8,85,000/- was 
justified. xxx

23. The learned counsel for the appellant railways has relied on a 
decision in the case of Birla Cement Works vs. G M, Western Railways 
and another reported in (1995), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court has held under: 
"Railways - Railways Act, 1890 - S.78.B - Railway Claims Tribunal 
Act, 1987 - S 16 - Limitation - Computation of - Claim to refund of 
excess freight notified under S.78- B beyond the statutory time-limit 
on discovering the mistake from railway authorities' letter - Rightly 
held by the Tribunal and the High Court to be time- barred - Further 
held, provision in. 
 
XXX 
4. Section 78-B of the Act provides that a person shall not be entitled 
to refund of overcharge or excess payment in respect of animal or 
goods carried by Railway unless his claim to the refund has been 
preferred in writing by him or on his behalf to the Railway 
Administration to which the animals or goods were delivered to be 
carried by Railway etc. within six months from the date of the 
delivery of the animals or goods for carriage by railway the proviso 
has no application to the fact of this case. An overcharge is also a 
charge which would fall within the meaning of Section 78-B of the 
Act. Since the claims were admittedly made under Section 78-B itself 
but beyond six months, by operation of that provision in the section 
itself, the claim becomes barred by limitation. Therefore, the 
Tribunal and the High Court have rightly concluded that the 
petitioner is not entitled to the refund of the amount claimed. " 
 
24. In the aforesaid case the principal contention raised by the petitioner 
was that the claimant had discovered the mistake when the railway 
authorities confirmed by their letter that they had committed a mistake 
in charging excess freight on wrong calculation of distance. As such, the 
limitation starts running from the date of discovery of mistake and 
therefore stands excluded by the operation of Section 17(i)(c) of 
Limitation Act and that Section 78(B) has no application to the facts in 
this case. But it was held that Section 17(i)(c) of Limitation Act, 1963, 
would apply only to a suit instituted or an application made in that behalf 
in the civil suit but whereas the Tribunal is the creature of statute, 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

therefore it is not a civil court nor the limitation act has application, even 
though it may be held that the petitioner discovered the mistake 
committed in paying the over charges, the limitation is not saved by 
operation of Section 17(i) (c) of the Limitation Act. 
 
25. The facts of the case on hand are exactly similar to that of the facts 
involved in the aforesaid decision. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the 
said situation has held that the claims made under Section 78(B) are 
barred by limitation. As such, they cannot be entertained. The aforesaid 
decision was not at all referred or considered in the decisions relied on 
by the counsel for the claimant - respondent. The doctrine of binding 
precedent is of utmost importance in the administration of judicial 
system. It brings certainty and consistency in judicial decisions. The 
judicial consistency promotes confidence in the system. The ratio laid 
down in the aforesaid decision ((1995) ) is aptly applicable to 
the facts of this case. As such, the claims which are barred by limitation 
in view of Section 106 of the Railways Act (78(B) of the Old Act) cannot 
be entertained.”

In yet another decision of the Orissa High Court in M/s National 
Aluminium Co. Ltd. v. Union of India FAO No. 306 of 2022, the goods were 
booked to be carried by a longer-route and freight was accordingly charged for 
the long route. However, the goods instead were dispatched by the shorter route. 
The High Court placing reliance on Steel Authority of India Ltd. (supra) which 
involved similar facts, held that since what was charged was prescribed by law, 
the refund was not for an overcharge, and Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 would 
not be attracted. The relevant observations read as under: - 
 
“8. Mrs. Rath contends that the Tribunal has misconceived the claim for 
refund of additional freight charges received by the railways with the 
term ‘overcharges’ and in this regard she relies on a decision of this 
Court reported in AIR 1997 Orissa 77 (Union of India and others vrs. 
Steel Authority of India Limited). 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

9. The above referred case is involving similar issues where SAIL filed a 
suit before the Sub-Judge, Rourkela praying for refund of excessive 
charges received by the railways under the rationalization scheme 
relating to the old Act, i.e. Indian Railways Act, 1890. Section 78-B of 
the old Act is same to the present Section 106 in the Railways Act, 1989. 
This Court while deciding with the issue that, whether the claim for 
refund of overcharge is maintainable for want of notice under Section 
78-B, have held that the claim is not one for ‘overcharge’ for the simple 
reason that the goods were booked by a particular route and paid the 
freight that was payable for that distance. [...] 
 
10. In view of the above, no second opinion can be there to treat the claim 
of refund of additional freight charges beyond ‘overcharges’ and no 
prior notice under Section 106 of the Railways Act is required to be sent. 
Undisputedly, no such notice has been sent by NALCO as per the 
submissions made by Mrs. Rath in course of hearing and the admitted 
fact remains that several intimations seeking refund of such amount from 
the railways have been sent by NALCO in those letters annexed to the 
claim application, as seen from the copy of the claim application 
produced in course of hearing. So, no further discussions on the facts of 
the present case is needed here on the requirement of notice under 
Section 106.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
59. 
What can be discerned from the above is that this Court as-well as various 
High Courts have consistently held that the rigours of Section 106(3) of the Act, 
1989 will only be applicable where the claim is for a refund of an ‘overcharge’. 
Where the claim for refund is for anything but an ‘overcharge’, Section 106(3) of 
the Act, 1989 will not apply, and no notice of claim is required. b. 
Concept of an ‘Overcharge’ and an ‘Illegal Charge’ 
 
60. 
As to what would be an ‘overcharge’, this Court and the various High 
Courts have consistently held that an ‘overcharge’ is any sum charged in excess 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

or more than what was payable as per law. Whereas an illegal charge is any sum 
which is impermissible in law. 
 
61. 
Since the underlying difference in the dictionary meaning of both the 
expressions; “overcharge” and “illegal charge” is that of the prefix “over” and 
“illegal”, used in conjunction with the word “charge”, it would be apposite to first 
understand the meaning of the term “charge”. 

“CHARGE” 
 
P Ramanatha Aiyar’s ‘The Law Lexicon’ (Vol I, 6th Edn., 2019 at pg. 886) 
defines “Charge” as: - 
 
“it is the price required or demanded for services 
rendered.” 

(Emphasis supplied) 
 
L.P. Singh and P.K. Majumdar’s ‘Judicial Dictionary’ (2nd Edn., 2005 at 
pg. 460) defines “charge” as under: - 
 
“any sum fixed by law for services of public officers or for 
use of a privilege under control of government” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Henry Campbell Black in ‘Black’s Law Dictionary’ (4th Edn., 1968 at pg. 
295) defines “Chargeable” as: - 
 
“something capable or liable to be charged”. 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

“OVER” 
 
The term “over” as a prefix has been defined by L.P. Singh and P.K. 
Majumdar’s ‘Judicial Dictionary’ (2nd Edn., 2005 at pg. 996) as under: - 
 
“excessive or beyond a an agreed or desirable limit”. 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 

P Ramanatha Aiyar’s ‘The Law Lexicon’ (Vol III, 6th Edn., 2019 at pg. 
3990) states that “Over” as a prefix denotes something: - 
 
“something excessive or excessively” 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Henry Campbell Black on ‘Black’s Law Dictionary’ (4th Edn., 1968 at pg. 
1256) defines it as something: - 
 
“more than or in excess of” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 

“ILLEGAL” 
Whereas the term “illegal” is defined by Henry Campbell Black in ‘Black’s 
Law Dictionary’ (4th Edn., 1968 at pg. 882) as something: - 
 
“not authorized by law or contrary to law or unlawful” or 
“something which lacks authority of or support from law” 
 
 (Emphasis supplied) 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

P Ramanatha Aiyar’s ‘The Law Lexicon’ (Vol II, 6th Edn., 2019 at pg. 
2605) defines it as: - 
 
“something that is against the law” or “something which is 
contrary to or forbidden by law” 
(Emphasis supplied) 

L.P. Singh and P.K. Majumdar’s ‘Judicial Dictionary’ (2nd Edn., 2005 at 
pg. 749) defines it as: - 
 
“something which is prohibited by law” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
62. 
Thus, in its plain meaning, the use of words “capable” and “imposed by 
law” shows that the term “charge” means something which in the eyes of law is 
permissible and payable, and therefore the term “overcharge” which is a 
conjunction of “over” and “charge” would mean something more than or beyond 
what is payable in the eyes of law. Same way, an “illegal charge” would mean a 
charge which is contrary to the law or lacks the authority of law or simplicter is 
unlawful. 
 
63. 
L.P. Singh and P.K. Majumdar’s ‘Judicial Dictionary’ (2nd Edn., 2005 at 
pg. 888) defines ‘over-charge’ in the context of Section 106 of the Act, 1989 as 
follows: – 
 
“The expressions “charge” and “over charge” are properly employed 
only with reference to actual quantum of liability, and they cannot be 
applied to relate to rates of charges. There will be an over charge if 
Railway applies higher rate than appropriate and there can also be an 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

over charge where even at a rate which itself is not open to objection, 
there is yet an excessive liability foisted by the railway. It is not possible 
to restrict the expression over charge only to former kind of cases where 
the railway applies a higher rate than that which the law allows.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 

64. 
Thus, in the context of Section 106 sub-section (3) of the Act, 1989, an 
“overcharge” would be any sum which has been paid in excess or over and above 
or more than what was payable by law / required by law. It pertains to only the 
actual quantum of liability. Furthermore, merely, because an incorrect or rather 
higher slab-rate has been applied, will not make it an illegal charge, as long as the 
charge was not itself open to objection i.e., not incorrect. 
 
65. 
It is pertinent to note, that the term “payable by law” should not be 
conflated with the term “permissible by law”, this is because although something 
maybe paid in excess than what was required by law, yet the same would by no 
means automatically become an “overcharge”. This is further fortified from the 
fact that, “charge” as above-stated is defined to mean something which is either 
required OR demanded to be paid. 
 
66. 
For illustration; say ‘A’ booked certain goods to be carried by railway, and 
the railway charged ‘A’ loading charges for the goods, even-though, there was no 
loading of goods involved. Here, although the law allows railway to levy loading 
charges i.e., the loading charges are permissible by law, and even-though the sum 
paid by ‘A’ towards loading charges can be said to be in excess of what was 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

required (i.e., in excess of Nil loading charges as no loading was involved), this 
would not be an “overcharge” but would be an “illegal charge”. 
 
67. 
We say so because, the very basic charge or in other words the genus or 
basis of the charge i.e., the loading charge in itself was not required to be paid. 
Thus, when the very basis or genus of the charge was not payable as per law then 
any sum which is collected in respect of the same will not be an overcharge but 
would be an illegal charge. Since the very class of the charge was not required to 
be payable by law. 
 
68. 
Conversely, say for example, ‘A’ again booked certain goods to be carried 
by railway, and the railway charged ‘A’ loading charges for the goods, and this 
time loading of goods was involved in the consignment, but the railway 
mistakenly charged ‘A’ Rs. 100/- more towards the loading charges than what 
was required by the rate applicable. Here the basis or genus of this excess charge 
of Rs. 100/- i.e., the loading charges itself was payable by law. Any sum charged 
in excess of the loading charges as required by law would be an ‘overcharge’. 
 
69. 
For another illustration, say ‘A’ booked the carriage of iron ore by the 
railway, however, instead of being charged for the rate applicable for iron, the 
railway by mistake charged ‘A’ for steel. Now the rate which is applicable for 
steel is permissible by law, but here since iron was being carried, the rate 
applicable for steel though permissible by law is not payable by law, as the 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

consignment was not for steel. Thus, any sum paid although is in excess of what 
was required, and the charge towards which it was paid was also permissible by 
law, the sum cannot be said to have been paid in excess of what was payable by 
law. 
 
70. 
Thus, for an excess sum to be an “overcharge” the sum paid must partake 
the same character as the basic charge, or must belong to the same genus of charge 
which was payable or required to be paid by law. Whereas, for an illegal charge, 
the sum must not have been payable by law. 
 
71. 
Another very fine but pertinent distinction between an ‘overcharge’ and an 
‘illegal charge’ is that, an ‘overcharge’ is generally inter-se the specific parties 
involved and in its peculiar facts. Whereas an ‘illegal charge’ is illegal for 
everyone irrespective of the parties or facts. 
 
72. 
For illustration, say ‘A’ booked 10 boxes to be carried by railway, however, 
he was erroneously charged for 12 boxes. Here the excess amount that has been 
charged for 12 boxes instead of 10 is an overcharge qua these specific facts for 
‘A’ alone. If ‘B’ books 12 boxes to be carried by railway, the said charge which 
was an overcharge qua ‘A’ will not be an overcharge qua ‘B’. For that matter 
even if ‘A’ in a different consignment books 12 boxes and is charged for 12 boxes, 
it will not constitute an overcharge. This will not be an illegal charge because, it 
is not illegal for Railway to levy charge for 12 boxes ipso-facto (whenever a 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

consignment is booked for 12 boxes, the Railway can levy that charge), but rather 
it is erroneous to levy charge for 12 boxes when in fact only 10 boxes were 
carried. Here whether the sum charged is an overcharge or not is largely 
dependent upon the peculiar facts, more particularly the number of boxes being 
booked for carriage. Thus, it can be safely said, that in case of an overcharge, the 
issue lies in the “charging” whereas in case of an illegal charge, the issue lies in 
the “charge” itself. 

73. 
Conversely for example, say for a particular route, the chargeable distance 
as per the law was 100 km, but the railways incorrectly showed the chargeable 
distance as 120 km in its local rate list. Now ‘A’ books a consignment of iron ore 
and ‘B’ books a consignment of steel, over the same 120 km distance. Irrespective 
of the type of goods or the quantity of goods being carried or by whom the 
consignment has been booked, any amount charged in respect of this incorrect 
chargeable distance of 120 km is an illegal charge. Here the sum charged as an 
illegal charge is not dependent upon either the peculiar facts or the parties thereof, 
the charge is illegal solely because the very charge itself i.e., the chargeable 
distance of 120 km was in contravention of the law. 
 
74. 
An Overcharge is effectively concerned with the error in the quantum of 
what was or should be payable, whereas an illegal charge is solely concerned with 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

whether a particular thing was payable by the law / in conformity with the law or 
not. 
 
75. 
Another aspect that distinguishes the two is that, an ‘overcharge’ often 
stems due to a clerical mistake or mis-interpretation or misapplication of law in a 
particular case, whereas an ‘illegal charge’ stems from a patent error or inherent 
error in the charge i.e., in contravention of the law and principles of fair play. In 
other words, in overcharge, the mistake is in the levying of the charge, whereas 
in illegal charge the error lies in the very substance of the charge itself which is 
in contravention of the law, even though the charge per-se is permissible by law. 
 
76. 
In West Coast Paper Mills (supra), the concerned railway zone therein was 
charging freight at a flat rate without giving any telescopic benefits to the 
consignees, which the other railway zones were providing. This denial of 
telescopic benefit was found to be unreasonable, arbitrary and against fair-play. 
Thus, the same was held to be illegal by this Court even-though the said charge 
was payable as per the notified rate. 
 
77. 
To illustrate, say the chargeable distance as measured by the concerned 
Zonal Railway Authority for a particular route is 100 km. However, the Station 
Master whilst making the local distance table records the said distance as 110 km 
due to a clerical mistake. Thus, because of an error in indicating the actual 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

chargeable distance in the table, the freight for the said route becomes chargeable 
for 110 km. Although the mistake here is a clerical one, yet because of such 
mistake, an inherent error has crept into the local distance table. Thus, the notified 
rate would be an illegal charge and not an overcharge. This is because the error 
here lies in the very substance or genesis of the charge that was notified i.e., the 
charge which is sanctioned and permitted to be levied by the law, but in 
contravention of the law i.e., in contravention of the Zonal Authority’s 
calculation. 
 
78. 
We are conscious of the fact that this Court in Rajasthan State Electricity 
Board (supra) had directed the refund of excess freight charged by misapplication 
of the law despite the claim being time-barred under Section 106(3), however, a 
closer reading would reveal that the refund had been directed in view of the 
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case. Even otherwise, the court in the said 
decision whilst directing the refund completely missed to advert to either the bar 
under Section 106(3) or whether the excess freight would be an ‘overcharge’. 
Nevertheless, the distinction between an ‘overcharge’ and an ‘illegal charge’ has 
been acknowledged by this Court in its subsequent decisions in West Coast Paper 
Mills (supra) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (supra), thus, we need not 
dwell any further on the decision of Rajasthan State Electricity Board (supra). 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

79. 
Further, a sum paid in excess of what was required to be payable as per 
law, must assume the character of an ‘overcharge’ on the date when the payment 
was made or when the charge was levied. To explain this in detail we may refer 
to the decision of the Calcutta High Court in Suresh Kumar v. Board of Trustees 
for the Port of Calcutta reported in (1988) SCC OnLine Cal 420. 
 
79.1 In the said decision, the issue pertained to the provision of Section 55 of 
the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963 (for short, the “Ports Act”), which is analogous 
to Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989, inasmuch as both the provisions provide that 
for a claim of refund of an ‘overcharge’ a notice of claim must be made within 6-
months from the date of payment. 
 
79.2 The facts of Suresh Kumar (supra) were as follows: there was a delay in 
custom clearance, because of which the goods had to be warehoused at the port. 
Due to this, the goods incurred heavy demurrage charges. The petitioner therein 
requested the custom authorities that since the delay was to no fault of its own, 
he may be issued an exemption certificate for the said demurrages. During this 
period, since the goods continued incurring demurrage charges, the petitioner 
therein paid the same under protest. Subsequent to the payment of the said 
charges, he was issued exemption certificates, whereby a portion of the 
demurrage charges stood abated. Accordingly, a claim for refund was made, 
however the same inter-alia came to be rejected in view of being time-barred as 
per Section 55 of the Ports Act. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

79.3 The Calcutta High Court observed that, although this was in essence a 
refund for an overcharge, as by virtue of the exemption certificates, a sum excess 
than what was required by law had been paid, yet, it would not be hit by Section 
55 of the Ports Act, as the excess sum only assumed a character of an overcharge, 
subsequent to the date of payment, when the exemption certificates were issued. 
The High Court held that the time-period under Section 55 of the Ports Act would 
only apply to a case where payment and overcharging would synchronize i.e., on 
the facts and circumstances as prevailing on the date of payment, the sum should 
be an overcharge. The relevant observations read as under: - 
“5. Because of the inordinate delay [in] the release of the said goods 
after completing all Customs formalities, the said goods suffered heavy 
demurrage charges. Accordingly the petitioner represented before the 
Customs authorities for allowing warehousing of the said goods, 
pending completion of the Customs formalities [...] 
 
7. Due to the aforesaid delay in allowing clearance of the said goods by 
the Customs authorities, the said goods incurred heavy demurrage due 
to no fault of the petitioner. In the circumstances, the petitioner prayed 
before the Customs authorities for issuance of necessary wharf rent 
exemption certificate in order to enable the petitioner to clear the 
consignment without payment of demurrages from the Port authorities. 
After several reminders on or about March 25, 1985 the Customs 
authorities handed over a wharf rent exemption certificate dated March 
23, 1985 to the petitioner covering part of the period of detention, that is 
from November 28, 1984 to March 1, 1985 in respect of consignment 
arrived per Vessel “Batara Dua” and from January 22, 1985 to March 
1, 1985 in respect of the consignments arrived per vessel “Vishwa 
Yash”. 
 
8. Thereupon the petitioner again requested the Customs authorities for 
issuance of wharf rent exemption certificate for the entire period of 
detention, that is, upto March 25, 1985. Meanwhile, however, as the 
goods were continuing to incur demurrage, the petitioner had no other 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

alternative but to make payment of the demurrage charges to the Port 
authorities under protest and take clearance of the said goods. In respect 
of the said consignments, the petitioner paid a total sum of Rs. 8,43,995 
as purported demurrage charges for the period November 28, 1984 to 
March 25, 1985 in respect of vessel “Batara Dua” and for the period 
January 15, 1985 to March 25, 1985 in respect of vessel “Vishwa Yash”. 
 
9. Thereafter, on or about February 3, 1986 the Customs authorities 
issued another wharf rent exemption certificate for the uncovered period 
from March 2, 1985 to March 25, 1985 in respect of the said goods. 
 
10. In the premises, by a letter dated 15th February, 1986, the petitioner 
filed an application before the Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts 
Officer, Post and Railway Audit Section, Calcutta Port Trust enclosing 
therewith the bills issued by the Port Trust authorities levying and 
realising demurrage charges as also the said wharf rent exemption 
certificates. By the said application the petitioner claimed refund for the 
sum of Rs. 8,43,995 paid by him under protest as aforesaid as purported 
demurrage/wharf rent charges. The petitioner drew the attention of the 
said Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer to the fact that in view 
of the said Wharf Rent Exemption Certificate the petitioner was 
not/could not be made, liable for payment of the said demurrage/wharf 
rent charges. 
 
11. In or about March 1986 the petitioner's representative received a 
purported communication dated 22nd February, 1986 issued by the 
Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer whereby the petitioner 
was informed that “no refund was due” to the petitioner as all claims 
were “time-barred as per Section 55 of the Major Port Trusts Act, 
1963”. 
 
14. It is also contended that the petitioner could have and should have 
submitted the refund claim within the time limit prescribed under Section 
55 of the Major Port Trust Act, 1963 but the claim for refund was 
submitted by the petitioner on 26th March, 1985 and 27th March, 1985. 
The claim for refund of the petitioner is statutorily time-barred. 
 
15. The contention is that while taking delivery of the said consignments 
the petitioner paid the port charges, that is to say, wharf rent and 
demurrage and did not produce any certificate from the Customs 
authority covering the period between the 2nd March, 1985 and 25th 
March, 1985 to the concerned shed of the Calcutta Port in order to 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

enable himself to obtain the concession on any rent charges in 
accordance with the scale of rates. The port rent and demurrage were 
paid in full and the wharfage exemption certificate was produced 
subsequently for refund. The payment made to the Port Trust while 
taking delivery of the cargo from its custody was an overcharge for 
which a claim should have been preferred within the time prescribed in 
Section 55 of the said Act. 
 
16. The first question which calls for determination is whether Section 
55 of the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963 has any application on the facts 
and in the circumstances of this case. Section 55 provides as follows: 
“No person shall be entitled to a refund of an overcharge made 
by a Board unless his claim to the refund has been preferred in 
writing by him or on his behalf to the Board within six months 
from the date of payment duly supported by all relevant 
documents. Provided that a Board may of its own motion remit 
overcharges made in its bills at any time.” 
 
17. It is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that in the 
instant case there is or can be no “overcharges” being made by the Port 
Trust Authorities. In the absence of Wharf Rent Exemption Certificate, 
the Port Trust Authorities had sought to realise Wharf Rent payable in 
respect of the subject goods. In view of the said Wharf Rent Exemption 
Certificate no wharf rent is payable by the petitioner and/or realisable 
by Port Trust Authorities from the petitioner. Thus the entire realisation 
of wharf rent in respect of the said goods is without authority of law as 
the said amount is not payable by the petitioner at all. Seeking of refund 
of such money cannot come within the purview of Section 55 of the said 
Act. 
 
18. This contention has substance. Section 55 will only apply to a case 
where payment and overcharging would synchronise: In other words, 
on the facts and in the cirumstances prevailing at the date of payment, 
Board should have overcharged the rent. In this case, on the date 
payment was made by the petitioner, the payment did not and could not 
assume the character of overcharging. It only assumed such character 
when the second set of exemption certificates had been issued on 3rd 
February, 1986.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

80. 
Section 106 of the Act, 1989, sub-section (3) specifically uses the words 
“paid” and “date of payment”. This clearly fortifies the above observations, that 
for a sum to be an “overcharge” within the meaning of Section 106(3) of the Act, 
1989, it must be an overcharge on the date when such sum was paid. If on the 
date when the payment was made, the sum in question was not an overcharge, it 
will not become an ‘overcharge” due to intervention of subsequent events at-least 
in terms of Section 106 of the Act, 1989. 
 
81. 
Otherwise, the same would lead to a very chilling effect, whereby a 
particular sum which at the time of payment was not an overcharge but due to 
subsequent events (not attributable to any mistake or lack of diligence) happens 
to become an overcharge after the lapse of the statutory time-period under Section 
106(3) of the Act, 1989 i.e., 6-months after the date of payment, even then the 
said sum would not be refundable because no notice was made within 6-months. 
Thus, the claim for refund of an “overcharge” in such case would become time-
barred owing to an impossibility i.e., making the notice within the time-period 
which could not have been made, as at the relevant point of time it was not an 
overcharge. 
 
82. 
It is a settled law that in interpreting a statute or a rule, the court must bear 
in mind that the legislature does not intend what is unreasonable or impossible. If 
a rule leads to an absurdity or manifest injustice from any adherence to it, the 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

court can step in. A statute or a rule ordinarily should be most agreeable to 
convenience, reason and as far as possible to do justice to all. A law/rule should 
be beneficial in the sense that it should suppress the mischief and advance the 
remedy. In interpreting a rule, it is legitimate to take into consideration the 
reasonableness or unreasonableness of any provision. Gross absurdity must 
always be avoided in a statute/rule. The expression reasonable means rational, 
according to the dictate of reason and not excessive or immoderate. 
 
83. 
Thus, keeping in mind the aforesaid view, and the specific language used 
in Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 particularly the words “paid” and “date of 
payment”, the aspects of “payment” and “overcharging” must synchronize in 
order to fall within the rigours of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989. 
 
84. 
This aforesaid aspect may be looked at from one another angle, by making 
use of the Hohfeld’s analysis of jural relations. As per Hohfeld’s scheme of jural 
relations conferring of a right on one entity must entail vesting of a corresponding 
duty in another. Under Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989, the right of consignee to 
seek a refund of an overcharge arises only when there is a corresponding duty on 
the railway administration to grant such refund i.e., when the notice of claim is 
made to it within the statutory period. To seek a refund, certain condition 
precedents need to be satisfied by the consignee before the right can be said to 
accrue, namely: - 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

a) An overcharge has been paid by the consignor to the Railway administration 
b) A notice has been served by the consignor to the Railway administration to 
which overcharge has been paid 
c) The consignor has served the said notice within six months from the date of 
such payment or the date of delivery of such goods at the destination station, 
whichever is later. 
 
84.1 Thus, once the aforesaid conditions are satisfied, the consignee’s “right to 
get a refund” can be said to have as its jural correlative the “duty to grant refund” 
of the Railway administration. 
 
85. 
Now the consignee’s duty to make the notice of claim for refund will only 
arise if the sum was an overcharge within the statutory time-period, if it is not, 
then it could not be said that there was any duty to make the notice of claim. 
Similarly, if the right of consignee to claim a refund for an overcharge, accrues 
when the sum was an overcharge on the date of payment, the corresponding duty 
of consignor to refund it will also arise when the sum was an overcharge. 
 
86. 
Thus, if on the date of payment, the sum was not an overcharge, neither is 
the right to claim refund emanating in terms of Section 106(3) nor is the 
corresponding duty i.e., neither the right nor the duty could be said to have arisen 
on the date of payment. Both the right to claim refund and the corresponding duty 
to refund must arise in synergy in terms of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

(emphasis). It would be too much to say that, although no overcharge was made 
in terms of Section 106(3), yet when the sum actually became an overcharge, the 
duty to seek refund will only be in terms of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989. 
 
87. 
For illustration, say, goods were booked and freight was charged at the rate 
of Rs. 100 per km, and accordingly freight was paid. Subsequently, 7-months 
later the Railways decides as a matter of policy to reduce it to Rs 50 per km with 
retrospective effect. Now though the reduction is taking place retrospectively, but 
intimated 7-months after when the payment was made, and further even-though, 
this is an overcharge (because Rs. 50 has been paid in excess of what was 
payable), it would not mean that in order to seek refund of the excess sum, the 
notice ought to have been made within 6-months as per Section 106(3) of the Act, 
1989, when the payment was made. Such a case, although of an overcharge, 
cannot be said to be one of “overcharge” within the meaning of Section 106(3) of 
the Act, 1989, thus no notice of claim would be required in such cases. 
 
88. 
Another peculiar aspect which must be borne in mind, is that the 
subsequent event which makes a particular charge an overcharge, must take place 
subsequent to the date of payment. For illustration, say freight on goods carried 
was charged by mistake at Rs. 100 instead of Rs. 50. Now this aspect comes to 
the knowledge of the parties 6-months after the date of payment. This would not 
mean that at the time when freight was being paid it was not an overcharge, as 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

the excess sum was realized due to a mistake committed on the date of payment 
irrespective of subsequent knowledge. It cannot be said that due to a bona-fide 
mistake neither party was under the impression that this is an overcharge. This is 
reinforced from the decision of this Court in Birla Cement Works (supra). Thus, 
whilst deciding the applicability of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 what has to 
be seen is whether the very sum that was levied was an overcharge or not on the 
date of payment. Mere lack of knowledge will not postpone the accrual of cause 
of action to apply under Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989. 
 
89. 
This distinction drawn between a claim for refund of an ‘overcharge’ and 
an ‘illegal charge’ is not imaginary or superfluous, but is well-founded from the 
landmark decision of a 9-Judge Bench of this Court in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. 
& Ors. v. Union of India reported in (1997), wherein this Court 
observed that a claim of refund for any excise or custom duty levied will broadly 
fall into three categories, and the relevant observations read as under: - 
 
“290. Broadly, the basis for the various refund claims can be classified 
into 3 groups or categories: - 
 
(I) The levy is unconstitutional — outside the provisions of the Act 
or not contemplated by the Act. 
 
(II) The levy is based on misconstruction or wrong or erroneous 
interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act, Rules or 
Notifications; or by failure to follow the vital or fundamental 
provisions of the Act or by acting in violation of the fundamental 
principles of judicial procedure. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

(III) Mistake of law — the levy or imposition was unconstitutional 
or illegal or not exigible in law (without jurisdiction) and, so found 
in a proceeding initiated not by the particular assessee, but in a 
proceeding initiated by some other assessee either by the High 
Court or the Supreme Court, and as soon as the assessee came to 
know of the judgment (within the period of limitation), he initiated 
action for refund of the tax paid by him, due to mistake of law.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
90. 
We see no reason as to why the above-mentioned distinction and categories 
should only be restricted to claims for refund pertaining to excise and custom 
levied and not extend to refund of charges levied by the Railway as-well. Thus, 
applying the aforesaid dictum, the three-categories can broadly be stated to be as 
follows: - 

Category 1 – “Illegal Charge” that is a levy which is outside or beyond 
the law. It is a charge which though may be notified in law as a lawful 
charge but at its core is stricto-sensu in contravention of the law, as 
explained by us in the preceding paragraphs of this judgement. 

Category 2 – “Overcharge” that is a levy based on misconstruction or 
misinterpretation or failure to follow the fundamental provisions / 
principle. It is a charge that is in excess of beyond what was required by 
the law i.e., by the notified or applicable charge, as illustrated in the 
preceding paragraphs of our discussion. 

Category 3 – “Nullified Charge” a levy which has been declared or 
struck-down as unconstitutional or illegal by a court on principles of 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

arbitrariness, unreasonableness or fair-play. This too would be in the nature 
of an “Illegal Charge” enunciated in Category 1 with the only difference 
being that, the courts found the law to be untenable in the eyes of law even 
though it may not be in contravention of the statutory provisions. Such as 
the charge levied by the arbitrary denial of telescopic benefits which was 
held to be illegal in West Coast Paper Mills (supra). 
 
91. 
Another reason, as to why this distinction assumes importance is in view 
of the intention behind the rigours of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989. The purpose 
behind incorporating the stricter and shorter time-period envisaged under Section 
106(3) of the Act, 1989 for refund of an overcharge is in view of its nature. 
 
92. 
An ‘overcharge’ as discussed by us above emanates due to a clerical or 
arithmetical mistake or misapplication of the law or charge prescribed or notified 
by the law, qua the peculiar facts of an individual case. Such mistakes are easily 
discoverable by exercising due-diligence; thus, a 6-month time period is 
stipulated to ensure that claimants are vigilant and prompt in bringing such errors 
to the notice of the railway. Due to the fact specific nature of such claims by way 
of errors at the very grass-root level, timely enquiries by railway to ascertain the 
mistake becomes a necessity. Thus, the intention of Section 106(3) of the Act, 
1989 is to ensure that when the claim is made, a timely enquiry into such factual 
errors is possible AND to bring quietus to stale and false claims of refunds made 
belatedly due to the laches & lack of vigilance on part of the claimant. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

93. 
The true purport of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 is by no stretch to 
render even those claims of refunds as time-barred which despite the best of 
efforts and diligence could not have been discovered by the claimants on their 
own accord. ‘Illegal Charges’ are by their nature prescribed, sanctioned and 
notified by law as a lawful levy even-though they may be inherently wrong or in 
contravention of the law. Thus, despite the exercise of a reasonable degree of 
diligence, there could be no real reason to doubt their legality. A consignee cannot 
be reasonably expected to be capable of discovering such patent or perverse error 
in the very genesis of the charge. It is something which only the authority that 
calculates, determines and notifies the levy of the charge could be said to know 
or at the very least ought to have known. Thus, Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 
cannot be said to encompass even “Illegal Charges” which are beyond the 
intention and object of the said provision, and the applicability of the prescribed 
time-limit must be confined only to claims for an ‘overcharge’. 
 
94. 
Therefore, a distinction has been envisaged between an ‘overcharge’ and 
an ‘illegal charge’, where the former relates to any excess sum paid due to a 
mistake which was capable of being discovered by exercise of proper vigilance 
and thus, ought to have been claimed within a period of 6-months. 
 
95. 
Lastly, we must also caution the courts and the railway claims tribunal of 
one another aspect, which is that where the court or tribunal whilst examining a 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

claim for refund finds that a particular charge for which refund is sought is not an 
overcharge, they must not jump to the conclusion that the said charge then is an 
illegal charge. The purpose of the above discussion was only to bring clarity over 
what would be an ‘overcharge’ for the purposes of Section 106 sub-section (3) of 
the Act, 1989. 
 
96. 
There may be situations, where a charge for which refund is sought may 
no be an overcharge or even an illegal charge and rather would be a lawful charge 
perfectly valid in the eyes of law, or a charge though valid but in the extant of 
equity may be refundable, the same has to be determined upon appraisal of the 
entire facts of the case. The courts and tribunal must be mindful of the fact that, 
the question as to what is the nature of a particular charge, be it overcharge or 
illegal charge or valid charge etc. is for ultimately determining whether it is liable 
for refund or not, without jumping to any conclusion. 
 
97. 
This is evinced from the decisions of Steel Authority of India Ltd. (supra) 
and National Aluminium Co. Ltd. (supra), where as per the mandate of the 
Central Government’s policy, the goods in question were required to be carried 
only over the longer route. Accordingly, the goods were booked and freight was 
also realized for the longer route, but the railways dispatched the goods by the 
shorter-route due to logistical issues. Even though the High Court found nothing 
wrong with either the policy or the freight charge realized, and held both to be 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

lawful, yet it directed refund in view of principles of equity by taking recourse to 
Section 72 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. 
 
98. 
Thus, from the above discussion, it is abundantly clear that there exists a 
very fine & clear distinction between an overcharge and an illegal charge, and 
that Section 106 sub-section (3) of the Act, 1989 only applies when the claim is 
for a refund of an overcharge, for all other charges, be it illegal or not, the said 
provision will have no application whatsoever. iii. 
Whether the present case is one of ‘Overcharge’ or ‘Illegal Charge’? a. 
Applicability of Section 106(3) of the Railways Act, 1989. 
 
99. 
Now coming to the facts of the present case at hand, it is the case of the 
respondent company herein that at the time of booking the consignments, from 
Baad to Hisar via Palwal, the notified chargeable distance for calculating freight 
as per the Local Distance Table was 444 km, and accordingly the respondent 
company paid the same from time to time. 
 
100. However, subsequently, the appellant railways vide its letter dated 
05.07.2005 changed the chargeable distance to 334 km in the revised Local 
Distance Table and the said revised table was to apply prospectively. It is 
undisputed that, at the time when the respondent company had booked its 
consignment, the notified chargeable distance was 444 km for Baad to Hisar, and 
any consignment booked for the said route was to be charged as per the said rate. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

101. The respondent company has contended that a change in the notified 
chargeable distance due to a change in policy was held to be illegal by this Court 
in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd. (supra). The High Court too whilst passing 
the impugned order has placed reliance on the said decision and held that the 
present case is squarely covered by the ratio of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd. 
(supra). 
 
102. However, we are not in agreement with the same. In Hindustan Petroleum 
Corp Ltd. (supra), the notified chargeable distance was 125 km, subsequently by 
the introduction of the Terminal Mechanism System (TMS) which was a 
computerized railway receipt system, the notified chargeable distance was 
reduced to 100 km. A close reading of the said decision would reveal that the 
change in the notified distance was attributable to a computerized receipt system, 
which had no bearing on the actual calculation of distance, in other words a 
receipt system had nothing to do with determining a chargeable distance. Thus, 
when the chargeable distance subsequent to the introduction of the said receipt 
system got altered and came out to be 100 km, this Court had no hesitation to 
hold that the initial notified distance of 125 km was illegal, and only upon the 
introduction of the TMS system, the said glaring patent error came into light. 
 
103. However, in the instant case, the change in the policy is in respect to the 
change in the methodology for calculation of chargeable distance, which has a 
direct bearing on the chargeable distance payable as per law. Thus, a mere change 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

in policy which results in the change of a charge payable as per law, will not 
render the original charge illegal, regard must be had to the nature of the policy 
and its effect. Thus, on this score, the High Court committed an error. 

104. The respondent company has also undisputedly paid the freight charges as 
per the notified chargeable distance, and nothing more has been charged than 
what was at the time of booking of the consignment required to be charged as per 
the law prevailing i.e., as per the old local distance table. 
 
105. The case of the respondent company is not that it has paid anything in 
excess of what was at the time of booking of the consignment required by law, 
rather, the respondent’s case is that the charge which was required to be paid by 
the law as prevailing at the time of booking of the consignment was wrong. In 
other words, the respondent’s case is that the very chargeable distance of 444 km 
as per the old local distance table was wrong, and not that the distance for which 
the respondent has been charged is incorrect in terms of the chargeable distance 
that was notified at that time. 
 
106. We are seisin of the fact that in J.K. Lakshmi (supra) and Mineral 
Enterprises (supra) the freight charged due to an incorrect chargeable distance 
was held to be an overcharge. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

106.1 However, a close reading of J.K. Lakshmi (supra) would reveal, that it 
was not a case where the notified chargeable distance was incorrect, but rather 
was a mistake of miscalculation on the part of the booking staff i.e., it was a 
clerical mistake and not a mistake attributable to a charge permitted and notified 
under the law. It does not appear that the said case was dealing with a situation 
where the notified or prescribed rate / chargeable distance was wrong, in fact the 
distance averred to be wrong is not a chargeable distance that has been notified 
in any manner. The relevant observations read as under: - 
 
“[...] The distance between two stations is stated to be only 511 KMs and 
the Railways alleged to had charged freight for distance of 946 KMs 
calculating the distance via Rewari. It was stated that because of this 
mistake in the calculation of the distance from the appellant-Company's 
Banas siding to Thiyat Hamira Railway Station, railway freight was 
charged in excess s.21.44 per qtl. instead of the applicable rate of 
Rs.13.11 per qtl. and paid under mistake. Consequently Rs.3,69,775/- 
was overpaid. This excess realisation was according to the appellant-
Company on the face of it arbitrary, unauthorized and illegal and thus 
refundable by the Railways with interest. xxx 
 
xxx 
 
xxx 
 
He submitted that the factum of the realisation of excess charge in an 
arbitrary and unauthorized manner by the Railway came to the notice of 
the appellant-Company only on or about 30.12.1987 when in the course 
of Government of India audit of the accounts of the appellant-Company 
with regard to supply of rakes of levy cement from its factory, it 
transpired that the excess freight had been unauthorizedly realized by 
the Railway in miscalculating the distance between Banas siding of the 
appellant-Company and place of delivery at Thiyat Hamira Railway 
station by wrongly measuring the distance as 946 KMs as against the 
actual distance of 511 KMs between the two stations. Counsel submitted 
that no sooner the letter dated 30.12.1987 was received by the appellant-
Company requisite notice were issued to the respondent-Railway on 
17.02.1988.[...] 
xxx 
 
xxx 
 
xxx 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

[...] In fact the appellant-company itself averred of realisation of an 
excess freight and specifically in para 6 of the plaint had itself averred 
that due to “mistake” in calculating of distance, excess freight was 
realised at the rate of Rs.21.44 per qtl. instead of Rs.13.11 per qtl.. 
Further in the notice under Section 78B of the Act of 1890 R/w Section 
80 CPC issued by the appellant-Company prior to the filing of the suit 
for recovery of money before the District Judge, Sirohi, it was submitted 
that due to mistake on the part of the booking staff of the Railways 
incorrect distance was computed from Banas siding to Thiyat Hamira 
railway station against the correct chargeable distance of 511 KMs and 
the distance was worked out to 946 KMs. which was the chargeable via 
Rewari. In para 4 of the suit it was stated that on the part of the Railway 
enhanced rate (emphasis mine) s.21.44 per qtl. was charged. In my 
considered opinion as also held by the learned Tribunal, the case set up 
by the appellant-Company makes it evidently clear that the refund was 
sought of the 
excess 
freight 
realizedallegedly 
illegally 
and 
unauthorizedly. The excess freight without doubt related to freight 
otherwise payable for the movement / transportation of goods by the 
Railways and therefore was obviously an overcharge. Consequently, 
Section 78B of the Act of 1890 attracted to the claim petition filed. 
Admittedly notice with regard to the freight paid between 07.12.1985 and 
11.02.1986 was issued on 17.02.1988 quite clearly beyond the period of 
six months as statutorily mandated. The Tribunal was right in so 
holding.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 

106.2 Similarly in Mineral Enterprises (supra), the wrong chargeable distance 
was in respect to the railway receipts which were issued that showed 365 km 
instead of 359 km. It was not a case of the notified rates being wrong i.e., the 
charge that has been made payable under law. This is further evinced by the fact 
that the High Court itself observed that the excess freight was charged than the 
“prescribed distance”. Thus, it appears that the mistake related to one in the 
“calculation of the distance” at the time of booking and doesn’t appear to be a 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

mistake in the “prescribed distance”. Similarly, even in the said decision, it is 
nowhere mentioned that, 365 km was a “notified chargeable distance”, thus, even 
this decision does not come in aid of the appellants herein. 
 
“14. It is an admitted fact that the respondent Company had transported 
the iron ore fines/minerals through the railways for the period from 
25.05.2006 to 04.01.2007 at the rates fixed by the railways. The main 
controversy was in respect of refund of excess freight charges said to 
have been collected by the railways than the prescribed rates fixed on 
the basis of distance. In that connection the respondent Company had 
sought for clarification about the actual distance for which the appellant 
railways gave the reply. As could be seen from the records the actual 
distance between Ammasandra to Panamburu is 358 kms., whereas the 
railways had calculated the distance as 365 kms., but they have collected 
the rates applicable for the distance above 360 Kms. It is an admitted 
fact that after clarification regarding actual distance, the railways had 
settled some of the claims of the respondent Company regarding excess 
charges which were within the limitation period. Some of the claims to 
an extent of Rs.8,85,000/- were rejected on the reason that they were 
barred by limitation. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to 
ascertain whether the repudiation of claims regarding Rs.8,85,000/- was 
justified. xxx 
 
xxx 
 
xxx 
 
24. In the aforesaid case the principal contention raised by the petitioner 
was that the claimant had discovered the mistake when the railway 
authorities confirmed by their letter that they had committed a mistake 
in charging excess freight on wrong calculation of distance. [...]” 

(Emphasis supplied) 
 
106.3 We do not propose to dwell any further on the decisions of J.K. Lakshmi 
(supra) and Mineral Enterprises (supra), and leave it at rest with just one 
observation that, as long as there is no error or patent illegality in the very genesis 
or core of a charge that has been notified i.e., the charge that has been made 
permissible or applicable by sanction of a law, it will not be an illegal charge. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

107. In view of the above, since admittedly, what was charged from the 
respondent was as per the chargeable distance notified and required to be payable 
by law at that time with nothing in excess, and since the respondent has 
challenged the very basis or genus of the charge i.e., primary challenge is to the 
chargeable distance of 444 km in itself and not the incidental quantum of freight 
levied on the distance of 444 km, and because the same was admittedly charged 
as per the prevailing law and not due to any misapplication or mistake i.e., as per 
the old local distance table, this clearly is not a case of overcharge and would not 
fall within the four corners of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989. b. 
Whether the chargeable distance of 444 km was correct or not? 
 
108. The respondent company herein has challenged the very validity or 
correctness of the notified chargeable distance of 444 km which was payable as 
per the old local distance table. At this stage, it would be apposite to understand 
on what basis, the respondent company has challenged the said chargeable 
distance of 444 km. 
 
109. The respondent company has contended that, initially the chargeable 
distance for the route from Refinery Baad to Hisar was 444 km as provided in the 
old local distance table. Subsequently, the appellant vide its letter dated 
05.07.2005 changed and reduced the chargeable distance to 334 km. The 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

respondent enquired and found out that, there was neither any change in the actual 
route nor any change in the physical track length between the Refinery Baad and 
Hisar stations. 
 
110. On such basis, the validity of the old chargeable distance of 444 km has 
come under cloud, and the respondent company has questioned how the 
chargeable distance came to be reduced by a difference of 110 km without there 
being any change in the actual distance in the route from Refinery Baad to Hisar. 
 
111. The appellant railways, submitted that pursuant to the Ministry of 
Railway’s letter dated 07.04.2004, a new methodology of ‘Rationalization and 
Rounding-off” was adopted by the railways for calculating the chargeable 
distance between any two pair of stations. As per the new methodology, the 
chargeable distance was now to be calculated on the basis of the actual 
engineering distance of the various stations reckoned upto two decimal points. 
For determining the chargeable distance, the actual entering distance (upto two 
decimal) of each station in the route is first added up, and then the aggregate is 
rounded-off to the next kilometre only once at the end. 
 
112. Furthermore, the new methodology had been adopted in order to bring 
uniformity in the procedure for determining chargeable distance throughout the 
railway, and the policy itself contemplated that the change in methodology would 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

likely result in variation from the existing freights and fares being levied under 
the old methodology. 
 
113. The appellants have contended that owing to this change in policy and 
methodology, the earlier chargeable distance of 444 km came to be reduced to 
334 km. The appellants have further submitted that the aforesaid letter dated 
07.04.2004, specifically stipulates that the said change would only apply 
prospectively and that any variation from the old fares and freights will not be 
entitled to any refund. 
 
114. We have gone through the aforesaid letter. Since the question before this 
Court pertains to the validity or correctness of the old chargeable distance of 444 
km as per the old methodology and not one of refund of past freight charges solely 
on basis of a subsequent change in methodology. Thus, the prospective 
application of the change in methodology as per the letter dated 07.04.2004 has 
no bearing whatsoever, with the question that is before this Court. 
 
115. The appellant railways has contended that the old chargeable distance of 
444 km was valid and correct as per the old methodology and distance table that 
was prevailing at that time, and thus, the respondent company is not entitled to a 
refund. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

116. Before, we proceed to determine the validity of the old chargeable distance 
of 444 km, we must try to understand the stance of the appellant railway in the 
present litigation, as discernible from their pleadings, which has left us quite 
perplexed. The argument of the appellant railways is twofold: - 

First, that the respondent company is not entitled to any refund whatsoever, 
since the change in chargeable distance was due to a change in the 
methodology, and that the old chargeable distance was correct as per the 
old methodology and distance table. 

Alternatively, it has been contended that, in the event this Court finds that 
the respondent is entitled to refund of the difference in chargeable distance, 
the same would at best be a case of ‘overcharge’ and the claim could be 
said to be time-barred in terms of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989. 
 
117. Thus, the primary thrust of the appellant’s contention is that this is neither 
a case of overcharge nor an illegal charge, as the old chargeable distance was 
valid as per the old methodology and distance table, thus, the respondent 
company is not entitled to any refund whatsoever. 
 
118. However, interestingly, despite maintaining the aforesaid stance that no 
case is made out for a refund, the appellant railway itself during the pendency of 
the matter before the Railway Claims Tribunal, Ghaziabad granted refund to the 
respondent company in approx. 45 claims that were made within the 6-month 
statutory time period. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

119. Prima-facie since the refund was not made by any adjudicatory authority 
it would have no bearing in the case of the appellant before this Court, however 
we should be mindful, that the appellant remarkably in its entire pleadings has 
nowhere explained why the refund was granted in the first place or even remotely 
indicated that the same had been granted due to a mistake. 
 
120. The appellant despite contending that the old chargeable distance of 444 
km was correct and valid as per the old methodology and the old distance table, 
the appellant has neither provided the complete old distance table nor explained 
what was the old methodology being used that resulted in a 110 km difference in 
the chargeable distance. 
 
121. As discussed by us above in this judgement, when a charge is alleged to be 
illegal, it would be too much to expect a consignee such as the respondent herein 
to prove that a particular charge is illegal or not. It is only the authority who 
formulated and prescribed a particular charge that may be capable of establishing 
that a particular charge is valid or not. The threshold of the ‘burden of proof’ if 
we may use that term that is required to be discharged, when challenging a 
particular charge as an “illegal charge”, is only on the preponderance of 
probabilities, upon which the onus will shift on the authorities to establish how 
the particular charge is valid. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

122. In the instant case, the respondent whilst challenging the validity of the 
chargeable distance of 444 km has submitted as follows: - 

a. That, the notification / communication whereby the chargeable distance was 
reduced from 444 km to 334 km had no bearing with the change in policy in 
the methodology for calculating the chargeable distance as alleged by the 
appellants herein. b. Further, the said communication shows that the chargeable distance was a 
matter of “correction” made after “critically reviewing” the old distance 
tables, and thus, indicating that the chargeable distance of 444 km was illegal. c. The respondent, upon enquiry from the concerned railway office came to 
learn, that there been no change in either the physical tracks or the route to 
warrant a change in the chargeable distance from 444 km to 334 km. 
 
123. The respondents have more than sufficiently showcased, how and why the 
chargeable distance of 444 km appears to be illegal. However, in response to the 
same the appellants herein have stated that, the chargeable distance of 444 km 
was correct as per the old distance table and the old methodology as prevailing, 
but have not been in a position to explain nor provide any documents to 
substantiate how the same was correct. Thus, except for a bald assertion, no other 
foundation has been laid for offering such a claim. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

124. Despite the aforesaid, we ourselves have undertaken the pains of 
examining the validity of the chargeable distance of 444 km. A close reading of 
the Ministry of Railway’s letter dated 07.04.2004 regarding the new 
rationalization methodology and a careful analysis of a small portion of the old 
distance table that was prevailing vis-à-vis the current distance table would give 
some insight and clarity over the old methodology that was being used to 
calculate the chargeable distance. For the purposes of explanation, the said 
distance tables are reproduced below: - 
 
Figure 1: Distance Table as per the Old Methodology 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

In the above distance table: - 
 “..” indicates the Originating Point, i.e., the station of origin from which 
the goods are booked / loaded for carriage. 
 Chargeable Distance from one station to another is calculated by the 
aggregate of the distance of all stations between the Originating Station 
and the Destination Station. 
 For example, the chargeable distance from Baad to Mathura is calculated 
by the actual engineering distance between the two pair of stations. 
 “(A)” to “(B)” indicates the actual engineering distance between Baad and 
Mathura. 
 “(C)” indicates the chargeable distance which is calculated by adding the 
distance between (A) & (B) and thereafter rounding off the aggregate to 
the next kilometre. 

Figure 2: Distance Table as per the New Methodology 

xxx 
 
xxx 
 
xxx 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

125. The striking difference between the Old Distance Table in Figure 1 and the 
New Distance Table in Figure 2 is that under the old methodology the distance 
between each station is being rounded-off, whereas in the new methodology the 
distance between each station is not rounded-off, and rather is indicated up-to two 
decimal points. Thus, in the Old Distance Table the chargeable distance between 
(A) Baad and (B) Mathura comes out to be (C) 11 km whereas under the New 
Distance Table distance between (A1) Baad and (B1) Mathura distance is 
indicated as 10.22 and upon rounding it off, the chargeable distance would come 
out to (C1) 11Km. 
 
126. Thus, prima-facie it appears that under both; the Old Distance Table and 
the New Distance Table, the actual engineering difference was being taken into 
consideration, and the only difference between the two methodologies lies in the 
rounding-off. Under the old methodology, the actual engineering distance for 
every station was being rounded-off to the next kilometre, whereas under the new 
methodology this was done away, and only the cumulative distance is being 
rounded-off only once at the very end to the next kilometre. 
 
127. Thus, when calculating the chargeable distance for a specific route under 
the old methodology, each station that exists in-between the route would at best 
add 1 km each. Thus, the extent to which the cumulative chargeable distance for 
a route would get inflated will roughly correspond to the number of stations it has 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

in its route, with each intervening station increasing the chargeable distance by a 
maximum of 1 km. 
 
128. This is further evinced from the fact that, the Ministry of Railway’s letter 
dated 07.04.2004 by which the new methodology was introduced, itself in the 
subject uses the words “Rounding off of Chargeable Distance: Rationalization of 
fares and freight”. This indicates that both methodologies utilized actual 
engineering distance with the only underlying difference between both of the 
them being in respect of rounding-off and nothing more. 
 
129. Furthermore, in the letter dated 05.07.2005 issued by the Chief Goods 
Supervisor (CGS), Northern Railway, whereby the chargeable distance from 
Refinery Baad to Hisar was reduced from 444 km to 334 km, it is nowhere 
mentioned that the same was done pursuant to the new methodology of 
“Rationalization of Rounding Off” or by virtue of the Ministry of Railway’s letter 
dated 07.04.2004 whereby the new methodology was introduced for the first time. 
 
130. The aforesaid letter dated 05.07.2005 of the CGS only goes so far as to say 
that the old distance tables were “critically reviewed” and that now the chargeable 
distance should be 334 km. In fact, the aforesaid letter further instructs CGS Baad 
that “the other disputed distance should also be corrected as per the new junction 
table and the correct distance should be charged”. The use of the words 
“disputed” and “corrected” used in the said letter clearly indicates that the 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

distance of 444 km was incorrect in itself, and that the change in the chargeable 
distance had nothing to do with the new methodology of ‘Rounding Off’. 
 
131. We are conscious of the fact that in the aforesaid letter dated 05.07.2005, 
it was indicated that the chargeable distance of 444 km was being levied as per 
the old distance table, and that the same was corrected as per the revised distance 
table. However, it must be borne in mind, that merely because the chargeable 
distance of 444 km was correct as per the old distance table will not ipso-facto 
make the chargeable distance of 444 km correct. 
 
132. The correctness of a chargeable distance is dependent upon the correct 
application of the methodology prescribed by law and correct calculation of the 
same pursuant to the methodology. A distance table, is a public document, which 
is available and displayed at each station, whenever a consignment is to be 
booked, the chargeable distance is calculated as per that distance table, had the 
distance table been incorrect, the respondent company would have disputed the 
same the very first moment when the consignment was probably being booked. 
 
133. We have no reason to doubt that the chargeable distance as calculated by 
the old distance table would have come out to 444 km, had it not, it would have 
been pointed out by the respondent company then and there. But merely because 
the calculation of the chargeable distance as per the old distance table is correct 
would not make the distance table correct as-well. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

134. The case of the respondent is that the calculation and application of the old 
methodology used for the formation of the distance table was incorrect, due to 
which inherent error has crept into the said distance table, thus it is the distance 
table which is incorrect and by its extension the chargeable distance of 444 km 
which is required to be payable by the law i.e., the notified distance table. 
 
135. Remarkably, even the Railway Claims Tribunal in its order had observed 
that the “actual distance” (emphasis) from Baad to Hissar was 334 km (sic 
333.18 km), and the sole reason why the RCT rejected the claims of the appellant 
was on the ground of being time-barred by Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989, which 
we have already stated, is not applicable in the instant case. The relevant 
observations read as under: - 
 
“18. [...] In this case, the goods were booked from ’A’ to ‘B’, showing 
the chargeable distance as 444 Kms. and payment was given by the 
applicant company for the same distance, but later on, Railways 
reworked the chargeable distance as only 333.18 Kms. The consignment 
in question was carried through the same route. So, it is clear that the 
payment was to be made for 333.18 Kms, whereas it was made for 444 
Kms. So, it is clear that the payment was to be made for 333.18 Kms., 
whereas it was made for 444 Kms. xxx 

xxx 

xxx 
 
22. [...] from the facts of the present case in hand, as in the present case, 
the applicant company was well within the knowledge of the actual 
distance from Baad to Hisar was 333.16 Kms, instead of 444 Kms.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
136. As afore-stated, since the only tangible difference between the old 
methodology and the new methodology is of rounding-off, the effect of change 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

in methodology upon the chargeable distance would have at best been limited or 
confined to a difference of 1 km for each corresponding intervening station. The 
route from Refinery Baad to Hisar has about 48 stations (approx..). It is not the 
case of the Appellant that there was any change in either the route by way of 
addition of new station or any change in the physical track length of the said route. 
Thus, a mere change in methodology would not have resulted in a difference of 
110 km in the chargeable distance. 
 
G. 
CONCLUSION 
137. Thus, we are of the considered opinion, that the chargeable distance of 444 
km was illegal, for the following reasons: - 

That, the effect of the change in methodology on the chargeable distance 
would not have resulted in a huge difference of 110 km, 

That, there had been neither any change in the route by way of addition of 
new station nor change in the physical track length of the said route, 

The letter dated 05.07.2005 itself indicates that the change in the 
chargeable distance of 444 km was due to an error, and has no bearing with 
the Ministry of Railway’s letter dated 07.04.2004 introducing the new 
methodology. 

The factum of the appellants themselves granting refund without 
explaining the reason for the same, despite their stance that the respondent 
is not entitled to any refund. 

Civil Appeal No(s). 1891-1966 of 2024 

The failure of the appellant in establishing that the chargeable distance of 
444 km was the correct chargeable distance as per the law. 

Concurrent findings of both, the Railway Claims Tribunal and the High 
Court on the limited aspect of the actual distance being 333.18 km. 
 
138. Thus, for all the foregoing reasons, we have reached to the conclusion that
