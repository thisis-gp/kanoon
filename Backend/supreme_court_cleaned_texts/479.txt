IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA 
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 

UJAGAR SINGH (DEAD) Thr. LRs. & ANR. 

VERSUS 
PUNJAB STATE & ORS. 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 
 
1. 
The present appeal assails the correctness of 
the judgment and order dated 09.03.2010 
passed by the High Court of Punjab & Haryana 
at Chandigarh in R.S.A No. 250 of 1983, 
whereby the High Court set aside the judgment 
and decree dated 25.9.1982 of the Additional 
District Judge, Hoshiarpur. The High Court 
held that the Civil Court's jurisdiction was 
barred under Section 21 of the Punjab Land 
Reforms Act, 19721. 
 
1 In short, the “Land Reforms Act” 

2. 
 The background of this case is as follows: 
 
2.1 The appellants, followers of the religious shrine 
of Dam Dama Baba Sahib Singh of Una, filed a 
suit for declaration and perpetual injunction 
against the respondents and one Smt. Sangeet 
Kaur, daughter of Baba Madhusudan Singh 
Sahib Una. The appellants contended that the 
land detailed in the headnote of the plaint was 
dedicated to the religious and charitable 
institution Dam Dama Sahib of Una, under the 
management 
and 
supervision 
of 
Baba 
Madhusudan Singh. 
 
2.2 The appellants pleaded that the shrine was 
worshipped by them and countless Sikhs. They 
asserted that Shri Kala Dhari, the founder of 
Una and a descendant of Baba Nanak, 
established 
the 
shrine, 
which 
was 
later 
managed by his successors. Shri Sahib Singh, 
the successor of Shri Kala Dhari, established 
another shrine at Quilla Jawahar Singh in 
Gujranwala (now in Pakistan), where followers 
gifted 
land 
for 
religious 
and 
charitable 

purposes. The income from these lands was 
used for maintaining the shrine and other 
charitable activities. 
2.3 Upon the partition of India, 1440 kanals and 8 
marlas of land were allotted to the Bedi families 
of Una in lieu of their land in Pakistan, 
including 735 kanals and 7 marlas allotted to 
Tikka Devinder Singh, a descendant of Baba 
Sahib Singh. The appellants argued that this 
land, though recorded in the name of Tikka 
Devinder Singh, was actually meant for the 
shrine and managed by Baba Madhusudan 
Singh. 
2.4 The appellants claimed that despite not having 
the 
right 
to 
transfer 
the 
land, 
Baba 
Madhusudan Singh transferred 156 kanals and 
8 marlas to the Agriculture Department of 
Punjab and 330 kanals and 14 marlas to his 
daughter, Sangeet Kaur. These transfers, the 
appellants contended, were illegal and not 
binding on the worshippers of the shrine. 
2.5 The Government of Punjab initiated proceedings 
to declare part of this land as surplus. The 
Collector, 
Agrarian, 
Hoshiarpur, 
declared 

20.0943 standard acres of the land as surplus 
on 28.06.1976. The appellants filed a suit for 
declaration and perpetual injunction, asserting 
that the land was of religious and charitable 
nature, and thus exempt under the Land 
Reforms Act. They sought a declaration that the 
land belonged to Dam Dama Sahib of Una and 
an injunction to prevent the respondents from 
transferring or declaring it surplus. 
2.6 The Trial Court framed several issues for 
determination, including whether the Civil 
Court had jurisdiction to try the suit under 
Section 21 of the Land Reforms Act. The Trial 
Court noted that the issue of jurisdiction was 
not pressed by the defendants during the 
proceedings and, regardless, decided it in favour 
of the plaintiffs. After considering the evidence, 
the 
Trial 
Court 
dismissed 
the 
suit 
on 
15.12.1980, holding that the appellants failed to 
prove that the land was dedicated to a religious 
and charitable institution. 
2.7 Aggrieved by the dismissal, the appellants filed 
an appeal before the Additional District Judge, 
Hoshiarpur. The First Appellate Court, by 

judgment and decree dated 25.09.1982, partly 
allowed the appeal. The Appellate Court 
concluded that 133/290 share of the land in the 
suit was charitable and belonged to Dam Dama 
Baba Sahib Singh of Una. The court held that 
this share could not be declared surplus by the 
Collector and restrained the respondents from 
making further transfers of this share of the 
land. 
 
3. 
The respondents, dissatisfied with the First 
Appellate Court's judgment, filed a Regular 
Second Appeal before the High Court of Punjab 
& Haryana. The High Court, vide its order dated 
09.03.2010, set aside the judgment and decree 
of the Additional District Judge, holding that the 
Civil Court's jurisdiction was barred under 
Section 21 of the Land Reforms Act. The High 
Court emphasized that the appellants had not 
challenged the order declaring the land surplus 
before the appropriate authorities under the 
Act, and thus, the suit was not maintainable. 
The same has been challenged giving rise to the 
present appeal. 

4. 
Having heard the arguments of both sides, this 
Court is of the opinion that the High Court fell 
in error in dismissing the suit primarily on the 
ground that the Civil Court's jurisdiction was 
barred by Section 21 of the Land Reforms Act. 
 
5. 
It is pertinent to note that the issue of 
jurisdiction was not pressed by the respondents 
during the Trial Court proceedings. The Trial 
Court specifically recorded that the issue of 
jurisdiction was not pressed and decided it in 
favour of the plaintiffs. The respondents did not 
challenge this finding in the First Appellate 
Court, and hence, they were precluded from 
raising it in the second appeal before the High 
Court. 
 
6. 
Section 21 of the Land Reforms Act reads as 
follows: 
 
“21. Bar of jurisdiction. 
(1)Save as provided by or under this Act, the 
validity of any proceedings or order taken or 
made under this Act shall not be called in 
question in any court or before any other 
authority. 

(2)No civil court shall have jurisdiction to 
entertain any suit, or proceed with any suit 
instituted after the appointed day, for 
specific performance of a contract for 
transfer of land which affects the right of the 
State Government to the surplus area under 
this Act.” 
 
7. 
Section 21 of the Land Reforms Act bars the 
jurisdiction of Civil Courts only in specific 
circumstances: 

suits 
for 
specific 
performance of a contract for transfer of land, 
and (b) questioning the validity of any 
proceeding or order taken or made under the 
Act. The present suit does not fall under either 
of these two categories. The appellants' suit was 
essentially for a declaration that the land 
belonged to the religious and charitable shrine 
Dam Dama Sahib, and there was no challenge 
to the validity of any order under the Act. The 
Civil Court alone has the jurisdiction to decide 
and declare whether the land belonged to the 
religious shrine or to Tikka Devinder Singh in 
his personal capacity. The suit filed by the 
appellants was not a challenge to the validity of 

the surplus order but a suit for declaration 
regarding the ownership of the land. 
 
8. 
In view of the above, the High Court's order is 
set aside. The matter is remitted back to the 
High Court for fresh consideration on merits in 
accordance with law. 

9. 
The appeal is accordingly allowed as above. 
 
10. There shall, however, be no order as to costs.
