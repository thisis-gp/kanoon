PART A 

1. 
The present batch of appeals involves the interplay of three Parliamentary 
statutes: the Income Tax Act 19611, the Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation 
and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Act 2020,2 and the Finance Act 2021. 
The Income Tax Act was enacted to levy and collect tax on the income of 
assesses.3 Sections 147 to 151 of the Income Tax Act deal with the procedure 
of reassessment of income chargeable to tax which has escaped 
assessment. The TOLA was enacted in the backdrop of the COVID-19 
pandemic to provide relaxation of time limits specified under the provisions of 
the Income Tax Act and certain other legislations as defined under Section 
2(1)(b) of TOLA. The Finance Act 2021 amended the provisions dealing with 
the reassessment procedure under the Income Tax Act with effect from 1 April 
2021. 
A. 
Background 
i. 
Income Tax Act 
2. 
Sections 147 to 151 deal with the procedure of reassessment. The scheme 
of reassessment under Sections 147 to 151 was substantially overhauled by 
the Finance Act 2021 with effect from 1 April 2021. Under the old regime, 
Section 147 empowered the assessing officer4 to reopen assessment

2 “TOLA” 
3 Section 2(7), Income Tax Act. [It defines an “assessee” to mean “a person by whom any tax or any other 
sum of money is payable under this Act, and includes – 

every person in respect of whom any proceeding under this Act has been taken for the assessment 
of his income or assessment of fringe benefits or of the income of any other person in respect of which he is 
assessable, or of the loss sustained by him or by such other person, or of the amount of refund due to him 
or to such other person; 

every person who is deemed to be an assessee under any provisions of this Act; 

every person who is deemed to be an assessee in default under any provision of this Act;”] 
4 Section 2(7A), Income Tax Act. [It defines an “assessing officer” to mean “the Assistant Commissioner or 
Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Director or Deputy Director or the Income-tax Officer who is vested with 

PART A 

proceedings if they had “reason to believe” that any income chargeable to tax 
has escaped assessment for the relevant assessment year.5 Section 148 
mandated the assessing officer to serve a notice on the assessee requiring 
them to submit a return of their income.6 
3. 
Section 1497 prescribed the following time limits for issuing a notice under 
Section 148 for an assessment year: 
 
the relevant jurisdiction by virtue of directions or orders issued under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of 
section 120 or any other provision of this Act, and the Additional Commissioner or Additional Director or Joint 
Commissioner or Joint Director who is directed under clause (b) of sub-section (4) of that section to exercise 
or perform all or any of the powers or functions conferred on, or assigned to, an Assessing Officer under this 
Act.”] 
5 Section 147, Income Tax Act 
6 Section 148, Income Tax Act. [It read: 
“148.(1) Before making the assessment, reassessment or recomputation under section 147, the Assessing 
Officer shall serve on the assessee a notice requiring him to furnish within such period, as may be specified 
in the notice, a return of his income or the income of any other person in respect of which he is assessable 
under this Act during the previous year corresponding to the relevant assessment year, in the prescribed 
form and verified in the prescribed manner and setting forth such other particulars as may be prescribed; and 
the provisions of this Act shall, so far as may be, apply accordingly as if such return were a return required 
to be furnished under section 139: 
Provided that in a case – 

where a return has been furnished during the period commencing on the 1st day of October, 1991 
and ending on the 30th day of September, 2005 in response to a notice served under this section, and 

subsequently a notice has been served under sub-section (2) of section 143 after the expiry of twelve 
months specified in the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 143, as it stood immediately before the 
amendment of said sub-section by the Finance Act, 2002 (20 of 2002) but before the expiry of the time limit 
for making the assessment, re-assessment or recomputation as specified in sub-section (2) of section 153, 
every such notice referred to in this clause shall be deemed to be a valid notice: 
Provided further that in a case – 

where a return has been furnished during the period commencing on the 1st day of October, 1991 
and ending on the 30th day of September, 2005 in response to a notice served under this section, and 

subsequently a notice has been served under clause (ii) of sub-section (2) of section 143 after the 
expiry of twelve months specified in the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 143, as it stood immediately 
before the amendment of said sub-section by the Finance Act, 2002 (20 of 2002) but before the expiry of the 
time limit for making the assessment, re-assessment or recomputation as specified in sub-section (2) of 
section 153, every such notice referred to in this clause shall be deemed to be a valid notice. 
Explanation – For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that nothing contained in the first proviso or 
the second proviso shall apply to any return which has been furnished on or after the 1st day of October 2005 
in response to a notice served under this section. 
(2) The Assessing Officer shall, before issuing any notice under this section, record his reasons for doing 
so.”] 
7 Section 149, Income Tax Act. [It reads: 
“149. Time limit for notice - (1) No notice under section 148 shall be issued for the relevant assessment 
year,— 
(a) if four years have elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment year, unless the case falls under 
clause (b) or clause (c); 
(b) if four years, but not more than six years, have elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment year 
unless the income chargeable to tax which has escaped assessment amounts to or is likely to amount to one 
lakh rupees or more for that year; 

PART A 

four years from the end of the relevant assessment year;

four years but not more than sixteen years from the end of the relevant 
assessment year if the income in relation to any asset (including 
financial interest in any entity) located outside India and chargeable to 
tax has escaped assessment. 
4. 
Section 151 required the assessing officer to obtain the sanction of the 
specified authority before issuing a notice under Section 148.8 In case the 
notice was issued within four years, the sanctioning authority was the Joint 
 
(c) if four years, but not more than sixteen years, have elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment year 
unless the income in relation to any asset (including financial interest in any entity) located outside India, 
chargeable to tax, has escaped assessment. 
Explanation.—In determining income chargeable to tax which has escaped assessment for the purposes of 
this sub-section, the provisions of Explanation 2 of section 147 shall apply as they apply for the purposes of 
that section. 
(2) The provisions of sub-section (1) as to the issue of notice shall be subject to the provisions of section 
151. 
(3) If the person on whom a notice under section 148 is to be served is a person treated as the agent of a 
non-resident under section 163 and the assessment, reassessment or recomputation to be made in 
pursuance of the notice is to be made on him as the agent of such non-resident, the notice shall not be issued 
after the expiry of a period of six years from the end of the relevant assessment year. 
Explanation.—For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that the provisions of sub-sections (1) and (3), 
as amended by the Finance Act, 2012, shall also be applicable for any assessment year beginning on or 
before the 1st day of April, 2012.”] 
8 Section 151, Income Tax Act. [It read: 
151.(1) No notice shall be issued under section 148 by an Assessing Officer, after the expiry of a period of 
four years from the end of the relevant assessment year, unless the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief 
Commissioner or Principal Commissioner or Commissioner is satisfied, on the reasons recorded by the 
Assessing Officer, that it is a fit case for the issue of such notice. 
(2) In a case other than a case falling under sub-section (1), no notice shall be issued under section 148 by 
an Assessing Officer, who is below the rank of Joint Commissioner, unless the Joint Commissioner is 
satisfied, on the reasons recorded by such Assessing Officer, that it is a fit case for the issue of such notice. 
(3) For the purposes of sub-section (1) and sub-section (2), the Principal Chief Commissioner or the Chief 
Commissioner or the Principal Commissioner or the Commissioner or the Joint Commissioner, as the case 
may be, being satisfied on the reasons recorded by the Assessing Officer about fitness of a case for the issue 
of notice under section 148, need not issue such notice himself.] 

PART A 

Commissioner.9 In case the notice was issued after the expiry of four years, 
the sanctioning authority was the Principal Chief Commissioner,10 Chief 
Commissioner,11 Principal Commissioner or Commissioner.12 The authorities 
have a distinct meaning under the Income Tax Act. Following a decision of 
this Court in GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd v. Income Tax Officer,13 the 
assessing officer was also required to furnish reasons for reopening 
assessments and give an opportunity of hearing to the assessee. 
5. 
The Revenue had to follow the following procedure for reopening assessment 
under the old regime: 

Section 147 allowed the assessing officer to reassess any income 
chargeable to tax if the officer had “reasons to believe” that such 
income escaped assessment; 

The assessing officer had to ensure that the notice under Section 148 
was issued within the time limits prescribed under Section 149; 
 
9 Section 2(28C) of the Income Tax Act defines Joint Commissioner to mean “a person appointed to be a 
Joint Commissioner of Income-tax or an Additional Commissioner of Income-tax under sub-section (1) of 
section 117.” 
10 Section 2(34-A) of the Income Tax Act defines Principal Chief Commissioner of Income tax to mean “a 
person appointed to be a Principal Chief Commissioner of Income-tax under sub-section (1) of section 117.” 
11 Section 2(15A) of the Income Tax Act defines a Chief Commissioner to mean “a person appointed to a 
Chief Commissioner of Income tax or a Director General of Income tax or a Principal Chief Commissioner of 
Income tax or a Principal Director General of Income-tax under sub-section (1) of Section 117.” 
12 Section 2(16) defines Principal Commissioner or Commissioner to mean “a person appointed to be a 
Principal Commissioner or Commissioner of Income tax or a Principal Director or Director of Income tax or a 
Principal Commissioner of Income tax or a Principal Director of Income tax under sub-section (1) of section 
117.” 
13 (2003) [5]. It reads: 
“5. […] However, we clarify that when a notice under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act is issued, the proper 
course of action for the noticee is to file return and if he so desires, to seek reasons for issuing notices. The 
assessing officer is bound to furnish reasons within a reasonable time. On receipt of reasons, the noticee is 
entitled to file objections to issuance of notice and the assessing officer is bound to dispose of the same by 
passing a speaking order. In the instant case, as the reasons have been disclosed in these proceedings, the 
assessing officer has to dispose of the objections, if filed, by passing a speaking order, before proceeding 
with the assessment in respect of the abovesaid five assessment years.”] 

PART A 

The assessing officer had to obtain the sanction of the specified 
authority under Section 151 before issuing a reassessment notice; 

The assessing officer had to grant an opportunity of hearing to the 
assessee in terms of GKN Driveshafts (supra); and 

The assessing officer was thereafter empowered to issue a notice of 
reassessment under Section 148. ii.

On 24 March 2020, the Central Government announced “a complete 
lockdown for the entire nation” for twenty-one days to contain the spread of 
the COVID-19 pandemic.14 Following this, the Central Government sought to 
implement various relief measures to redress the challenges faced by the 
taxpayers in meeting the statutory requirements due to the pandemic.15 On 
31 March 2020, the President of India promulgated the Taxation and Other 
Laws (Relaxation of Certain Provisions) Ordinance 202016 to extend time 
limits for completion or compliance of actions under the specified Acts falling 
for completion or compliance between 20 March 2020 and 29 June 2020 till 
30 June 2020. On 24 June 2020, the Central Government issued a notification

PART A 

Substantial changes were brought about by the new regime. Broadly 
speaking, they are summarized thus: 

Section 14819 mandates the assessing officer to initiate proceedings only 
based on prior information and with the prior approval of the specified 
authority;

unless the Assessing Officer has in his possession books of account or other documents or evidence which

amounts to or is likely to amount to fifty lakh rupees or more for that year: 
Provided that no notice under section 148 shall be issued at any time in a case for the relevant assessment 
year beginning on or before 1st day of April, 2021, if such notice could not have been issued at that time on 
account of being beyond the time limit specified under the provisions of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of this

PART A 

proviso to Section 149 prohibits the issuance of a reassessment notice 
under the new regime if such notices have become time-barred under 
the old regime; and 

The sanctioning authorities specified under Section 151 of the new 
regime are different from those specified under the old regime.22 Section 
151 of the new regime specifies the following authorities for Section 148 
and 148A: (i) Principal Commissioner or Principal Director23 or 
Commissioner or Director if three years or less have elapsed from the 
end of the relevant assessment year; and (ii) Principal Chief 
Commissioner or Principal Director General or Chief Commissioner or 
Director General if more than three years have elapsed from the end of 
the relevant assessment year. 
11. The notifications dated 31 March 2021 and 27 April 2021 issued by the 
Central Government under Section 3(1) of TOLA contained an explanation 
declaring that the provisions under the old regime shall apply to the 
reassessment proceedings initiated under them.24 Thus, the notifications 
 
22 Section 151, Income Tax Act. [It reads: 
151. Sanction for issue of notice – Specified authority for the purposes of section 148 and section 148A shall 
be, - 
(i) Principal Commissioner or Principal Director or Commissioner or Director, if three years or less than three 
years have elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment year; 
(ii) Principal Chief Commissioner or Principal Director General or where there is no Principal Chief 
Commissioner or Principal Director General, Chief Commissioner or Director General, if more than three 
years have elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment year.”] 
23 Section 2(21) of the Income Tax Act defines Principal Director General or Director General or Principal 
Director or Director to mean “a person appointed to be a Principal Director General or Director General of 
Income tax or a Principal Director General or Director General of Income tax or, as the case may be, a 
Principal Director or Director of Income tax or Principal Director of Income tax, under sub-section (1) of 
Section 117, and includes a person appointed under that sub-section to be an Additional Director of Income 
tax or a Joint Director of Income tax or as Assistant Director or Deputy Director of Income tax.” 
24 Notification No. 20 of 2021 dt. 31 March 2021; Notification No. 38 of 2021 dt. 27 April 2021. [The 
explanation reads: 
“Explanation – For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that for the purposes of issuance of notice 
under section 148 as per time-limit specified in section 149 or sanction under section 151 of the Income-tax 
Act, under this sub-clause, the provisions of section 148, section 149 and section 151 of the Income-tax Act, 

PART A 

directed the assessing officers to apply the provisions of the old regime for 
reassessment notices issued after 1 April 2021. The assessing officers 
accordingly issued reassessment notices between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 
2021 by relying on the provisions under Section 148 of the old regime. These 
reassessment notices were challenged by the assesses before various High 
Courts.25 
12. The High Courts allowed the writ petitions and quashed all the reassessment 
notices issued between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2021 under the old regime 
on the ground that: (i) Sections 147 to 151 stood substituted by Finance Act 
2021 from 1 April 2021;26 (ii) In the absence of any saving clause, the 
Revenue could initiate reassessment proceedings after 1 April 2021 only in 
accordance with the provisions of the new regime since they were remedial, 
beneficial, and meant to protect the rights and interests of the assesses;27 
and (iii) the Central Government could not exercise its delegated authority to 
“re-activate the pre-existing law.”28 
13. In Union of India v. Ashish Agarwal,29 this Court held that it was “in 
complete agreement with the view taken by various High Courts in holding” 
that “the benefit of the new provisions shall be made available even in respect 
 
as the case may be, as they stood as on the 31st day of March 2021, before the commencement of the 
Finance Act, 2021, shall apply.”]

PART A 

of the proceedings relating to past assessment years, provided Section 148 
notice has been issued on or after 1-4-2021.” However, the Court observed 
that the Revenue issued the reassessment notices under a “bona fide belief 
that the amendments may not yet have been enforced.” This Court exercised 
its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 142 in order to balance the interests 
of the Revenue and the assesses and directed that the reassessment notices 
issued under the old regime shall be deemed to have been issued under 
Section 148-A(b) of the new regime. This Court issued the following 
directions: 
“28. In view of the above and for the reasons stated 
above, the present appeals are allowed in part. The 
impugned common judgments and orders passed by 
the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in WT No. 
524 of 2021 and other allied tax appeals/petitions, 
is/are hereby modified and substituted as under: 
28.1. The impugned Section 148 notices issued to 
the respective assessees which were issued under 
unamended Section 148 of the IT Act, which were 
the subject-matter of writ petitions before the various 
respective High Courts shall be deemed to have 
been issued under Section 148-A of the IT Act as 
substituted by the Finance Act, 2021 and construed 
or treated to be show-cause notices in terms of 
Section 148-A(b). The assessing officer shall, within 
thirty days from today provide to the respective 
assessees information and material relied upon by 
the Revenue, so that the assessees can reply to the 
show-cause notices within two weeks thereafter. 
28.2. The requirement of conducting any enquiry, if 
required, with the prior approval of specified 
authority 
under 
Section 
148-A(a) 
is 
hereby 
dispensed with as a one-time measure vis-à-vis 
those notices which have been issued under Section 
148 of the unamended Act from 1-4-2021 till date, 
including those which have been quashed by the 
High Courts. 

PART A 

28.3. Even otherwise as observed hereinabove 
holding any enquiry with the prior approval of 
specified authority is not mandatory but it is for the 
assessing officers concerned to hold any enquiry, if 
required. 
28.4. The assessing officers shall thereafter pass 
orders in terms of Section 148-A(d) in respect of 
each of the assessees concerned; Thereafter after 
following the procedure as required under Section 
148-A may issue notice under Section 148 (as 
substituted). 
28.5. All defences which may be available to the 
assessees including those available under Section 
149 of the IT Act and all rights and contentions which 
may be available to the assessees concerned and 
Revenue under the Finance Act, 2021 and in law 
shall continue to be available.” 
14. On 11 May 2022, the Central Board of Direct Taxes issued an Instruction30 for 
the implementation of the decision Ashish Agarwal (supra). The Instruction 
“clarified” that Ashish Agarwal (supra) will apply “to all cases where 
extended reassessment notices have been issued […] irrespective of the fact 
whether such notices have been challenged or not.” Paragraph 6.1 of the 
Instruction stated that the reassessment notices will “travel back in time to 
their original date when such notices were to be issued and then new section 
149 of the Act is to be applied at that point.” Thus, the Instruction is based on 
the presumption that the notices issued under Section 148 of the new regime 
will travel back in time to their original dates, that is, the date when the Section 
148 notice under the old regime was issued. 
 
30 Instruction No. 01/2022 dt. 11 May 2022 

PART A 

15. Paragraph 6.2 of the Instruction elaborated on the mechanism for issuing 
notices under Section 148 of the new regime: 
“6.2 Based on the above, the extended assessment 
notices are to be dealt with as under: 
AY 2013-14, AY 2014-15 and AY 2015-16: Fresh 
notice under section 148 of the Act can be issued in 
these cases, with the approval of the specified 
authority, only if the case falls under clause (b) of 
sub-section (1) of section 149 as amended by the 
Finance Act, 2021 and reproduced in paragraph 6.1 
above. Specified authority under section 151 of the 
new law in this case shall be the authority prescribed 
under clause (ii) of that section. 
AY 16-17, AY 17-18: Fresh notice under Section 148 
can be issued in these cases, with the approval of 
the specified authority, under clause (a) of sub-
section (1) of new section 149 of the Act, since they 
are within the period of three years from the end of 
the relevant assessment year. Specified authority 
under section 151 of the new law in this case shall 
be the authority prescribed under clause (i) of that 
section.” 
16. The assessing officers accordingly considered the replies furnished by the 
assesses and passed orders under Section 148A(d). Subsequently, notices 
under Section 148 of the new regime were issued to the assesses by the 
assessing officers between July and September 2022 for the assessment 
years 2013-2014, 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018. These 
notices were challenged before several High Courts. The High Courts 
declared the notices to be invalid on the ground that they were: (i) time-barred; 
and (ii) issued without the appropriate sanction of the specified authority.

PART B 

17. In Ashish Agarwal (supra), this Court was called upon to decide whether the 
Revenue was correct in issuing the reassessment notices under the old 
regime when the new regime, which was beneficial to the assesses, was 
already in force. This Court resolved the issue by holding that all 
reassessment notices issued after 1 April 2021 should have been issued in 
accordance with the new regime. However, the Court construed the notices 
issued under Section 148 of the old regime by deeming them to be notices 
issued under Section 148A(b) of the new regime. In Ashish Agarwal (supra), 
this Court did not deal with the issue of whether or not the reassessment 
notices were issued within the time limits prescribed under the provisions of 
the Income Tax Act read with the relaxations provided under TOLA. This is 
the primary issue that comes up for our consideration in the present batch of 
appeals. 
B. 
Issues 
18. The present batch of appeals gives rise to the following issues: 
a. Whether TOLA and notifications issued under it will also apply to 
reassessment notices issued after 1 April 2021; and 
b. Whether the reassessment notices issued under Section 148 of the new 
regime between July and September 2022 are valid.

PART C 

C. 
Submissions 
19. Mr N Venkataraman, learned Additional Solicitor General of India, made the 
following submissions on behalf of the Revenue: 
a. Parliament enacted TOLA as a free-standing legislation to provide relief and 
relaxation to both the assesses and the Revenue during the time of COVID-
19. TOLA seeks to relax actions and proceedings that could not be 
completed or complied with within the original time limits specified under the 
Income Tax Act; 
b. Section 149 of the new regime provides three crucial benefits to the 
assesses: (i) the four-year time limit for all situations has been reduced to 
three years; (ii) the first proviso to Section 149 ensures that re-assessment 
for previous assessment years cannot be undertaken beyond six years; and 
(iii) the monetary threshold of Rupees fifty lakhs will apply to the re-
assessment for previous assessment years; 
c. The relaxations provided under Section 3(1) of TOLA apply “notwithstanding 
anything contained in the specified Act.” Section 3(1), therefore, overrides 
the time limits for issuing a notice under Section 148 read with Section 149 
of the Income Tax Act; 
d. TOLA does not extend the life of the old regime. It merely provides a 
relaxation for the completion or compliance of actions following the 
procedure laid down under the new regime; 
e. The Finance Act 2021 substituted the old regime for re-assessment with a 
new regime. The first proviso to Section 149 does not expressly bar the 
application of TOLA. Section 3 of TOLA applies to the entire Income Tax Act, 

PART C 

including Sections 149 and 151 of the new regime. Once the first proviso to 
Section 149(1)(b) is read with TOLA, then all the notices issued between 1 
April 2021 and 30 June 2021 pertaining to assessment years 2013-2014, 
2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 will be within the period 
of limitation as explained in the tabulation below:

f. The Revenue concedes that for the assessment year 2015-16, all notices 
issued on or after 1 April 2021 will have to be dropped as they will not fall for 
completion during the period prescribed under TOLA; 
g. Section 2 of TOLA defines “specified Act” to mean and include the Income 
Tax Act. The new regime, which came into effect on 1 April 2021, is now part 
of the Income Tax Act. Therefore, TOLA continues to apply to the Income 
Tax Act even after 1 April 2021; and 
h. Ashish Agarwal (supra) treated Section 148 notices issued by the Revenue 
between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2021 as show-cause notices in terms of 
Section 148A(b). Thereafter, the Revenue issued notices under Section 148 

PART C 

of the new regime between July and August 2022. Invalidation of the Section 
148 notices issued under the new regime on the ground that they were 
issued beyond the time limit specified under the Income Tax Act read with 
TOLA will completely frustrate the judicial exercise undertaken by this Court 
in Ashish Agarwal (supra). 
20. Mr Percy Pardiwalla, Mr V Sridharan, Mr Tushar Hemani, Mr Saurabh 
Soparkar, and Mr K Shivram, learned senior counsel, Mr Manish Shah, Mr 
Darshan Patel, Mr Suhrith Parthasarthy, Mr Dharan Gandhi, and Mr Ved Jain, 
learned counsel, made the following submissions on behalf of the 
respondents: 
a. TOLA applies only when the period of limitation expires between 20 March 
2020 and 31 March 2021. Finance Act 2021 was enacted after TOLA. 
Consequently, TOLA only held the field till the new regime came into effect 
from 1 April 2021. The Revenue had to issue Section 148 notices in terms 
of the new regime without recourse to the extended timelines under TOLA; 
b. TOLA did not amend the erstwhile Section 149 but merely extended the 
specified time limits. The first proviso to Section 149(1)(b) only refers to the 
period of limitation under the erstwhile Section 149(1)(b); 
c. Notification No. 38 of 2021 was issued on 27 April 2021 to extend the time 
limits expiring under Section 149(1)(b) of the old regime till 30 June 2021. 
The notification was issued after 1 April 2021, when the old regime was 
repealed and substituted by a new regime. Therefore, this notification 
cannot be read into the new regime; 
d. The notices can be categorized into the following four categories: 

PART C 

i. 
First category: for assessment years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, the 
six-year time limit in terms of Section 149 expired on 31 March 2020 
and 31 March 2021 respectively. However, the reassessment notices 
were issued after 1 April 2021 and would be barred by limitation; 
ii. 
Second category: for the assessment year 2015-2016, the issue 
pertains to whether the sanction of the appropriate authority was 
obtained by the assessing officers before issuing re-assessment 
notices under Section 148 of the old regime. For this category of 
cases, the four-year period expired on 31 March 2020. However, 
notices were issued after 31 March 2020 by obtaining sanction under 
Section 151(2) instead of Section 151(1) of the old regime; 
iii. 
Third category: for assessment years 2016-2017 and 2017-2018, the 
three-year period in terms of the amended regime expired on 31 
March 2020 and 31 March 2021, respectively. The notices under 
Section 148 were issued after the expiry of three years, that is, after 
1 April 2021. However, the sanctions were obtained under Section 
151(i) instead of Section 151(ii) of the new regime; and 
iv. 
The directions issued by this Court in Ashish Agarwal (supra) were 
not intended to apply to assesses who did not challenge the 
reassessment notices before the High Courts or this Court. Therefore, 
reassessment proceedings could not have been initiated for such 
assesses. e. The applicability of the first proviso to Section 149(1)(b) of the new regime 
has to be tested on the date of issuance of notice under Section 148 of the 

PART D 

new regime. Even if TOLA is read into the Income Tax Act, the time limits for 
completion or compliance of actions can be extended till 30 June 2021. 
However, the notices under Section 148 of the new regime were issued by 
the Revenue from July to September 2022. The period of July to September 
2022 is beyond the extended time limits stipulated under the Income Tax Act 
read with TOLA; 
f. Ashish Agarwal (supra) cannot be interpreted in a manner to exclude the 
entire period from April 2021 to September 2022. The directions issued by 
this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution cannot contravene the 
substantive provisions contained in the Income Tax Act. Moreover, this Court 
in Ashish Agarwal (supra) expressly left open all the defences available to 
the assesses under the new regime, including the defence of limitation 
available under Section 149; and 
g. TOLA is only applicable to the provisions that specify time limits. Section 
151 does not prescribe any time limit for the issuance of sanctions by the 
specified authorities. Therefore, TOLA does not apply to Section 151. 
D. 
Legal Background 
i. 
Assessment as a quasi-judicial function 
21. The power to levy tax is an essential and inherent attribute of sovereignty.31 
It is an inherent attribute because the government requires funds to discharge 
its governmental functions.32 Taxation is also a recognised fiscal tool to 
 
31 Jindal Stainless Ltd v. State of Haryana, (2017) [17]; [310]

Parekh & Co., (2000) [8] 

PART D 

achieve fiscal and social objectives.33 Although the power to levy taxes is 
plenary, it is subject to certain well-defined limitations. Article 265 of the 
Constitution provides that no tax shall be levied or collected except by 
authority of law. A taxing statute must be valid and conform to other provisions 
of the Constitution.34 
22. Article 265 makes a distinction between “levy” and “collection.” The 
expression “levy” has a wider connotation. It includes both the imposition of a 
tax as well as assessment.35 The quantum of tax levied by a taxing statute, 
the conditions subject to which it is levied, and how it is sought to be recovered 
are all matters within the competence of the legislature.36 In a taxing statute, 
the charging provisions are generally accompanied by a set of provisions for 
computing or assessing the levy. The character of assessment provisions 
bears a relationship to the nature of the charge.37 
23. Thomas Cooley describes assessment as the most important of all the 
proceedings in taxation. He further describes the necessity of assessment 
thus: 
“An assessment, when taxes are to be levied upon a 
valuation, is obviously indispensable. It is required 
as the first step in the proceedings against individual 
subjects of taxation, and is the foundation of all 
which follow it. Without an assessment they have no 
support, and are nullities. The assessment is, 
therefore, the most important of all the proceedings 
in taxation, and the provisions to insure its 
accomplishing its office are commonly very full and 
particular. If there is no valid assessment, a tax on

PART D 

sale of lands is a nullity. A want of assessment is not 
a mere irregularity remedied by a curative statute. 
On the other hand, no assessment is necessary 
where the statute itself prescribes the amount to be 
paid, and this can be recovered by suit. For instance, 
where a statute imposes a tax at a specified rate 
upon bank deposits, no other assessment other than 
that made by the statute itself is necessary.”38 
24. The expression “assessment” comprehends the entire procedure for 
ascertaining and imposing liability upon taxpayers.39 The process of 
assessment involves computation of the income of the assessees, 
determination of tax payable by them, and the procedure for collecting or 
recovering tax.40 An assessing officer is concerned with the assessment and 
collection of revenue. An assessing officer must administer the provisions of 
the Income Tax Act in the interests of the public revenue and to prevent 
evasion or escapement of tax legitimately due to the State.41 
25. In Province of Bombay v. Khushaldas S Advani,42 Justice S R Das (as the 
learned Chief Justice then was), in his concurring opinion observed that if a 
statutory authority has the power to perform any act that will prejudicially 
affect the subject, then although there are no two parties apart from the 
authority and the contest is between the authority proposing to do the act and

the subject opposing it, the final determination of the authority will be quasi-
judicial provided the authority is required by the statute to act judicially. A 
quasi-judicial authority is under an obligation to act judicially.43 
26. An assessment acquires finality on the making of an assessment order by the 
assessing officer.44 It creates a vested right in favour of the assessee.45 
Section 2(8) of the Income Tax Act defines “assessment” to include 
reassessment. Reassessment is nothing but a fresh assessment.46 The effect 
of reopening the assessment is to vacate or set aside the order of assessment 
and to substitute in its place the order of reassessment.47 The procedure of 
reassessment of tax is quasi-judicial because it prejudicially affects the vested 
rights48 of the assessee. In CIT v. Simon Carves Ltd.,49 Justice H R Khanna, 
speaking for a Bench of three Judges, explained the quasi-judicial function 
performed by the assessing officers during the process of assessment and 
reassessment thus: 
“10. […] The taxing authorities exercise quasi-
judicial powers and in doing so they must act in a fair 
and not a partisan manner. Although it is part of their 
duty to ensure that no tax which is legitimately due 
from an assessee should remain unrecovered they 
must also at the same time not act in a manner as 
might indicate that scales are weighted against the 
assessee. We are wholly unable to subscribe to the 
view that unless those authorities exercise the power 
in a manner most beneficial to the revenue and 
consequently most adverse to the assessee, they

should be deemed not to have exercised it in a 
proper and judicious manner.” 
27. Since the assessing officers perform a quasi-judicial function during 
reassessment, the powers vested in them are regulated by law.50 The process 
of reassessment is generally preceded by administrative proceedings, which 
require the assessing officer to obtain the sanction of the specified 
authorities.51 The taxing statutes generally lay down the procedure for 
issuance of notice to the proposed assessee in respect of income or property 
proposed to be taxed. It also prescribes the authority and procedure for 
hearing any objections to the liability for taxation.52 
ii. 
Assessment as an issue of jurisdiction 
28. Jurisdiction is defined as the power of a court, tribunal, or authority to hear 
and determine a cause or exercise any judicial power concerning such 
cause.53 The Revenue officers must have requisite jurisdiction to perform their 
functions and responsibilities following the provisions of the Income Tax Act. 
Under the Income Tax Act 1922,54 Section 34 allowed an Income Tax Officer 
to reassess income that escaped assessment for a relevant assessment year. 
Section 34 provided that a reassessment notice could not be issued beyond 
the prescribed time limit (which was generally within eight years from the end 
 
50 Supdt. of Taxes v. Onkarmal Nathmal Trust, (1976) [37]; 
51 S Narayanappa v. CIT, [4] [“4. […] The proceedings for assessment or re-
assessment under Section 34(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act start with the issue of a notice and it is only after 
the service of the notice that the assessee, whose income in sought to be assessed or re-assessed, becomes 
a party to those proceedings. The earlier stage of the proceeding for recording the reasons of the Income 
Tax Officer and for obtaining the sanction of the Commissioner are administrative in character and are not 
quasi-judicial.]

of the relevant assessment year). Thus, Section 34 conferred jurisdiction on 
Income Tax Officers to reopen an assessment subject to the issuance of 
notice within the prescribed time limits.55 In Ahmedabad Manufacturing and 
Calico Printing Co. Ltd. v. S G Mehta, ITO,56 Justice M Hidayatullah (as the 
learned Chief Justice then was), writing for himself and Justice Raghubar 
Dayal, observed: 
“It must be remembered that if the Income-tax Act 
prescribes a period during which the tax due in any 
particular assessment year may be assessed, then 
on the expiry of that period the department cannot 
make an assessment. Where no period is prescribed 
that assessment can be completed at any time but 
once completed it is final. Once a final assessment 
has been made, it can only be reopened to rectify 
a mistake apparent from the record (section 35) 
or to reassess where there has been an 
escapement of assessment of income for one 
reason or another (section 34). Both these 
sections which enable reopening of back 
assessments provide their own periods of time 
for action but all these periods of time, whether 
for the first assessment or for rectification, or for 
reassessment, merely create a bar when that 
time passed against the machinery set up by the 
Income-tax Act for the assessment and levy of 
the tax. They do not create an exemption in 
favour of the assessee or grant an absolution on 
the expiry of the period. The liability is not 
enforceable but the tax may again become 
exigible if the bar is removed and the taxpayer is 
brought within the jurisdiction of the said 
machinery by reasons of a new power. This is, of 
course, subject to the condition that the law 
must say that such is the jurisdiction, either 
expressly or by clear implication. If the language 
of the law has that clear meaning, it must be given 
that effect and where the language expressly so 
declares or clearly implies it, the retrospective

operation is not controlled by the commencement 
clause.” 
29. In S S Gadgil v. Lal & Co., a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that the 
period prescribed under Section 34 of the Income Tax Act 1922 “is not a 
period of limitation.”57 It was further observed that Section 34 “imposes a fetter 
upon the power of the Income Tax Officer to bring to tax escaped income” by 
prescribing “different periods in different classes of cases for enforcement of 
the right of the States to recover tax.”58 Under Section 34, Income Tax Officers 
were statutorily barred from issuing a notice of assessment or reassessment 
after the expiry of the statutory time limit prescribed under the Income Tax 
Act. Consequently, reassessment notices issued by the Revenue beyond the 
prescribed time limits were declared invalid for being time-barred.59 
Assessment proceedings that have attained finality under existing law due to 
a time bar cannot be held to be open for revival unless the amended provision 
is given retrospective effect to allow upsetting the legal proceedings.60 
30. If a statute expressly confers a power or imposes a duty on a particular 
authority, then such power or duty must be exercised or performed by that 
authority itself.61 Further, when a statute vests certain power in an authority 
to be exercised in a particular manner, then that authority has to exercise its 
power following the prescribed manner.62 Any exercise of power by statutory

authorities inconsistent with the statutory prescription is invalid.63 Section 34 
of the Income Tax Act 1922 prescribed a duty on Income Tax Officers to seek 
prior approval of the Commissioner before issuing a reassessment notice. In 
CIT v. Maharaja Pratapsingh Bahadur of Gidhaur,64 a three-Judge Bench 
of this Court held that a notice issued under Section 34 without prior approval 
of the Commissioner was invalid. 
31. The Income Tax Act 1961 also mandates assessing officers to fulfil certain 
pre-conditions before issuing a notice of reassessment. Section 149 requires 
assessing officers to issue a notice of reassessment under Section 148 within 
the prescribed time limits. Further, Section 151 requires assessing officers to 
obtain sanction of the specified authority before issuing notice under Section 
148. In Chhugamal Rajpal v. S P Chaliha, a three-Judge Bench of this Court 
held that Section 151 must be strictly adhered to because it contains 
“important safeguards.”65 
32. A statutory authority may lack jurisdiction if it does not fulfil the preliminary 
conditions laid down under the statute, which are necessary to the exercise 
of its jurisdiction.66 There cannot be any waiver of a statutory requirement or 
provision that goes to the root of the jurisdiction of assessment.67 An order 
passed without jurisdiction is a nullity. Any consequential order passed or 
action taken will also be invalid and without jurisdiction.68 Thus, the power of

PART D 

assessing officers to reassess is limited and based on the fulfilment of certain 
preconditions.69 
iii. 
Principles of strict interpretation and workability 
33. The dominant purpose in interpreting a taxing statute is to ascertain the 
intention of the legislature to impose a charge.70 A literal rule of construction 
requires the language of a statute to be construed according to its literal and 
grammatical meaning, whatever the result may be.71 In comparison, a strict 
interpretation of a statute does not encompass strict literalism, which leads to 
absurdity or goes against the express legislative intent.72 The principle of strict 
interpretation requires the courts to interpret and decipher the meaning of the 
words of the statute in their usual sense.73 
34. Taxing statutes are interpreted by following the principles of strict 
interpretation.74 While interpreting a taxing statute, there is no room for any 
intendment.75 A taxing statute must be construed by having regard to the strict 
letter of the law.76 In a taxing statute, it is not possible to assume any intention 
or governing purpose more than what is stated in the plain language. A taxing 
statute can successfully impose liability on persons or property only if it 
frames appropriate provisions to that end. The courts cannot plug in a 
loophole in a taxing statute “by a strained construction in reference to the

supposed intention of the Legislature.”77 Further, the considerations of equity 
or justice are not relevant in interpreting a taxing statute.78 
35. It is a well-accepted rule of construction that in situations where the 
interpretation of taxing legislation is ambiguous or leads to two possible 
interpretations, the interpretation most beneficial to the subject of the tax 
should be adopted.79 It would not be an unjust result if a taxpayer escapes 
the tax net on account of the legislature’s failure to express itself clearly.80 
36. In a taxing statute, the charging section has to be construed strictly, but the 
machinery provisions must be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary 
rules of statutory interpretation.81 The purpose is to give effect to the clear 
intention of the legislature. In Murarilal Mahabir Prasad v. B R Vad,82 this 
Court held that: 
“29. […] There is no equity about a tax in the sense 
that a provision by which a tax is imposed has to be 
construed strictly, regardless of the hardship that 
such a construction may cause either to the treasury 
or to the taxpayer. If the subject falls squarely within 
the letter of law he must be taxed, howsoever 
inequitable the consequences may appear to the 
judicial mind. If the Revenue seeking to tax cannot 
bring the subject within the letter of law, the subject 
is free no matter that such a construction may cause 
serious prejudice to the Revenue. In other words, 
though what is called equitable construction may be 
admissible in relation to other statutes or other 
provisions of a taxing statute, such a construction is

not admissible in the interpretation of a charging or 
taxing provision of a taxing statute.” 
37. A statute is designed to be workable. A statutory provision must be construed 
in a manner to make it workable to achieve the purpose of the legislation.83 A 
construction that fails to achieve the manifest purpose of legislation or 
reduces the statutory provisions to futility should be avoided.84 The machinery 
provisions must be construed to effectuate the object and purpose of a statute 
and not defeat them. In J K Synthetics Ltd. v. CTO,85 a Constitution Bench 
of this Court observed: 
“16. It is well-known that when a statute levies a tax 
it does so by inserting a charging section by which a 
liability is created or fixed and then proceeds to 
provide the machinery to make the liability effective. 
It, therefore, provides the machinery for the 
assessment of the liability already fixed by the 
charging section, and then provides the mode for the 
recovery and collection of tax, including penal 
provisions meant to deal with defaulters. Provision is 
also made for charging interest on delayed 
payments, etc. Ordinarily the charging section 
which fixes the liability is strictly construed but 
that rule of strict construction is not extended to 
the machinery provisions which are construed 
like any other statute. The machinery provisions 
must, no doubt, be so construed as would 
effectuate the object and purpose of the statute 
and not defeat the same.”

85 (1994) 

PART D 

38. The provisions in a taxing statute dealing with machinery for assessment have 
to be construed in accordance with the intention of the legislature to make the 
charge levied effective.86 While interpreting provisions that set up the 
machinery of assessment, the rule is that construction should be preferred 
which makes the machinery workable87 and furthers the intention of the 
legislature.88 In CIT v. Sun Engineering Works (P) Ltd.,89 a two-Judge 
Bench of this Court observed that the provision dealing with reassessment 
contained in Section 147 of the Income Tax Act was for the benefit of the 
Revenue: 
“40. Although, Section 147 is part of a taxing statute, 
it imposes no charge on the subject but deals merely 
with the machinery of assessment and in interpreting 
a provision of that kind, the rule is that construction 
should be preferred which makes the machinery 
workable. Since the proceedings under Section 147 
of the Act are for the benefit of the Revenue and not 
an assessee and are aimed at gathering the 
‘escaped income’ of an assessee, the same cannot 
be allowed to be converted as ‘revisional’ or ‘review’ 
proceedings at the instance of the assessee, thereby 
making the machinery unworkable.” 
iv. 
Principle of harmonious construction 
39. The legislature is presumed to enact a consistent and harmonious body of 
laws in deference to the rule of law.90 In case of any apparent conflict within 
a provision or between two provisions of the same statute, the courts must 
read the provisions harmoniously.91 The principle of harmonious construction

91 Sultana Begum v. Prem Chand Jain, (1997) [15] 

PART D 

requires courts to bring about a reconciliation between seemingly conflicting 
provisions to give effect to both. An interpretation which reduces one of the 
provisions to a “dead letter” is not a harmonious construction. The principle of 
harmonious construction also applies to reconcile two seemingly conflicting 
provisions of different statutes.92 
40. A legislature often appends a non obstante clause to a provision to give it an 
overriding effect over provisions contained in the same statute or a separate 
statute.93 The purpose of incorporating a non obstante clause in a provision 
is to prohibit the operation and effect of all contrary provisions.94 In 
Chadavarkar Sita Ratna Rao v. Ashalata S Guram,95 Justice Sabyasachi 
Mukharji (as the learned Chief Justice then was) explained the purpose of a 
non obstante clause thus: 
“67. A clause beginning with the expression 
“notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in 
some particular provision in the Act or in some 
particular Act or in any law for the time being in force, 
or in any contract” is more often than not appended 
to a section in the beginning with a view to give the 
enacting part of the section in case of conflict an 
overriding effect over the provision of the Act or the 
contract mentioned in the non obstante clause. It is 
equivalent to saying that in spite of the provision of 
the Act or any other Act mentioned in the non 
obstante clause or any contract or document 
mentioned the enactment following it will have its full 
operation or that the provisions embraced in the non 
obstante clause would not be an impediment for an 
operation of the enactment.”

PART D 

41. A non-obstante clause must be given effect to the extent Parliament intended 
and not beyond.96 In construing a provision containing a non obstante clause, 
courts must determine the purpose and object for which the provision was 
enacted.97 The courts are also required to find out the extent to which the 
legislature intended to give one provision overriding effect over another 
provision.98 In case of a clear inconsistency between two enactments, a 
provision containing a non obstante clause can be given an overriding effect 
over a provision contained in another statute. 
42. Another principle of interpretation is that when two laws are inconsistent or 
repugnant, the later legislation is interpreted as having impliedly repealed the 
earlier legislation. The principle underlying implied repeal is that there is no 
need for the later enactment to state in express words that the earlier 
enactment has been repealed if the legislative intent to supersede the earlier 
law is manifested through the provisions of the later enactment.99 In MCD v. 
Shiv Shanker,100 this Court culled out the following principles applicable to 
the implied repeal of legislation: 
a. A subsequent legislation may not be too readily presumed to effectuate a 
repeal of existing statutory laws in the absence of express or at least 
unambiguous indication to that effect; 
b. Courts must lean against implying a repeal unless the two provisions are so 
plainly repugnant to each other that they cannot stand together and it is not

possible on any reasonable hypothesis to give effect to both at the same 
time; 
c. It is necessary to closely scrutinise and consider the true meaning and effect 
of both the earlier and the later statute; and 
d. If the objects of the two statutory provisions are different and the language 
of each statute is restricted to its objects or subject, then they are generally 
intended to rule in parallel lines without meeting and there would be no real 
conflict. 
43. The principle on which the rule of implied repeal rests is that if the subject-
matter of a later legislation is identical to that of an earlier legislation so that 
they both cannot stand together, then the earlier legislation is impliedly 
repealed by the later legislation.101 The courts have to determine whether the 
legislature intended the two sets of provisions to be applied simultaneously.102 
The presumption against implied repeal is based on the theory that the 
legislature knows the existing laws and does not intend to create any 
confusion by retaining two conflicting provisions or statutes.103 The test to be 
applied for the construction of implied repeal is whether the new or 
subsequent law is inconsistent with or repugnant to the old law. The 
inconsistency or repugnancy should clearly and manifestly reveal an intention 
to repeal the existing laws.104 The inconsistency or repugnancy must be such 
that the two statutes cannot be reconciled on reasonable construction or

hypothesis. To determine whether a later statute repeals by implication an 
earlier statute, it is necessary to examine the scope and object of the two 
enactments by comparison of their provisions.105 Implied repeal should be 
avoided, if possible, where both the statutes can stand together.106

background discussed above. 
E. 
Reading TOLA into the Income Tax Act 
i. 
First proviso to Section 149(1) of the new regime 
45. The first proviso to Section 149(1)(b) provides thus: 
“149. (1) No notice under section 148 shall be issued 
for the relevant assessment year, - 
(a) If three years have elapsed from the end of the 
relevant assessment year, unless the case falls 
under clause (b); 
(b) If three years, but not more than ten years, have 
elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment 
year unless the Assessing Officer has in 
possession of books of account or other 
documents or evidence which reveal that the 
income chargeable to tax, represented in the 
form of asset, which has escaped assessment 
amounts to or is likely to amount to fifty lakh 
rupees or more for that year: 
Provided that no notice under section 148 shall 
be issued at any time in a case for the relevant 
assessment year beginning on or before 1st day 
of April 2021, if such notice could not have been 
issued at that time on account of being

immediately beyond the time limit specified 
under the provisions of clause (b) of sub-section 
(1) of this section, as they stood immediately 
before the commencement of the Finance Act, 
2021:” 
(emphasis supplied) 
46. The ingredients of the proviso could be broken down for analysis as follows: 
(i) no notice under Section 148 of the new regime can be issued at any time 
for an assessment year beginning on or before 1 April 2021; (ii) if it is barred 
at the time when the notice is sought to be issued because of the “time limits 
specified under the provisions of” 149(1)(b) of the old regime. Thus, a notice 
could be issued under Section 148 of the new regime for assessment year 
2021-2022 and before only if the time limit for issuance of such notice 
continued to exist under Section 149(1)(b) of the old regime. 
47. In CTO v. Biswanath Jhunjhunwalla,107 the Bengal Sales Tax Rules 1941 
empowered the Commissioner to revise any assessment within four years 
from the date of assessment. Subsequently, the State Government issued a 
notification following the law to extend the time limit from four years to six 
years from the date of assessment. The extension of the time limit was 
challenged by the respondents on the ground that the assessments which 
had attained finality because of the expiry of the period of four years could 
not be reassessed. This Court observed that it was the clear intention of the 
notification to permit the Commissioner to revise any assessment made or 
order passed, provided the assessment had not been made before six years. 
 
107 (1996) 

PART E 

It was held that if the legislative intention is clear and the language is 
unambiguous, full effect must be given to the legislative intention by reading 
the notification as applying not only to the incomplete assessments but also 
to assessments that had reached finality because of lapse of the earlier 
prescribed 
period. The 
principle 
that 
emanates 
from 
Biswanath 
Jhunjhunwalla (supra) is that the courts should give full effect to the 
legislative intention of granting reassessment powers to assessing officers 
unless the legislature, by express provision, states otherwise. 
48. Notices have to be judged according to the law existing on the date the notice 
is issued. Section 149 of the old regime primarily provided two time limits: (i) 
four years for all situations and (ii) beyond four years and within six years if 
the income chargeable to tax which escaped assessment amounted to 
Rupees one lakh or more. After 1 April 2021, the time limits prescribed under 
the new regime came into force. The ordinary time limit of four years was 
reduced to three years. Therefore, in all situations, reassessment notices 
could be issued under the new regime if not more than three years have 
elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment year. For example, for 
assessment year 2018-2019, the four year period would have expired on 31 
March 2023 under the old regime. However, if the notice is issued after 1 April 
2021, the three year time limit prescribed under the new regime will be 
applicable. The three year time limit will expire on 31 March 2022. 
49. The first proviso to Section 149(1)(b) requires the determination of whether 
the time limit prescribed under Section 149(1)(b) of the old regime continues 
to exist for the assessment year 2021-2022 and before. Resultantly, a notice 

PART E 

under Section 148 of the new regime cannot be issued if the period of six 
years from the end of the relevant assessment year has expired at the time 
of issuance of the notice. This also ensures that the new time limit of ten years 
prescribed under Section 149(1)(b) of the new regime applies prospectively. 
For example, for the assessment year 2012-2013, the ten year period would 
have expired on 31 March 2023, while the six year period expired on 31 March 
2019. Without the proviso to Section 149(1)(b) of the new regime, the 
Revenue could have had the power to reopen assessments for the year 2012-
2013 if the escaped assessment amounted to Rupees fifty lakhs or more. The 
proviso limits the retrospective operation of Section 149(1)(b) to protect the 
interests of the assesses. 
50. Another important change under Section 149(1)(b) of the new regime is the 
increase in the monetary threshold from Rupees one lakh to Rupees fifty 
lakhs. The old regime prescribed a time limit of six years from the end of the 
relevant assessment year if the income chargeable to tax which escaped 
assessment was more than Rupees one lakh. In comparison, the new regime 
increases the time limit to ten years if the escaped assessment amounts to 
more than Rupees fifty lakhs. This change could be summarized thus: 
Regime 
Time limit 
Income chargeable to 
tax which has 
escaped assessment 
Old regime 
Four years but not 
more than six years 
Rupees one lakh or 
more 
New regime 
Three years but not 
more than ten years 
Rupees fifty lakhs or 
more 

PART E 

51. Given Section 149(1)(b) of the new regime, reassessment notices could be 
issued after three years only if the income chargeable to tax which escaped 
assessment is more than Rupees fifty lakhs. The proviso to Section 149(1)(b) 
limits the retrospectivity of that provision with respect to the time limits 
specified under Section 149(1)(b) of the old regime. 
52. In Ashish Agarwal (supra), this Court held that the benefit of the new regime 
must be provided for the reassessment conducted for the past periods. The 
increase of the monetary threshold from Rupees one lakh to Rupees fifty lakh 
is beneficial for the assesses. Mr Venkataraman has also conceded on behalf 
of the Revenue that all notices issued under the new regime by invoking the 
six year time limit prescribed under Section 149(1)(b) of the old regime will 
have to be dropped if the income chargeable to tax which has escaped 
assessment is less than Rupees fifty lakhs. 
53. The position of law which can be derived based on the above discussion may 
be summarized thus: (i) Section 149(1) of the new regime is not prospective. 
It also applies to past assessment years; (ii) The time limit of four years is 
now reduced to three years for all situations. The Revenue can issue notices 
under Section 148 of the new regime only if three years or less have elapsed 
from the end of the relevant assessment year; (iii) the proviso to Section 
149(1)(b) of the new regime stipulates that the Revenue can issue 
reassessment notices for past assessment years only if the time limit survives 
according to Section 149(1)(b) of the old regime, that is, six years from the 
end of the relevant assessment year; and (iv) all notices issued invoking the 
time limit under Section 149(1)(b) of the old regime will have to be dropped if 

PART E 

the income chargeable to tax which has escaped assessment is less than 
Rupees fifty lakhs. ii. 
TOLA can extend the time limit till 31 June 2021 
54. The proviso to Section 149(1)(b) of the new regime uses the expression 
“beyond the time limit specified under the provisions of clause (b) of sub-
section (1) of this section, as they stood immediately before the 
commencement of the Finance Act, 2021.” Thus, the proviso specifically 
refers to the time limits specified under Section 149(1)(b) of the old regime. 
The Revenue accepts that without application of TOLA, the time limit for 
issuance of reassessment notices after 1 April 2021 expires for assessment 
years 2013-2014, 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 in the 
following manner: 

for the assessment years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, the six year 
period expires on 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2021 respectively; and 

for the assessment years 2016-2017 and 2017-2018, the three year 
period expires on 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2021 respectively. a. Finance Act 2021 substituted the old regime 
55. In Shamrao V Parulekar v. District Magistrate, Thana,108 a Constitution 
Bench of this Court was called upon to decide the validity of the detention of 
the petitioner under the Preventive Detention Amendment Act 1950.109 The 
Detention Act 1950 was due to expire on 1 April 1951, but the legislation was 
 
108 (1952) 
109 “Detention Act 1950” 

PART E 

amended to prolong its life by another year till 1 April 1952. The petitioner was 
detained on 15 November 1951 and his detention would have expired on 1 
April 1952 with the expiration of the enactment. However, the Detention Act 
1950 was amended in 1952, further prolonging its application for six months 
till 1 October 1952. The issue before this Court was whether the prolonging 
of the Detention Act 1950 also prolonged the detention of the petitioner. 
56. Justice Vivian Bose, writing for the Constitution Bench, held that the detention 
continued until the expiry of the Detention Act 1950 on 1 October 1952. The 
learned Judge further observed: 
“7. The rule is that when a subsequent Act amends 
an earlier one in such a way as to incorporate itself, 
or a part of itself, into the earlier, then the earlier Act 
must thereafter be read and construed (except 
where 
that 
would 
lead 
to 
a 
repugnancy, 
inconsistency or absurdity) as if the altered words 
had been written into the earlier Act with pen and ink 
and the old words scored out so that thereafter there 
is no need to refer to the amending Act at all. […] 
Bearing this in mind it will be seen that the 1950 
Act remains the 1950 Act all the way through 
even 
with 
its 
subsequent 
amendments. 
Therefore, the moment the 1952 Act was passed 
and Section 2 came into operation, the Act of 
1950 meant the 1950 Act as amended by Section 
2, that is to say, the 1950 Act now due to expire 
on 1-10-1952.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
The principle which emanates from Shamrao V Parulekar (supra) is that after 
an amendment, the legislation has to be read along with the amended 
provisions. 

PART E 

57. The legislative practice of amendment by substitution is often used by the 
legislatures. The process of substitution of a statutory provision generally 
involves two steps: first, the existing rule is deleted; and second, the new rule 
is brought into existence in its place.110 The deletion effectively repeals the 
existing provision.111 Thus, an amendment by substitution results in the repeal 
of an earlier provision and its replacement by a new provision.112 The 
repealed provision will cease to operate from the date of repeal and the 
substituted provision will commence operation from the date of its 
substitution.113 After the substitution, the legislation must be read and 
construed as if the altered words have been written into the legislation “with 
pen and ink and the old words scored out.”114 Therefore, after amendment by 
substitution any reference to a legislation must be construed as the legislation 
as amended by substitution. 
58. In Shyam Sunder v. Ram Kumar,115 a Constitution Bench of this Court was 
called upon to decide the extent of retrospective operation of an amendment 
by substitution. In that case, the Haryana Amendment Act 1995 substituted 
Section 15 of the Punjab Pre-emption Act by taking away the right of a co-
sharer to pre-empt a sale during the pendency of an appeal. This Court

114 G V Krishnamraju v. Union of India, (2019) [18]; Ram Narain v. Simla Banking & Industrial 
Co. Ltd,. [It was observed: 7. […] whenever an amended Act has to be applied 
subsequent to the date of the amendment the various unamended provisions of the Act have to be read 
along with the amended provisions as though they are part of it. This is for the purpose of determining what 
the meaning of any particular provision of the Act as amended is, whether it is in the unamended part or in 
the amended part. But this is the not the same thing as saying that the amendment itself must be taken to 
have been in existence as from the date of the earlier Act. That would be imputing to the amendment 
retrospective operation which could only be done if such retrospective operation is given by the amending 
Act either expressly or by necessary implication.”] 
115 (2001) 

PART E 

observed that according to Order 20 Rule 14(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure 
1908, the right of pre-emption becomes a vested right and can only be taken 
away by a known method of law. As regards the retrospective operation of a 
substituted provision, it was held that “where a repeal of provisions of 
enactment is followed by fresh legislation by an amending Act, such 
legislation is prospective in operation and does not affect substantive or 
vested rights of the parties unless made retrospective either expressly or by 
necessary intendment.”116 This Court held that the language used by the 
legislature indicated that it was introduced with prospective effect and could 
not affect the accrued rights of the co-sharers. The decision of this Court in 
Shyam Sunder (supra) is an authority for the proposition that an amendment 
by substitution can have a retrospective effect and affect the vested rights of 
the parties if the provision is made retrospective either expressly or by 
necessary intendment. 
59. Parliament has often used the legislative process of amendment by 
substitution in the context of reassessment provisions under the Income Tax 
Act. In S C Prashar v. Vasantsen Dwarkadas,117 a Constitution Bench of this 
Court had to decide on the validity of the notices issued under Section 34 of 
the Income Tax Act 1922. In 1948, Section 34 of the Income Tax Act 1922 was 
substituted by a new provision which provided the following time limits: (i) 
eight years from the end of the year if there was omission or failure on the 
part of an assessee to make a return or disclose fully and truly all material 
 
116 Shyam Sunder (supra) [28] 
117 (1964) 

PART E 

facts necessary for assessment; and (ii) four years for all other cases. Justice 
M Hidayatullah (as the learned Chief Justice then was), writing for himself and 
Justice Raghubar Dayal, observed that the substituted provision was meant 
to enable the reassessment of income which had escaped assessment for 
past periods. It was further observed that the substituted provision “meant to 
operate retrospectively eight years in some cases and four years in others.”118 
Justice A K Sarkar (as the learned Chief Justice then was) also observed that 
no notice could be issued under the 1948 amendment “for a year from the 
end of which eight years had expired.”119 
60. The above principles can be applied as follows to the factual situation in the 
present appeals: (i) The Finance Act 2021 substituted Sections 147 to 151 of 
the Income Tax Act with effect from 1 April 2021; (ii) Sections 147 to 151 of 
the old law ceased to operate from 1 April 2021; (iii) After 1 April 2021, any 
reference to the Income Tax Act means the Income Tax Act as amended by 
the Finance Act 2021; (iv) The time limits prescribed for issuing reassessment 
notices under Section 149 operate retrospectively for three years for all 
situations and six years in case the escaped assessment amounts to or is 
likely to amount to more than Rupees fifty lakhs. 
61. TOLA is a legislation enacted by Parliament. The assesses have neither 
challenged the legislative competence of Parliament to enact TOLA nor have 
they challenged the vires of the legislation. Section 3(1) of TOLA provides for 
the relaxation of “any time limit” prescribed under the specified Acts for

completion or compliance of “any proceeding or passing of any order or 
issuance of any sanction, intimation, notification, sanction, or approval.” The 
expression “any” has been interpreted by this Court to mean “all” or “every”.120 
The context in which the word “any” appears has to be construed after taking 
into consideration the scheme and the purpose of the enactment.121 
62. The purpose of Section 3(1) of TOLA is to provide relaxation of time limits 
prescribed under the specified Acts, which fell for completion or compliance 
from 20 March 2020 to 31 March 2021. TOLA was enacted in the backdrop 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, which impeded the functioning of the government 
at all levels. The imposition of national and local lockdowns created difficulties 
for the common people, including litigants and assesses, to comply with their 
legal obligations. The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns 
required legislatures across the world to dynamically adapt their laws and 
policies to redress the difficulties faced by persons, entities, and 
governmental authorities.122 The World Bank identified that persons and 
business entities faced severe financial situations characterised by a lack of 
cash or easily convertible-to-cash assets. It suggested that this would impact 
revenue collection because individuals and entities would not be in a position 
to pay the assessed taxes. Therefore, the World Bank advised deferral of tax 
filings and payment deadlines to allow individuals and business entities to

PART E 

cope with the crisis.123 Many countries across the world have extended 
deadlines for filing tax returns.124 
63. TOLA extended the time limits for completion or compliance of certain actions 
under the specified Act, which fell for completion during the COVID-19 
outbreak. The use of the expression “any” in Section 3(1) indicates that the 
relaxation applies to “all” or “every” action whose time limit falls for completion 
from 20 March 2020 to 31 March 2021. Section 3(1) is only concerned with 
the performance of actions contemplated under the provisions of the specified 
Acts. Consequently, the amendment or substitution of a provision under the 
specified Acts will not affect the application of TOLA, so long as the action 
contemplated under the provision falls for completion during the period 
specified by TOLA, that is, 20 March 2020 to 31 March 2021. 
64. When enacting a statute, the legislature often endeavours to ensure that the 
provisions of one legislation do not conflict with provisions of another 
legislation.125 The purpose of the Income Tax Act is to levy tax on income and 
raise revenues for the functioning of the Government. On the other hand, the 
purpose of TOLA is to provide relaxation of the time for completion of any 
actions or proceedings falling for completion within a particular period. Thus, 
the two enactments operate in separate and distinct fields. This Court must

PART E 

ensure that the provisions of the two enactments are interpreted 
harmoniously unless there is an irreconcilable conflict between them. b. 
Reading TOLA into Section 149 
65. Section 3(1) of TOLA applies to the action of “issuance of any notice” under 
the Income Tax Act. The relaxation provided under Section 3(1) of TOLA will 
apply to the issuance of a reassessment notice under Section 148 of the 
Income Tax Act. TOLA did not amend the time limits of four years and six 
years from the end of the relevant assessment years as specified under the 
Income Tax Act. It merely provided a relaxation of the time period for issuance 
of a reassessment notice under Section 148. TOLA has no application in 
situations where the time limit specified under Section 149 expired before 20 
March 2020. The effect of TOLA is that at the time of issuance of a 
reassessment notice under Section 148, the Revenue has to determine two 
things: (i) the time limit specified under Section 149; and (ii) the extent of 
relaxation provided by TOLA and its notifications for issuance of notices. 
Thus, although TOLA did not amend Section 149 of the Income Tax Act, it has 
to be read with Section 149 to determine the time limit for issuance of a notice. 
This was the legislative intent behind the enactment of TOLA. For instance, 
the six year time limit for assessment year 2013-2014 under Section 149(1)(b) 
of the old regime expired on 31 March 2020. TOLA extended the period for 
issuing notice until 30 June 2021, given the difficulties that arose because of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 
66. Section 3(1) of TOLA allowed the Central Government to specify by 
notification “such other date after the 31st day of March, 2021” as the time limit 

PART E 

for completion or compliance of any action under the specified Acts. The 
provision also empowered the Central Government to specify different dates 
for completion or compliance of different actions. The notifications dated 31 
March 2021 and 27 April 2021 extend the operation of TOLA by providing an 
extended time limit for completing actions under the Income Tax Act till 30 
June 2021. 
67. Section 2(1)(b)(ii) of TOLA defines ‘specified Act’ to include the Income Tax 
Act. After 1 April 2021, Section 2(1)(b)(ii) must be read to mean the Income 
Tax Act as amended by the Finance Act 2021. The substitution of Sections 
147 to 151 will not affect the purpose of TOLA, which is, to provide relaxation 
of the time limit for completion or compliance of any actions falling for 
completion between 20 March 2020 and 31 March 2021. TOLA will continue 
to apply to the Income Tax Act after 1 April 2021 if any action or proceeding 
specified under the substituted provisions of the Income Tax Act falls for 
completion between 20 March 2020 and 31 March 2021. 
68. After 1 April 2021, the Income Tax Act has to be read along with the 
substituted provisions. The substituted provisions apply retrospectively for 
past assessment years as well. On 1 April 2021, TOLA was still in existence, 
and the Revenue could not have ignored the application of TOLA and its 
notifications. Therefore, for issuing a reassessment notice under Section 148 
after 1 April 2021, the Revenue would still have to look at: (i) the time limit 
specified under Section 149 of the new regime; and (ii) the time limit for 
issuance of notice as extended by TOLA and its notifications. The Revenue 
cannot extend the operation of the old law under TOLA, but it can certainly 

PART E 

benefit from the extended time limit for completion of actions falling for 
completion between 20 March 2020 and 31 March 2021. 
69. For instance, Section 149(1)(a) of the new regime specified the time limit of 
three years from the end of the relevant assessment year for reopening of the 
assessment. For assessment year 2017-2018, the three year period expired 
on 31 March 2021. The expiry of time fell within the time period contemplated 
by Section 3 of TOLA read with its notifications. Resultantly, the Revenue had 
time until 30 June 2021 to issue a reassessment notice for assessment year 
2017-2018 under Section 149(1)(a). This harmonious reading gives effect to 
the legislative intention of both the Income Tax Act and TOLA. Moreover, 
Sections 147 to 151 are machinery provisions. Therefore, they must be given 
an interpretation that is consistent with the object and purpose of the Income 
Tax Act. 
70. In Income-tax Officer v. Vikram Sujitkumar Bhatia,126 a two-Judge Bench 
of this Court had to decide whether Section 153C of the Income Tax Act, as 
amended by the Finance Act 2015, would apply to searches conducted before 
1 June 2015 (the date of coming into force of the amendment). This Court 
observed that since Section 153C is a machinery provision, it should be 
interpreted in a manner to effectuate the object and purpose of the statute. It 
was observed that the object and purpose of Section 153C was the 
assessment of the income of any other person. It was held that if the amended 
 
126 (2023) 453 ITR 417 

PART E 

provision is made applicable prospectively, it will frustrate the object and 
purpose of Section 153C. 
71. Section 3(1) of TOLA contains a non obstante clause: “notwithstanding 
anything contained in the specified Act.” The legislative intention of including 
the non obstante clause is to remove any obstacles which may come in the 
way of the operation of the extension of the time limit till 31 March 2021 or 
such other date after 31 March 2021 specified by the Central Government. 
The purpose is to ensure that the full benefit of the relaxation should be 
provided to both the assesses and the Revenue to tide over the difficulties 
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
72. The non obstante clause in Section 3(1) has to be read as controlling the 
provisions of the specified Acts, including the provisions of the Income Tax 
Act.127 In the context of the issuance of a reassessment notice, the non 
obstante clause will override the provisions of the Income Tax Act in case of 
any direct conflict or inconsistency. Section 3(1) overrides Section 149 only 
to the extent of relaxing the time limit for issuance of reassessment notice 
under Section 148. The time limit for issuance of a reassessment notices, 
which fall for completion between 20 March 2020 and 31 March 2021, has 
been extended till 30 June 2021. However, the non obstante clause under 
Section 3(1) of TOLA will operate neither to extend the time limit of three years 
from the end of the relevant assessment year under Section 149(1)(a) of the 
new regime nor to extend the time limit of six years from the end of the 
relevant assessment years under Section 149(1)(b) of the old regime. The 
 
127 M P V Sundararamier v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 

PART E 

non obstante clause ensures that the Revenue has additional time beyond 
the statutory stipulated time limit to complete or comply with the formalities 
given the administrative difficulties that arose due to the COVID-19 pandemic. iii. 
Sanction of the specified authority 
73. Section 151 imposes a check upon the power of the Revenue to reopen 
assessments. The provision imposes a responsibility on the Revenue to 
ensure that it obtains the sanction of the specified authority before issuing a 
notice under Section 148. The purpose behind this procedural check is to 
save the assesses from harassment resulting from the mechanical reopening 
of assessments.128 A table representing the prescription under the old and 
new regime is set out below:

PART E 

74. The above table indicates that the specified authority is directly co-related to 
the time when the notice is issued. This plays out as follows under the old 
regime: 

If income escaping assessment was less than Rupees one lakh: (a) a 
reassessment notice could be issued under Section 148 within four 
years after obtaining the approval of the Joint Commissioner; and (b) 
no notice could be issued after the expiry of four years; and 

If income escaping was more than Rupees one lakh: (a) a 
reassessment notice could be issued within four years after obtaining 
the approval of the Joint Commissioner; and (b) after four years but 
within six years after obtaining the approval of the Principal Chief 
Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal Commissioner or 
Commissioner. 
75. After 1 April 2021, the new regime has specified different authorities for 
granting sanctions under Section 151. The new regime is beneficial to the 
assesse because it specifies a higher level of authority for the grant of 
sanctions in comparison to the old regime. Therefore, in terms of Ashish 
Agarwal (supra), after 1 April 2021, the prior approval must be obtained from 
the appropriate authorities specified under Section 151 of the new regime. 
The effect of Section 151 of the new regime is thus: 

If income escaping assessment is less than Rupees fifty lakhs: (a) a 
reassessment notice could be issued within three years after obtaining 

PART E 

the prior approval of the Principal Commissioner, or Principal Director or 
Commissioner or Director; and (b) no notice could be issued after the 
expiry of three years; and 

If income escaping assessment is more than Rupees fifty lakhs: (a) a 
reassessment notice could be issued within three years after obtaining 
the prior approval of the Principal Commissioner, or Principal Director or 
Commissioner or Director; and (b) after three years after obtaining the 
prior approval of the Principal Chief Commissioner or Principal Director 
General or Chief Commissioner or Director General. 
76. Grant of sanction by the appropriate authority is a precondition for the 
assessing officer to assume jurisdiction under Section 148 to issue a 
reassessment notice. Section 151 of the new regime does not prescribe a 
time limit within which a specified authority has to grant sanction. Rather, it 
links up the time limits with the jurisdiction of the authority to grant sanction. 
Section 151(ii) of the new regime prescribes a higher level of authority if more 
than three years have elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment year. 
Thus, non-compliance by the assessing officer with the strict time limits 
prescribed under Section 151 affects their jurisdiction to issue a notice under 
Section 148. 
77. Parliament enacted TOLA to ensure that the interests of the Revenue are not 
defeated because the assessing officer could not comply with the pre-
conditions due to the difficulties that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Section 3(1) of TOLA relaxes the time limit for compliance with actions that 
fall for completion from 20 March 2020 to 31 March 2021. TOLA will 

PART E 

accordingly extend the time limit for the grant of sanction by the authority 
specified under Section 151. The test to determine whether TOLA will apply 
to Section 151 of the new regime is this: if the time limit of three years from 
the end of an assessment year falls between 20 March 2020 and 31 March 
2021, then the specified authority under Section 151(i) has an extended time 
till 30 June 2021 to grant approval. In the case of Section 151 of the old 
regime, the test is: if the time limit of four years from the end of an assessment 
year falls between 20 March 2020 and 31 March 2021, then the specified 
authority under Section 151(2) has time till 31 March 2021 to grant approval. 
The time limit for Section 151 of the old regime expires on 31 March 2021 
because the new regime comes into effect on 1 April 2021. 
78. For example, the three year time limit for assessment year 2017-2018 falls 
for completion on 31 March 2021. It falls during the time period of 20 March 
2020 and 31 March 2021, contemplated under Section 3(1) of TOLA. 
Resultantly, the authority specified under Section 151(i) of the new regime 
can grant sanction till 30 June 2021. 
79. Under Finance Act 2021, the assessing officer was required to obtain prior 
approval or sanction of the specified authorities at four stages: 
a. Section 148A(a) – to conduct any enquiry, if required, with respect to the 
information which suggests that the income chargeable to tax has escaped 
assessment; 
b. Section 148A(b) – to provide an opportunity of hearing to the assessee by 
serving upon them a show cause notice as to why a notice under Section 
148 should not be issued based on the information that suggests that 

PART E 

income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment. It must be noted that 
this requirement has been deleted by the Finance Act 2022;129 
c. Section 148A(d) – to pass an order deciding whether or not it is a fit case for 
issuing a notice under Section 148; and 
d. Section 148 – to issue a reassessment notice. 
80. In Ashish Agarwal (supra), this Court directed that Section 148 notices which 
were challenged before various High Courts “shall be deemed to have been 
issued under Section 148-A of the Income Tax Act as substituted by the 
Finance Act, 2021 and construed or treated to be show-cause notices in terms 
of Section 148-A(b).” Further, this Court dispensed with the requirement of 
conducting any enquiry with the prior approval of the specified authority under 
Section 148A(a). Under Section 148A(b), an assessing officer was required 
to obtain prior approval from the specified authority before issuing a show 
cause notice. When this Court deemed the Section 148 notices under the old 
regime as Section 148A(b) notices under the new regime, it impliedly waived 
the requirement of obtaining prior approval from the specified authorities 
under Section 151 for Section 148A(b). It is well established that this Court 
while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 142, is not bound by the 
procedural requirements of law.130 
81. This Court in Ashish Agarwal (supra) directed the assessing officers to “pass 
orders in terms of Section 148-A(d) in respect of each of the assesses 
concerned.” Further, it directed the assessing officers to issue a notice under 
 
129 Section 45, Finance Act 2022 
130 Allahabad High Court Bar Association v. State of U P, (2024) [27.3] 

PART F 

Section 148 of the new regime “after following the procedure as required 
under Section 148-A.” Although this Court waived off the requirement of 
obtaining prior approval under Section 148A(a) and Section 148A(b), it did 
not waive the requirement for Section 148A(d) and Section 148. Therefore, 
the assessing officer was required to obtain prior approval of the specified 
authority according to Section 151 of the new regime before passing an order 
under Section 148A(d) or issuing a notice under Section 148. These notices 
ought to have been issued following the time limits specified under Section 
151 of the new regime read with TOLA, where applicable.

Scope of Article 142 
82. Article 142 empowers this Court to pass such decree or make such order as 
is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before 
it.131 The discretionary jurisdiction exercised by this Court under Article 142 is 
of the widest amplitude.132 The Constitution has left it to the judicial discretion 
of this Court to decide the scope and limits of its jurisdiction to render 
substantial justice in matters coming before it.133 The expression “any cause 
or matter” mentioned under Article 142 includes every kind of proceeding 
pending before this Court.134 Article 142 allows this Court to give precedence 
 
131 Article 142, Constitution. [It reads: 
“142(1) The Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree or make such order as 
is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it, and any decree so passed 
or order so made shall be enforceable throughout the territory of India in such manner as may be prescribed 
by or under any law made by Parliament and, until provision in that behalf is so made, in such manner as 
President may by order prescribe.”

to equity over law, provided the exercise of the discretion is consistent with 
constitutional provisions and after due consideration of substantive provisions 
in statutory law.135 
83. In Prem Chand Garg v. The Excise Commissioner,136 Justice P B 
Gajendragadkar (as the learned Chief Justice then was), speaking for the 
majority, observed that the order made by this Court under Article 142 “must 
not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the 
Constitution, but it cannot even be inconsistent with the substantive 
provisions of the relevant statutory laws.” However, in Union Carbide Corpn. 
Ltd. v. Union of India,137 Justice Venkatachaliah (as the learned Chief Justice 
then was), speaking for the majority, clarified Prem Chand Garg (supra) by 
observing that ordinary laws cannot limit the constitutional powers of this 
Court under Article 142. The learned Judge further observed that in exercising 
its jurisdiction under Article 142, this Court will “take note of the express 
prohibitions in any substantive statutory provision based on some 
fundamental principles of public policy and regulate the exercise of its power 
and discretion accordingly.” 
84. In Supreme Court Bar Association v. Union of India,138 a Constitution 
Bench held that the powers under Article 142 cannot be exercised to supplant 
 
135 Shilpa Sailesh v. Varun Sreenivasan, [12] 

137 (1991) [83] 
138 (1998) [47. […] It, however, needs to be remembered that the powers conferred on the Court 
by Article 142 being curative in nature cannot be construed as powers which authorise the Court to ignore the 
substantive rights of a litigant while dealing with a cause pending before it. This power cannot be used to 
“supplant” substantive law applicable to the case or cause under consideration of the Court. Article 142, even 
with the width of its amplitude, cannot be used to build a new edifice where none existed earlier, by ignoring 
express statutory provisions dealing with a subject and thereby to achieve something indirectly which cannot 
be achieved directly.] 

PART F 

substantive law applicable to the matter pending before this Court. In 
Allahabad High Court Bar Association v. State of Uttar Pradesh,139 a 
Constitution Bench laid down the following parameters for the exercise of the 
jurisdiction under Article 142: 
“27.1. The jurisdiction can be exercised to do 
complete justice between the parties before the 
Court. It cannot be exercised to nullify the benefits 
derived by a large number of litigants based on 
judicial orders validly passed in their favour who are 
not parties to the proceedings before this Court; 
27.2. Article 142 does not empower this Court to 
ignore the substantive rights of the litigants; and 
27.3. While exercising the jurisdiction under Article 
142 of the Constitution of India, this Court can 
always issue procedural directions to the courts for 
streamlining procedural aspects and ironing out the 
creases in the procedural laws to ensure expeditious 
and timely disposal of cases. This is because, 
while exercising the jurisdiction under Article 
142, this Court may not be bound by procedural 
requirements of law. However, while doing so, 
this Court cannot affect the substantive rights of 
those litigants who are not parties to the case 
before it. The right to be heard before an adverse 
order is passed is not a matter of procedure but 
a substantive right.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
85. In M Siddiq v. Suresh Das,140 a Constitution Bench observed that Article 142 
embodies the concept of justice, equity, and good conscience. This Court 
 
139 (2024) 
140 (2020) [1023] 

PART F 

further observed that Article 142 empowers the court to pass an order which 
accords with justice: 
“1026. The extraordinary constitutional power to 
pass any decree or an order which, in the opinion of 
this Court is necessary for doing complete justice 
embodies the idea that a court must, by necessity, 
be empowered to craft outcomes that ensure a just 
outcome. When a court is presented before it 
with hard cases, they follow an interpretation of 
the law that best fits and justifies the existing 
legal landscape — the Constitution, statutes, 
rules, regulations, customs and common law. 
Where exclusive rule-based theories of law and 
adjudication are inadequate to explain either the 
functioning of the system or create a relief that 
ensures complete justice, it is necessary to 
supplement such a model with principles 
grounded in equitable standards. The power 
under Article 142 however is not limitless. It 
authorises the Court to pass orders to secure 
complete justice in the case before it. Article 142 
embodies both the notion of justice, equity and good 
conscience as well as a supplementary power to the 
Court to effect complete justice.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
86. The exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 142 is meant to supplement the 
existing legal framework to do complete justice between the parties.141 In a 
given circumstance, this Court can supplement a legal framework to craft a 
just outcome when strict adherence to a source of law and exclusive rule-
based theories create inequitable results.142 
87. The directions issued by this Court under Article 142 cannot be considered 
as a ratio because they are issued based on the peculiar facts and

circumstances of the cause or matter before this Court.143 In State v. Kalyan 
Singh,144 this Court observed that a judgment has two components: (a) 
declaration of law; and (b) directions. In Bir Singh v. Mukesh Kumar,145 it 
was held that what is binding on all courts under Article 141146 is the 
declaration of law, and not the directions issued under Article 142.147 
88. This Court has exercised its jurisdiction under Article 142 in tax matters where 
the actions of the Revenue are not in accordance with the law.148 In Whirlpool 
of India Ltd. v. CIT,149 this Court directed the Income Tax Officer to give effect 
to the order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal by disallowing a particular 
deduction. In CIT v. Greenworld Corporation,150 the issue before this Court 
was whether a Commissioner of Income Tax151 appropriately issued 
directions under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act to an assessing officer to 
reopen assessments. It was held that the facts of the case did not merit the 
CIT to issue directions to the assessing officer. Consequently, this Court 
 
143 J & K Public Service Commission v. Narinder Mohan, (1994) [11]. 
144 (2017). [22. […] It is important to notice that Article 142 follows upon Article 141 of the 
Constitution, in which it is stated that the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts 
within the territory of India. Thus, every judgment delivered by the Supreme Court has two components — 
the law declared which binds courts in future litigation between persons, and the doing of complete justice in 
any cause or matter which is pending before it.] 
145 (2019) [30] 
146 Article 141, Constitution of India. [It reads: 
“141. Law declared by Supreme Court to be binding on all courts – The law declared by the Supreme Court 
shall be binding on all courts within the territory of India.”] 
147 Also see State of Punjab v. Rafiq Masih, (2014) [12]. [12. […] The Court has compartmentalized 
and differentiated the relief in the operative portion of the judgment by exercise of powers under Article 142 
of the Constitution as against the law declared. The directions of the Court under Article 142 of the 
Constitution, while moulding the relief, that relax the application of law or exempt the case in hand from the 
rigour of the law in view of the peculiar facts and circumstances do not comprise the ratio decidendi and 
therefore lose its basic premise of making it a binding precedent. This Court in the qui vive has expanded 
the horizons of Article 142 of the Constitution by keeping it outside the purview of Article 141 of the

PART F 

termed the reassessment notice issued by the assessing officer to be illegal 
and exercised its jurisdiction under Article 142 to direct the reopening of the 
assessment by an appropriate assessing authority. ii. 
The scope of Ashish Agarwal extended to all the reassessment notices 
issued between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2021 under the old regime 
89. In Ashish Agarwal (supra), this Court: (i) upheld the judgments of the High 
Courts; and (ii) deemed the notices issued under Section 148 of the old 
regime as show cause notices issued under Section 148A(b) of the new 
regime. By agreeing with the judgments of the High Courts, this Court laid 
down the law that the provisions of the new regime will be applicable for all 
the reassessment notices issued under Section 148 after 1 April 2021. As a 
result of this holding, all the reassessment notices issued in terms of Section 
148 of the old regime would have been declared invalid. Therefore, this Court 
deemed the reassessment notices issued under the old regime after 1 April 
2021 as show cause notices issued under Section 148A(b) of the new regime. 
90. In Ashish Agarwal (supra), this Court rendered its decision on the premise 
that the Revenue issued approximately ninety thousand notices under the old 
regime and all of them were the subject matter of writ petitions before the High 
Courts: 
“4. At this stage, it is required to be noted that 
approximately 90,000 such reassessment notices 
under Section 148 of the unamended Income Tax 
Act were issued by the Revenue after 1-4-2021, 
which were the subject-matter of more than 9000 
writ petitions before various High Courts across the 
country and by different judgments and orders, the 
particulars of which are as above, the High Courts 

PART F 

have taken a similar view and have set aside the 
respective reassessment notices issued under 
Section 148 on similar grounds.” 
Further, this Court directed that its directions “shall be applicable PAN INDIA”: 
“29. The present order shall be applicable PAN 
INDIA and all judgments and orders passed by the 
different High Courts on the issue and under which 
similar notices which were issued after 1-4-2021 
issued under Section 148 of the Act are set aside 
and shall be governed by the present order and shall 
stand modified to the aforesaid extent. The present 
order is passed in exercise of powers under 
Article 142 of the Constitution of India so as to 
avoid any further appeals by the Revenue on the 
very issue by challenging similar judgments and 
orders, with a view not to burden this Court with 
approximately 9000 appeals. We also observe that 
the present order shall also govern the pending writ 
petitions, pending before various the High Courts in 
which similar notices under Section 148 of the Act 
issued after 1-4-2021 are under challenge.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
The purpose of this Court in deeming the reassessment notices issued under 
the old regime as show cause notices under the new regime was two-fold: (i) 
to strike a balance between the rights of the assesses and the Revenue which 
issued approximately ninety thousand reassessment notices after 1 April 
2021 under the old regime; and (ii) to avoid any further appeals before this 
Court by the Revenue on the same issue by challenging similar judgments 
and orders of the High Courts (arising from approximately nine thousand writ 
petitions). 
91. Ashish Agarwal (supra) was primarily concerned with the validity of the 
reassessment notices issued between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2021 under 

PART F 

the old regime. The scope of the directions in Ashish Agarwal (supra) applied 
PAN INDIA, including all the ninety thousand reassessment notices issued 
under the old regime during the period 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2021, as is 
evident from the following observation of this Court: 
“26. There is a broad consensus on the aforesaid 
aspects amongst the learned ASG appearing on 
behalf of the Revenue and the learned Senior 
Advocates/learned counsel appearing on behalf of 
the respective assessees. We are also of the 
opinion that if the aforesaid order is passed, it 
will strike a balance between the rights of the 
Revenue as well as the respective assessees as 
because of a bona fide belief of the officers of the 
Revenue in issuing approximately 90,000 such 
notices, the Revenue may not suffer as 
ultimately it is the public exchequer which would 
suffer.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
92. This Court specifically mentioned that its directions would also apply to three 
categories: (i) the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Judicature 
at Allahabad; (ii) all judgments and orders passed by the different High Court 
on the issue where notices issued under Section 148 of the old regime after 
1 April 2021 were set aside; and (iii) writ petitions pending before various High 
Courts in which notices under Section 148 of the old regime issued after 1 
April 2021 are under challenge.152 The Court mentioned the above three 
categories to clarify that the general nature of its directions will also give a 
quietus to the matters that have already been adjudicated or are pending 
adjudication before judicial forums. The operation of the directions cannot be 
 
152 Ashish Agarwal (supra) [27] and [29] 

PART F 

limited to the above three categories, especially when this Court has 
specifically held that “the present order shall be applicable PAN INDIA.” 
93. In Ashish Agarwal (supra), this Court was aware of the fact that it could not 
have used its jurisdiction under Article 142 to affect the vested rights of the 
assesses by deeming Section 148 notices under the old regime as Section 
148 notices under the new regime. Hence, it deemed the reassessment 
notices issued under the old regime as show cause notices under Section 
148A(b) of the new regime. Further, the Court directed the Revenue to provide 
all the relevant material or information to the assesses and thereafter allowed 
the assesses to respond to the show cause notice by availing all the defences, 
including those available under Section 149. Thus, the Court balanced the 
equities between the Revenue and the assesses by giving effect to the 
legislative scheme of reassessment as contained under the new regime. It 
supplemented the existing legal framework of the procedure of reassessment 
under the Income Tax Act with a remedy grounded in equitable standards. iii. 
Effect of the legal fiction 
94. Before we proceed, we need to bear in mind three important periods: 
i. 
The period up to 30 June 2021 – this period is covered by the provisions of 
the Income Tax Act read with TOLA; 
ii. 
The period from 1 July 2021 to 3 May 2022 – the period before the decision 
of this Court in Ashish Agarwal (supra); and 
iii. 
The period after 4 May 2022 – the period after the decision of this Court in 
Ashish Agarwal (supra). This period is covered by the directions issued by 

PART F 

this Court in Ashish Agarwal (supra) and the provisions of the Income Tax 
Act read with TOLA. a. Third proviso to Section 149 
95. The third proviso to Section 149 reads thus: 
“Provided also that for the purposes of computing 
the period of limitation as per this section, the time 
or extended time allowed to the assessee, as per 
show-cause notice issued under clause (b) of 
section 148A or the period during which the 
proceeding under section 148A is stayed by an order 
or injunction of any court, shall be excluded.” 
96. The third proviso excludes the following periods to calculate the period of 
limitation: (i) the time allowed to the assessee under Section 148A(b); and (ii) 
the period during which the proceedings under Section 148A are “stayed by 
an order or injunction of any court.” 
97. A legal fiction is a supposition of law that a thing or event exists even though, 
in reality, it does not exist.153 The word “deemed” is used to treat a thing or 
event as something, which otherwise it may not have been, with all the 
attendant consequences.154 The effect of a legal fiction is that “a position 
which otherwise would not obtain is deemed to obtain under the 
circumstances.”155 In K Prabhakaran v. P Jayarajan,156 Chief Justice R C 
Lahoti, speaking for the majority, observed that: 
“39. […] While pressing into service a legal fiction it 
should not be forgotten that legal fictions are created 
only for some definite purpose and the fiction is to be 
 
153 Gajraj Singh v. STAT, (1997) [22] 
154 CIT v. Calcutta Stock Exchange, [5]; Sudha Rani Garg v. Jagdish Kumar, 
(2004) [11] 
155 Gajraj Singh (supra) [22] 
156 (2005) 

PART F 

limited to the purpose for which it was created and 
should not be extended beyond that legitimate field. 
A legal fiction presupposes the existence of the state 
of facts which may not exist and then works out the 
consequences which flow from that state of facts. 
Such consequences have got to be worked out only 
to their logical extent having due regard to the 
purpose for which the legal fiction has been created. 
Stretching the consequences beyond what logically 
flows amounts to an illegitimate extension of the 
purpose of the legal fiction.” 
98. A legal fiction is created for a definite purpose and it should be limited to the 
purpose for which it is enacted or applied. It is a well-established principle of 
interpretation that the courts must give full effect to a legal fiction by having 
due regard to the purpose for which the legal fiction is created.157 The 
consequences that follow the creation of the legal fiction “have got to be 
worked out to their logical extent.”158 The court has to assume all the facts 
and consequences that are incidental or inevitable corollaries to giving effect 
to the fiction.159 
99. In Ashish Agarwal (supra), this Court created a legal fiction by deeming the 
Section 148 notices issued under the old regime as show cause notices under 
Section 148A(b) of the new regime. The purpose of the legal fiction was to 
enable the Revenue “to proceed further with the reassessment proceedings 
as per the substituted provisions” of the Income Tax Act. Accordingly, all the 
reassessment notices issued under the old regime were deemed to always 
have been show cause notices issued under Section 148A(b) of the new 
regime. The fiction replaced Section 148 notices with Section 148A(b) notices 
 
157 State of Maharashtra v. Laljit Rajshi Shah, (2000) [6]. 
158 Bengal Immunity Company Ltd v. State of Bihar, 
159 Industrial Supplies (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, (1980) [25] 

PART F 

with effect from the date when the notices under Section 148 of the old regime 
were issued between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2021, as the case may be. 
This ensured the continuance of the reassessment process initiated by the 
Revenue from 1 April 2021 to 30 June 2021 under the old regime. 
100. Importantly, this Court in Ashish Agarwal (supra) did not quash the 
reassessment notices issued under Section 148 of the old regime. In Shree 
Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. v. Church of South India Trust Association,160 a 
three-Judge Bench of this Court explained the distinction between quashing 
an order and staying the operation of an order thus: 
“10. […] Quashing of an order results in the 
restoration of the position as it stood on the date of 
the passing of the order which has been quashed. 
The stay of operation of an order does not, however, 
lead to such a result. It only means that the order 
which has been stayed would not be operative from 
the date of the passing of the stay order and it does 
not mean that the said order has been wiped out 
from existence.” 
The reassessment proceedings erroneously initiated by the Revenue under 
the old regime were not wiped out from existence. Consequently, the 
Revenue was not required to start the procedure of reassessment afresh after 
the decision of this Court in Ashish Agarwal (supra). 
101. Under Section 148A(b), the assessing officer has to comply with two 
requirements: (i) issuance of a show cause notice; and (ii) supply of all the 
relevant information which forms the basis of the show cause notice. The 
supply of the relevant material and information allows the assessee to 
 
160 (1992) 

PART F 

respond to the show cause notice. The deemed notices were effectively 
incomplete because the other requirement of supplying the relevant material 
or information to the assesses was not fulfilled. The second requirement could 
only have been fulfilled by the Revenue by an actual supply of the relevant 
material or information that formed the basis of the deemed notice. 
102. While creating the legal fiction in Ashish Agarwal (supra), this Court was 
cognizant of the fact that the assessing officers were effectively inhibited from 
performing their responsibility under Section 148A until the requirement of 
supply of relevant material and information to the assesses was fulfilled. This 
Court lifted the inhibition by directing the assessing officers to supply the 
assesses with the relevant material and information relied upon by the 
Revenue within thirty days from the date of the judgment. Thus, during the 
period between the issuance of the deemed notices and the date of judgment 
in Ashish Agarwal (supra), the assessing officers were deemed to have been 
prohibited from proceeding with the reassessment proceedings. 
103. In VLS Finance Limited v. Commissioner of Income Tax,161 a two-Judge 
Bench of this Court was called upon to interpret Explanation 1 to Section 
158BE of the Income Tax Act. Section 158BE provides the time limit for 
completion of block assessments. Explanation 1 to the provision excludes 
“period during which the assessment proceedings is stayed by an order or 
injunction of any court” from the period of limitation. This Court held that the 
 
161 (2016) 

PART F 

exclusion of the period of limitation has to be computed “rationally and 
practically” in the following terms: 
“18. As a general rule, therefore, when there is no 
stay of the assessment proceedings passed by the 
court, Explanation 1 to Section 158-BE of the Act 
may not be attracted. However, this general 
statement of legal principle has to be read subject to 
an exception in order to interpret it rationally and 
practically. In those cases where stay of some 
other nature is granted than the stay of the 
assessment proceedings but the effect of such 
stay is to prevent the assessing officer from 
effectively passing assessment order, even that 
kind of stay order may be treated as stay of the 
assessment proceedings because of the reason 
that such stay order becomes an obstacle for the 
assessing officer to pass an assessment order 
thereby preventing the assessing officer to 
proceed with the assessment proceedings and 
carry out appropriate assessment.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
104. Section 11-A of the Land Acquisition Act 1894 mandated the Collector to make 
an award under Section 11 within two years from the date of publication of the 
declaration. The explanation to the provision allowed exclusion of “the period 
during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the said 
declaration is stayed by an order of a court.” This Court has consistently 
interpreted the phrase “stay of action or proceedings” to mean any type of 
order passed by a court, which, in one way or another, prohibits or prevents 
the authorities from passing an award.162 Therefore, any order of a court that 
 
162 Abhey Ram v. Union of India, (1997) [9]; Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal, (2020) 
4 SCC (Civ) 496 [301]; Maharashtra Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation v. Mahesh, (2022) [39]. 

PART F 

prevents or prohibits an authority from passing an order can be treated as a 
stay order. 
105. A direction issued by this Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 
142 is an order of a court. The third proviso to Section 149 of the new regime 
provides that the period during which the proceedings under Section 148A 
are stayed by an order or injunction of any court shall be excluded for 
computation of limitation. During the period from the date of issuance of the 
deemed notice under Section 148A(b) and the date of the decision of this 
Court in Ashish Agarwal (supra), the assessing officers were deemed to 
have been prohibited from passing a reassessment order. Resultantly, the 
show cause notices were deemed to have been stayed by order of this Court 
from the date of their issuance (somewhere from 1 April 2021 till 30 June 
2021) till the date of decision in Ashish Agarwal (supra), that is, 4 May 2022. 
106. In Ashish Agarwal (supra), this Court directed the assessing officers to 
provide relevant information and materials relied upon by the Revenue to the 
assesses within thirty days from the date of the judgment. A show cause 
notice is effectively issued in terms of Section 148A(b) only if it is supplied 
along with the relevant information and material by the assessing officer. Due 
to the legal fiction, the assessing officers were deemed to have been inhibited 
from acting in pursuance of the Section 148A(b) notice till the relevant 
material was supplied to the assesses. Therefore, the show cause notices 
were deemed to have been stayed until the assessing officers provided the 
relevant information or material to the assesses in terms of the direction 
issued in Ashish Agarwal (supra). To summarize, the combined effect of the 

PART F 

legal fiction and the directions issued by this Court in Ashish Agarwal (supra) 
is that the show cause notices that were deemed to have been issued during 
the period between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2021 were stayed till the date 
of supply of the relevant information and material by the assessing officer to 
the assessee. After the supply of the relevant material and information to the 
assessee, time begins to run for the assesses to respond to the show cause 
notices. 
107. The third proviso to Section 149 allows the exclusion of time allowed for the 
assesses to respond to the show cause notice under Section 149A(b) to 
compute the period of limitation. The third proviso excludes “the time or 
extended time allowed to the assessee.” Resultantly, the entire time allowed 
to the assessee to respond to the show cause notice has to be excluded for 
computing the period of limitation. In Ashish Agarwal (supra), this Court 
provided two weeks to the assesses to reply to the show cause notices. This 
period of two weeks is also liable to be excluded from the computation of 
limitation given the third proviso to Section 149. Hence, the total time that is 
excluded for computation of limitation for the deemed notices is: (i) the time 
during which the show cause notices were effectively stayed, that is, from the 
date of issuance of the deemed notice between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 
2021 till the supply of relevant information or material by the assessing 
officers to the assesses in terms of the directions in Ashish Agarwal (supra); 
and (ii) two weeks allowed to the assesses to respond to the show cause 
notices. 

PART F 

b. 
Interplay of Ashish Agarwal with TOLA 
108. The Income Tax Act read with TOLA extended the time limit for issuing 
reassessment notices under Section 148, which fell for completion from 20 
March 2020 to 31 March 2021, till 30 June 2021. All the reassessment notices 
under challenge in the present appeals were issued from 1 April 2021 to 30 
June 2021 under the old regime. Ashish Agarwal (supra) deemed these 
reassessment notices under the old regime as show cause notices under the 
new regime with effect from the date of issuance of the reassessment notices. 
The effect of creating the legal fiction is that this Court has to imagine as real 
all the consequences and incidents that will inevitably flow from the fiction.163 
Therefore, the logical effect of the creation of the legal fiction by Ashish 
Agarwal (supra) is that the time surviving under the Income Tax Act read with 
TOLA will be available to the Revenue to complete the remaining proceedings 
in furtherance of the deemed notices, including issuance of reassessment 
notices under Section 148 of the new regime. The surviving or balance time 
limit can be calculated by computing the number of days between the date of 
issuance of the deemed notice and 30 June 2021. 
109. If this Court had not created the legal fiction and the original reassessment 
notices were validly issued according to the provisions of the new regime, the 
notices under Section 148 of the new regime would have to be issued within 
the time limits extended by TOLA. As a corollary, the reassessment notices to 
be issued in pursuance of the deemed notices must also be within the time 
 
163 East End Dwellings Co. Ltd. v. Finsbury Borough Council, [1952] AC 109. [Lord Asquith, in his concurring 
opinion, observed: “If you are bidden to treat an imaginary state of affairs as real, you must surely, unless 
prohibited from doing so, also imagine as real the consequences and incidents which, if the putative state of 
affairs had in fact existed, must inevitably have flowed from or accompanied it.”] 

PART F 

limit surviving under the Income Tax Act read with TOLA. This construction 
gives full effect to the legal fiction created in Ashish Agarwal (supra) and 
enables both the assesses and the Revenue to obtain the benefit of all 
consequences flowing from the fiction.164 
110. The effect of the creation of the legal fiction in Ashish Agarwal (supra) was 
that it stopped the clock of limitation with effect from the date of issuance of 
Section 148 notices under the old regime [which is also the date of issuance 
of the deemed notices]. As discussed in the preceding segments of this 
judgment, the period from the date of the issuance of the deemed notices till 
the supply of relevant information and material by the assessing officers to 
the assesses in terms of the directions issued by this Court in Ashish 
Agarwal (supra) has to be excluded from the computation of the period of 
limitation. Moreover, the period of two weeks granted to the assesses to reply 
to the show cause notices must also be excluded in terms of the third proviso 
to Section 149. 
111. The clock started ticking for the Revenue only after it received the response 
of the assesses to the show causes notices. After the receipt of the reply, the 
assessing officer had to perform the following responsibilities: (i) consider the 
reply of the assessee under Section 149A(c); (ii) take a decision under 
Section 149A(d) based on the available material and the reply of the 
assessee; and (iii) issue a notice under Section 148 if it was a fit case for 
reassessment. Once the clock started ticking, the assessing officer was 
 
164 See State of A P v. A P Pensioners Association, (2005) [28]. [This Court observed that the 
“legal fiction undoubtedly is to be construed in such a manner so as to enable a person, for whose benefit 
such legal fiction has been created, to obtain all consequences flowing therefrom.”] 

PART F 

required to complete these procedures within the surviving time limit. The 
surviving time limit, as prescribed under the Income Tax Act read with TOLA, 
was available to the assessing officers to issue the reassessment notices 
under Section 148 of the new regime. 
112. Let us take the instance of a notice issued on 1 May 2021 under the old 
regime for a relevant assessment year. Because of the legal fiction, the 
deemed show cause notices will also come into effect from 1 May 2021. After 
accounting for all the exclusions, the assessing officer will have sixty-one 
days [days between 1 May 2021 and 30 June 2021] to issue a notice under 
Section 148 of the new regime. This time starts ticking for the assessing 
officer after receiving the response of the assessee. In this instance, if the 
assessee submits the response on 18 June 2022, the assessing officer will 
have sixty-one days from 18 June 2022 to issue a reassessment notice under 
Section 148 of the new regime. Thus, in this illustration, the time limit for 
issuance of a notice under Section 148 of the new regime will end on 18 
August 2022. 
113. In Ashish Agarwal (supra), this Court allowed the assesses to avail all the 
defences, including the defence of expiry of the time limit specified under 
Section 149(1). In the instant appeals, the reassessment notices pertain to 
the assessment years 2013-2014, 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 
2017-2018. To assume jurisdiction to issue notices under Section 148 with 
respect to the relevant assessment years, an assessing officer has to: (i) 
issue the notices within the period prescribed under Section 149(1) of the new 
regime read with TOLA; and (ii) obtain the previous approval of the authority 

PART G 

specified under Section 151. A notice issued without complying with the 
preconditions is invalid as it affects the jurisdiction of the assessing officer. 
Therefore, the reassessment notices issued under Section 148 of the new 
regime, which are in pursuance of the deemed notices, ought to be issued 
within the time limit surviving under the Income Tax Act read with TOLA. A 
reassessment notice issued beyond the surviving time limit will be time-
barred. 
G. 
 Conclusions 
114. In view of the above discussion, we conclude that: 
a. After 1 April 2021, the Income Tax Act has to be read along with the 
substituted provisions; 
b. TOLA will continue to apply to the Income Tax Act after 1 April 2021 if any 
action or proceeding specified under the substituted provisions of the 
Income Tax Act falls for completion between 20 March 2020 and 31 March 
2021; 
c. Section 3(1) of TOLA overrides Section 149 of the Income Tax Act only to 
the extent of relaxing the time limit for issuance of a reassessment notice 
under Section 148; 
d. TOLA will extend the time limit for the grant of sanction by the authority 
specified under Section 151. The test to determine whether TOLA will apply 
to Section 151 of the new regime is this: if the time limit of three years from 
the end of an assessment year falls between 20 March 2020 and 31 March 

PART G 

2021, then the specified authority under Section 151(i) has extended time 
till 30 June 2021 to grant approval; 
e. In the case of Section 151 of the old regime, the test is: if the time limit of 
four years from the end of an assessment year falls between 20 March 2020 
and 31 March 2021, then the specified authority under Section 151(2) has 
extended time till 31 March 2021 to grant approval; 
f. The directions in Ashish Agarwal (supra) will extend to all the ninety 
thousand reassessment notices issued under the old regime during the 
period 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2021; 
g. The time during which the show cause notices were deemed to be stayed is 
from the date of issuance of the deemed notice between 1 April 2021 and 
30 June 2021 till the supply of relevant information and material by the 
assessing officers to the assesses in terms of the directions issued by this 
Court in Ashish Agarwal (supra), and the period of two weeks allowed to 
the assesses to respond to the show cause notices; and 
h. The assessing officers were required to issue the reassessment notice 
under Section 148 of the new regime within the time limit surviving under 
the Income Tax Act read with TOLA. All notices issued beyond the surviving 
period are time barred and liable to be set aside;
