JUDGMENT 

SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J. 
 
1. 
Two questions arise in these appeals for our determination. 
The first question is whether “ghee” is a “product of livestock” 
under the provisions of The Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural 
Produce and Livestock) Markets Act, 1966 (hereinafter referred 
to as “the Act”) and the second would be whether the 
Government notification (G.O. Ms. No.286 dated 05.07.1994), 
which inter alia notifies “ghee” as one of the products of 
livestock for the purpose of regulation of purchase and sale of 
“ghee” in all notified market areas was published after due 
compliance of the procedure contemplated under the 
provisions of the Act? 
2. 
In the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh, the above Act was 
brought with the purpose to consolidate and amend the laws 
regulating the purchase and sale of agricultural produce, 
livestock and products of livestock, along with establishment 
of markets in connection therewith. The aim was to secure 
effective and remunerative price of commodities by bringing 
producers and traders face to face thereby eliminating 
middlemen and do away with some other earlier unethical 
trade practices, which were exploiting agriculturists and 

farmers. In other words, it was a farmer friendly legislation. 
The commodities which were to be regulated were not only 
agricultural produce but also livestock as well as products of 
livestock. Whereas livestock has been defined under Section 
2(v) and products of livestock has been defined under Section 
2(xv). Both the Sections are reproduced below: 
(v) 'livestock' means cows, buffaloes, bullocks, 
bulls, goats and sheep, and includes poultry, fish 
and such other animals as may be declared by 
the Government by notification to be livestock for 
the 
purposes 
of 
this 
Act; 
 
(xv) 'products of livestock' means such 
products of livestock as may be declared by the 
Government by notification, to be products of 
livestock for the purposes of this Act. 
 
3. 
Under sub-Section (1) of Section 3 of the Act, the Government 
has to initially publish a draft notification declaring its 
intention of regulating purchase and sale of proposed notified 
agricultural produce, livestock or products of livestock in an 
area. It is only after hearing objections from public, it finally 
publishes its notification under sub-Section (3) of Section 3 
declaring the area to be a ‘notified area’ in respect of such 
agricultural produce, livestock and products of livestock. 
Under Sub-Section (4) of Section 3 the Government also has a 

power to exclude from a notified area, any area earlier included 
in it. 
4. 
After a notification is made under Section 3, there comes the 
process of notification under Section 4 of the Act. Under 
Section 4 (1) of the Act, a process is given wherein the 
Government further notifies a market committee for every 
notified area. Under Sub Section (3) of Section 4, the market 
committee is empowered to establish markets for the purchase 
and sale of any notified agricultural produce, livestock or 
products of livestock. After the establishment of markets by 
the market committee under Section 4 (3), the Government 
declares by a notification under Section 4 (4)1, the ‘notified 
market area’ for the purposes of the Act in respect of the 
notified products. 
In short, the above provisions provide that first there will be 
a larger physical unit called “notified area” wherein the market 
committee shall establish markets and thereafter, through a 
notification u/s 4 (4), the Govt. declares a “notified market 
area” in respect of the notified products. 
 
1 Section 4 (4) stands omitted vide the Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock) 
Markets (Amendment) Act, 2015. 

5. 
In the year 1968, the State of Andhra Pradesh had issued a 
notification u/s 3 (3) of the Act declaring “notified areas” in the 
State where “ghee” was included in Schedule II of the said 
notification as a livestock product. Thereafter, in the year 
1971, a notification u/s 4 (4) was published, which declared 
the ‘notified market areas’ in respect of the respondent-
committee, i.e. Agricultural Market Committee, Guntur and 
“ghee” was specified as a notified product. However, in 1972 
the 1971 notification was amended and “ghee” was taken out 
of the list of notified livestock products in respect of the 
respondent-committee, and it remained so for a considerable 
period of time. We must clarify here that both these 
notifications i.e., notifications of 1971 & 1972 were issued u/s 
4 (4) of the Act and not u/s 3 (3) of the Act. 
6. 
Later, on 15.07.1994, the Govt of A.P. published a general 
notification directing all the notified markets within the State 
of AP to regulate all the products notified in Schedule II of the 
1968 Notification, which also included Ghee. 
7. 
It is this notification of the year 1994 which came to be 
challenged by the producers of livestock products and which 
has now before us for determination. This notification was 
challenged before the Andhra Pradesh High Court on two 

grounds. The first challenge was that “ghee” is not a “product 
of livestock” and therefore cannot be regulated and notified. 
The second ground for challenge was that there is a procedure 
which is laid down under the law, mainly under Section 3 of 
the Act which prescribes the process i.e., first a draft 
notification has to be published, objections are invited against 
the notification and only after hearing such objections can this 
notification be made. It was contended that this process has 
not been followed and therefore the notification is bad. 
8. 
This matter ultimately went to a Full Bench of the Andhra 
Pradesh High Court in titled 
Kommisetty Nammalwar & Co. Guntur v. Agricultural 
Market Committee, Tenali & Ors. (2009) SCC OnLine AP 
317 and by a 2:1 majority, the Andhra Pradesh High Court 
rejected the argument of the appellants and upheld the 
notification of the year 1994, holding that the notification 
under challenge is not under Section 3 but under Section 4 of 
the Act, and is valid and moreover “ghee” is a livestock 
product. Based on the said judgment the Writ Petitions filed 
by the appellants in Civil Appeal Nos. 6493 of 2014 (M/s 

Guntur District Milk Production2), 6494 of 2014 (M/s. 
Lakshmi Das Premji Ghee Merchants), 6496 of 2014 (M/s 
Durga Dairy Ltd.), 6497 of 2014 (The Krishna District Milk 
Producers Co-operative Union Ltd., Vijaywada) & 6498 of 2014 
(M/s. Karnataka Co-operative Milk Producers Federation 
Limited) were also dismissed by the Andhra Pradesh High 
Court. The decision of the Full Bench in Kommisetty 
Nammalwar (supra) upholding the validity of the 1994 
notification is also under challenge before us in C.A No.6495 
of 2014. 
9. 
We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
have perused the material on record. 
10. 
The argument that “ghee” is not a product of livestock is 
baseless, and bereft of any logic. The contrary argument that 
“ghee” is indeed a product of livestock is logically sound. 
Livestock has been defined under Section 2(v) of the Act, where 
Cows and buffalos are the livestock. Undisputedly, “ghee” is a 
product of milk which is a product of the livestock. The 
majority opinion of the Full Bench decision in Kommisetty 
Nammalwar (supra) while referring to the judgments of this 
 
2 Vide Order dated 02.01.2024 passed by this Court in IA No.241663 of 2023 in CA No.6493 
of 2014 name of appellant is amended as Sangam Milk Producer Company Ltd. 

Court in Park Leather Industry (P) Ltd. v. State of U.P. 
(2001); Kishan Lal v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 
1990 SC 2269; Ram Chandra Kailash Kumar v. State of 
U.P. 1980 Supp (1) SCC 27 and Smt. Sita Devi (Dead) by 
LRs. v. State of Bihar & Ors. 1995 Supp (1) SSC 670 held 
that all animal husbandry products would fall within the 
meaning of ‘products of livestock’ as defined under Section 2 
(xv) of the Act. Further, the majority decision has also held 
that the inclusion of “ghee” as a livestock product cannot be 
faulted merely because it is derived from another dairy 
product. It was observed by the High Court that even though 
“ghee” is not directly obtained from milk, which is a product of 
livestock, it would still be a “product of a product of livestock”. 
The relevant portion of the judgment of the High Court is as 
under: 
“Scientifically or common sense point of 
view, even though ghee is not directly 
obtained from milk (which is certainly a 
product of cow/buffalo), it is certainly a 
product of a product of livestock i.e., cow or 
buffalo. It would be rather illogical or 
irrational to say that ghee is not a milk/dairy 
product or to say that it is not a product of 
livestock. Ghee is certainly a product of 
livestock. It is, therefore, to be seen whether 
ghee comes within the definition of product 
of livestock or within the meaning of notified 
product of livestock. Section 2(x) and 2(xv) of 

the Act used the plural ‘products of 
livestock’. The legislative intention is very 
clear that not only a product of livestock like 
milk (when notified by the Government), 
butter etc., are products of livestock but even 
derivative items (derived from a product of 
livestock) are intended to be product of 
livestock for the purpose of the Act. We are 
convinced that the term ‘ghee’ has to be 
interpreted on the basis of expression 
‘products of livestock’ as defined in Section 
2(xv) of the Act. Whatever products are 
declared as such by the Government by 
notification, 
they 
become 
products 
of 
livestock for purposes of the Act.” 
 
Another case of which a reference must be made here is the 
decision taken by this Court in Park Leather Industry (P) 
LTD. v. State of U.P. and Others (2001). In this 
case, the Supreme Court was dealing with the provisions of 
U.P. Krishi Utpadan Mandi Adhiniyam, 1964, which has a 
provision dealing with similar issues as are there before this 
Court. In the U.P. Act, “agricultural produce” was widely 
defined and it included inter alia produce of animal husbandry 
which were specified in the schedule. In the schedule, one of 
the items was prescribed under the head “animal husbandry 
products” was “hides and skins”. The question was whether 
tanned leather would come within the term “hides and skins” 
or not? This Court held that the term “tanned leather” can be 

included under “hides and skins”, for the purposes of the Act 
and more importantly for the purposes of payment of “market 
fee”. The reason being that although while making a leather 
into “tanned leather” a process of cleaning, curing and adding 
preservatives may be adopted, yet the finished product which 
is “tanned leather” though different in physical appearance or 
even chemical combination and even commercially a different 
item still remains “leather” and would come under the 
definition of “hides and skins”. The same reasoning has been 
adopted by the Full Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court that 
‘Ghee’ is derived out of ‘milk’ by undergoing a process, yet it 
still remains a product of livestock, for the purposes of the Act 
and payment of “market fee”. 
We are absolutely in agreement with the above reasoning. 
11. 
The second argument of the appellant that the procedure given 
under Section 3 of the Act has not been followed, is also not 
correct. There is a basic difference between the notification 
which has to be made under Section 3 of the Act and the 
notification which has to be made subsequently under Section 
4 of the Act. What has to be done under Section 3 is a one-
time measure where the Government notifies an area where 
purchase and sale of agricultural produce, livestock and 

products of livestock can be made. This is a one-time exercise. 
What happens under Section 4 of the Act is that the Govt. declares the ‘notified market area’ in respect of any notified 
product (products which have already been notified under 
section 3 of the Act). A perusal of Sections 3 and 4 of the Act 
clearly shows that whereas a draft notification is mandatory 
under Section 3 and so is the hearing of objections to the draft 
notification, there is no similar provision under Section 4 of 
the Act. 
 The two Sections of the Act Section 3 and Section 4 are 
being reproduced below for a comparative analysis: 
Section 3 
Section 4

comprised therein; or 
 
 (b) include in any notified 
market 
area, 
any 
area 
specified 
in 
such 
notification.]5 

 After discussing provisions of Sections 3 & 4 of the Act, the 
majority opinion in the Full Bench concluded that procedural 
compliance is only necessary when there is a declaration or 
later a merger/de-merger of a notified area and there is no 
requirement of following any particular procedure while 
issuing a notification under Section 4 (4) of the Act 
notifying/de-notifying any already notified products for the 
purpose of regulation by any respective Agricultural Market 
Committee (AMC). In other words, a prior hearing or prior 
 
5 Omitted vide the Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock) Markets (Amendment) Act, 2015. publication of the draft notification is not a requirement under 
Section 4 of the Act, since the notification of the year 1994 is 
a notification under Section 4 and not of Section 3 of the Act. 
Therefore, the argument that the process under Section 3, has 
not been followed is totally misconceived. No prior process 
was required to be followed as contemplated under Section 3 
of the Act for working the scheme under Section 4 of the Act. 
Consequently, we hold that there was nothing wrong in the 
1994 notification and the challenge to the notification has 
rightly been turned down by the Full Bench of the Andhra 
Pradesh High Court. 
12. 
We are now left with one more issue related to the market fee. 
Since the 1994 notification had an effect which made ‘Ghee’ a 
product that could be regulated under provisions of the Act, 
Market Committees were empowered to levy fee on the sale and 
purchase of ‘ghee’ as per section 12 of the Act. During the 
pendency of the matter before the High Court, the appellants 
were not required to pay market fee as they were granted 
interim protection by the High Court. After the majority 
decision of the High Court in Kommissetty Nammalwar 
(Supra), market committees started issuing demand notices to 
the producers of ‘Ghee’ asking them to pay fees from the date 

of the notification in the year 1994 to the date of the High 
Court judgment i.e. 01.05.2009. This issue was also raised by 
appellants in the present appeals and it was prayed that they 
should be exempted from paying the fee to the market 
committees prior to the High Court judgment. This Court while 
issuing the notices in present matters, vide interim order, 
restrained market committees from collecting the market fees 
for the period prior to the High Court judgment. Even some of 
the present appeals were heard on this limited question. 
13. 
As per section 4(2) of the Act, the Market Committee has the 
duty to enforce the provisions of the Act within a notified area. 
Section 4(3), which empowers Market Committees to establish 
markets within the notified area, also directs that these 
Market Committees have to provide facilities in the markets 
for the purchase and sale of notified products. Appellants’ 
argument that these Market Committees did not provide any 
facilities has already been dealt with and rejected by the High 
Court and we are also of the same view as that taken by the 
High Court. The appellants have availed the facility given by 
the Market Committee and hence they are liable to pay the fee. 
There may also be a question of unjust enrichment here. For 
all these reasons, we are of the opinion that this market fee 

should be paid as well. The appellants' prayer that 
Respondent Market Committees should be restrained from 
collecting market fees prior to the date of the High Court 
Judgment cannot be accepted. All the same, since this fee 
which has now accumulated for more than 14 years between 
05.07.1994 to 01.05.2009 may entail some hardship on the 
appellants, they shall be permitted to deposit this fee with the 
Committee within two years from today, in four equal 
instalments. 
14. 
Consequently, we dismiss these appeals and uphold the 
majority decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. The 
interim orders passed by this Court in the present batch of 
cases where we had restrained the respondents from collecting 
market fees prior to the date of the High Court judgment 
during the pendency of these appeals, stand vacated.
