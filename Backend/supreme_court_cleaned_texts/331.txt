JUDGMENT

 Leave granted. 
 
2. 
This appeal, by the State of Orissa, arises out of 
the impugned judgment dated 17.01.2018 passed 
by the High Court of Orissa, which quashed the 
order dated 26.09.2015 passed by the SDJM, 
Cuttack in G.R. Case No.1771 of 2005 for taking 
cognizance of offences under sections 420, 467, 
468, 471, 477(A), 120(B) and 34 Indian Penal 

SLP(Crl.) No. 5758 of 2018 

Code, 18601 and directing issuance of process 
against the Respondents. 
3. 
The facts leading up to the present case are as 
follows: 
3.1 On 20.05.2005, an FIR registered as Capital P.S. 
Case No. 178 of 2005 was lodged by the then 
Special Secretary to the Government in the 
General 
Administration 
(G.A.) 
Department, 
alleging a widespread conspiracy involving the 
forgery of documents to facilitate the illegal 
transfer of valuable government land to private 
entities. Following the FIR, the Police initiated 
investigations that culminated in a chargesheet 
filed against ten individuals, including the present 
respondents, accusing them of engaging in a 
criminal conspiracy under sections 420, 467, 468, 
471, 477A, 120B and 34 IPC. 
3.2 The chargesheet dated 28.08.2015 detailed that 
the respondents, along with other co-conspirators, 
allegedly utilized forged documents such as Hata 
Patas, Ekpadia, and rent receipts to manipulate 
judicial processes and revenue records to illegally

SLP(Crl.) No. 5758 of 2018 

acquire government lands. These documents were 
purportedly produced in various revenue and civil 
courts to secure favorable orders, which were then 
used to substantiate false claims of ownership 
over the disputed properties. 
3.3 Central to the allegations is a transaction 
involving the sale of land situated in the heart of 
Bhubaneshwar, initially leased to one Kamala 
Devi under dubious circumstances before the 
independence of India. After her demise, her legal 
heir, Kishore Chandra Patnaik, continued to 
assert rights over the property based on this lease, 
which had been previously declared non-genuine 
by the competent authorities. Despite adverse 
findings, the OEA Collector and subsequent 
judicial rulings set aside earlier decisions and 
reinstated the lease, albeit amidst allegations of 
document manipulation and improper legal 
proceedings. 
3.4 In the year 2000, Kishore Chandra Patnaik, 
through a General Power of Attorney2, granted 
Anup Kumar Dhirsamant (accused no. 5), a real 
 
2 In short, “GPA” 

SLP(Crl.) No. 5758 of 2018 

estate developer, the authority to manage and 
dispose of the property. It is alleged that this GPA 
was later found to be interpolated towards 
transactions favourable to the Respondents and 
the 
other 
accused 
persons. 
Following 
the 
interpolation, Dhirsamant executed sales of 
substantial portions of the land to the respondents 
at rates grossly undervalued, as per the market 
rates at the time and transactions that were 
finalized without proper scrutiny of the title's 
legitimacy or the GPA's authenticity. 
3.5 On 26.09.2015, the SDJM, Bhubaneshwar passed 
an order of cognizance for offence u/s 420, 467, 
468, 471, 477(A), 120(B) and 34 IPC and issue of 
process against the Respondents and the other 
accused persons which was challenged by the 
Respondents before the High Court. 
3.6 The High Court in its impugned judgment, 
quashed the order taking cognizance against the 
respondents. 
It 
reasoned 
that 
there 
was 
insufficient evidence of a conspiracy directly 
implicating the respondents and criticized the 
preliminary stage of judicial scrutiny as overly 
thorough, contrary to the standards required for 

SLP(Crl.) No. 5758 of 2018 

prima facie evaluation at the stage of taking 
cognizance. 
4. 
The appellant-State contends that the High Court 
overlooked circumstantial evidence suggestive of a 
broader conspiracy involving the respondents, 
particularly 
highlighting 
their 
professional 
acumen in real estate, which should have 
informed them of the dubious nature of the 
transactions. Furthermore, the State argued that 
the High Court failed to appreciate the severity of 
the 
offences 
involved 
and 
the 
potential 
implications for governance and public trust in the 
administration of land records. 
5. 
Having heard the arguments on both sides, this 
Court is of the belief that the impugned order of 
the High Court merits reconsideration. The 
investigation into Respondent No. 1 (accused no. 
7) and Respondent No. 2 (accused no. 10) reveals 
their critical roles in the misuse of GPA and 
subsequent property transactions, presenting a 
strong prima facie case for further examination. 
Initially, Kishore Chandra Patnaik granted a GPA 
to M/s Millan Developer and Builders Pvt. Ltd., 
represented by Anup Kumar Dhirsamanta. This 

SLP(Crl.) No. 5758 of 2018 

GPA was registered outside the proper jurisdiction 
by including a small, unrelated parcel of land to 
falsely extend the Sub-Registrar of Khandagiri's 
authority. This setup was key to the subsequent 
illegal activities. 
6. 
The manipulation of the GPA where specific terms 
were altered to misrepresent the authority 
granted, was carried out with the help of one Ajya 
Kumar Samal, a junior clerk (accused no.3). This 
act of forgery was a deliberate attempt to 
circumvent the legal procedure for transferring 
property. Following this forgery, extensive lands 
were 
sold 
at 
significantly 
lowered 
values. 
Specifically, lands in the heart of Bhubaneswar 
city were acquired for as little as Rs. 9,000/- per 
acre, 
whereas 
the 
prevailing 
market 
rates 
exceeded Rs. 50 lakhs per acre. Such drastic 
undervaluation 
raises 
substantial 
questions 
regarding the intent behind these transactions, 
indicative of a deliberate scheme to evade 
appropriate stamp duties and registration fees, 
causing considerable loss to the state. Crucially, 
part of this land was bought under suspicious 
conditions by Respondent No. 1 and Puspa 

SLP(Crl.) No. 5758 of 2018 

Choudhury 
(accused 
no.8), 
in 
transactions 
managed by Prahallad Nanda (accused no. 2), who 
was temporarily in charge of the Sub-Registrar's 
office. The intentional undervaluation of this land 
and the strategic involvement of Respondent No. 
1, in conjunction with the revocation of the GPA 
due to its fraudulent tampering, highlight a clear 
scheme to misappropriate government property 
and incur losses upon the public exchequer. 
7. 
Furthermore, Respondent No. 1, who is the wife of 
Respondent No. 2, the Managing Director of M/s 
Z Engineer's Construction Pvt. Ltd., was central to 
the planning and execution of these transactions. 
Both respondents, along with their connections in 
the Real Estates Developers Association and their 
familiarity with key figures in the real estate 
sector, played pivotal roles in this conspiracy. 
Their 
professional 
positions 
and 
industry 
influence were misused to facilitate and conceal 
these transactions. 
8. 
This Court believes that dismissing the case at the 
preliminary stage, especially when linked to a 
broader pattern of similar frauds involving 
government lands as part of a larger conspiracy, 

SLP(Crl.) No. 5758 of 2018 

risks undermining the integrity of multiple 
ongoing investigations and judicial processes. 
Such a decision would be detrimental to the 
investigation 
of 
similar 
fraudulent 
schemes 
against public assets. 
9. 
Therefore, this Court finds that the High Court's 
decision to quash the proceedings was based on 
an incomplete assessment of the facts, which 
could only be fully unraveled through a detailed 
trial process. The nature and extent of the alleged 
conspiracy, the involvement of the respondents, 
and the actual harm caused to the public 
exchequer need to be judiciously examined in a 
trial setting. The High Court has hastily concluded 
that there is no evidence to show meeting of minds 
between the other accused persons and the 
Respondents which in our considered opinion, can 
only be decided after a thorough examination of 
evidence and witnesses by the Trial Court. 
10. In view of the above, the appeal is allowed. The 
impugned order of the High Court is set aside. The 
trial to proceed in accordance with law against the 
respondents also. As the FIR is of the year 2005, 

SLP(Crl.) No. 5758 of 2018 

the Trial Court is directed to decide the trial 
expeditiously.
