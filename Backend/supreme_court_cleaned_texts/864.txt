CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
 
CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS. 388-389 OF 2024 

SONU AGNIHOTRI 

 …APPELLANT 

VERSUS 

CHANDRA SHEKHAR & ORS. …RESPONDENTS 

JUDGMENT 
 
ABHAY S. OKA, J. 
 
1. 
The appellant is serving as an Additional District and 
Sessions Judge in Delhi judicial service. The appellant has 
preferred 
these 
appeals 
for 
expunging 
adverse 
findings/remarks recorded against him in paragraphs 13 
and 14 of the first impugned order dated 2nd March 2023 
by the Delhi High Court. The appellant moved an 
application before the Delhi High Court for expunging the 
remarks in paragraphs 11 to 14 of the first impugned order 
dated 2nd March 2023. By an order dated 9th May 2023, 
the said application was rejected by the High Court. This 
is the second impugned order. 

FACTUAL ASPECTS 
2. 
The appellant was dealing with an application for 
anticipatory bail filed by one Vikas Gulati icky in FIR 
No.221/2022 registered for the offences punishable under 
Sections 380 and 411 read with Section 34 of the Indian 
Penal Code (for short, ‘the IPC’) with Defence Colony Police 
Station. The appellant had earlier rejected another 
application for anticipatory bail made by co-accused 
Sunita and Raj Bala on 2nd January 2023. The anticipatory 
bail application of Vikas Gulati came up before the 
appellant on 21st January 2023. By a detailed order, the 
appellant rejected the said application. While rejecting the 
application, 
the 
appellant 
made 
certain 
adverse 
observations about the conduct of the police officers and 
issued 
certain 
directions. 
The 
following 
are 
the 
observations made by the appellant in the order: 
“ Perusal of police file shows that after 
case diary of 23.12.2022, the next day on 
which case diary was written by IO is of 
date 04.01.2023. IO has not written any 
case diary for date 02.01.2023 on which 
date, anticipatory bail applications of co-
accused Sunita and Raj Bala were 
dismissed. IO has written in case diary of 
04.01.2023 that notices U/sec 41 A Cr. P. 
C were issued to co-accused Sunita and 
Raj Bala and all this was apprised to SHO 
PS Defence Colony. 

 It is surprising that despite opposing 
anticipatory bail applications of co-
accused 
Sunita 
and 
Raj 
Bala 
and 
submitting before court that their custody 
is required for recovery of stolen sarees, IO 
instead of arresting them made them join 
investigation after serving notices U/sec 
41A Cr. P. C. There was no need to oppose 
anticipatory bail applications of co-
accused Sunita and Raj Bala in case, their 
custody was not required by IO. When 
police has opposed anticipatory bail 
applications of co-accused Sunita and Raj 
Bala before court but made them join 
investigation by serving notice U/sec 41A 
Cr. P.C, it appears that there is 
something fishy on part of police. 
…………………………………………………..” 
(emphasis added) 
 
After making the above observations, the appellant dealt 
with the merits of the bail application and concluded that 
the accused before him was not entitled to the relief of 
anticipatory bail. Thereafter, the appellant observed thus: 
 
“From conduct of IO, it appears that he is 
not carrying out investigation in a 
proper manner and there is something 
more written on wall than visible.” 
(emphasis added) 
 
3. 
The appellant observed that despite so many orders 
passed by the court, the updated status of cases pending 

against the accused had not been mentioned in the 
previous involvement report of the accused filed, along 
with a reply to the anticipatory bail application. 
Thereafter, the appellant issued the following directions: 
 
“ Issue show cause notice to SHO PS 
Defence Colony and IO HC Raj Kumar 
U/sec 177 IPC for furnishing false 
information to this court through DCP, 
South for 31.01.2023. 
 Let copy of order be sent to DCP, 
South to inquire about role of IO as well 
as 
SHO 
PS 
Defence 
Colony 
in 
investigation of present case in view of 
observations of this court as have come 
in this order with direction to file 
Action Taken Report against the erring 
officials and file report in this regard 
before this court on 31.01.2023. 
 Let explanation be sought from CP, 
Delhi as to why SCRB record is not being 
updated till date despite direction of this 
court way back about one and half years 
ago in FIR No. 16/2018, PS Govind Puri 
for 31.01.2023 with direction to fix 
responsibility of concerned official for 
failure to comply with the same. It is 
notable that once, punishment of censure 
has already been awarded to defaulting 
SHOs and advisory has been issued to all 
defaulting ACPs as per explanation earlier 
called 
from 
CP, 
Delhi 
and 
reports 
furnished by DCP, South and DCP, 
South-East on behalf of CP, Delhi in 
another matter but still, there is no 
improvement which practically shows that 

even higher hierarchy in police has failed 
to instill discipline in Delhi Police. 
 Let copy of order be sent to CP, Delhi for 
information and compliance. 
 Let copy of order be sent to SHO PS 
Defence 
Colony 
for 
reference 
and 
compliance.” 
(emphasis added) 
 
4. 
Further order was passed by the appellant on 31st 
January 2023 in which it was observed that though the 
appellant had asked DCP (Deputy Commissioner of Police), 
South to hold an inquiry about the role of Investigating 
Officer (IO) as well as Station House Officer (SHO) of 
Defence Colony Police Station, only show cause notices of 
censure have been issued to the officers. The appellant 
observed that the report of DCP, South, was silent about 
the observation made in the earlier order that there was 
something fishy in the investigation. Therefore, the 
appellant observed that the order dated 21st January 2023 
has not been taken into consideration by the DCP, South. 
Hence, the appellant directed the Commissioner of Police, 
Delhi, to conduct a vigilance inquiry against the IO and 
SHO of Defence Colony Police Station. However, the 
appellant dropped the show cause notice issued to IO and 
SHO under the order dated 21st January 2023 for showing 

cause why they should not be prosecuted under Section 
177 of the IPC. 
5. 
The IO and SHO filed a petition under Section 482 of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, ‘the CrPC’) 
for expunging the remarks made against them in the 
orders dated 21st January 2023 and 31st January 2023. A 
prayer was also made to set aside the direction issued to 
the Commissioner of Police, Delhi to hold vigilance inquiry 
against them. By the first impugned order, the learned 
Single Judge of the High Court directed that all remarks 
made against the IO and SHO in the orders dated 21st 
January 2023 and 31st January 2023 shall stand 
expunged. Even the directions issued by the appellant 
against the Commissioner of Police and the Deputy 
Commissioner of Police were ordered to be deleted. 
6. 
As seen from the grounds taken in the appeals and 
written submissions dated 30th September 2024, the 
appellant's grievance is about remarks recorded against 
him in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the first impugned order. 
The said remarks are as follows: 
“13. 
Not 
only 
are 
such 
remarks 
unnecessary but also could have serious 
implications on the careers of public 
servants, particularly for what seems in 
the 
facts 
and 
circumstances 
as 
perfunctory issues which have no huge 
negative 
impact 
on 
the 
actual 

administration of the criminal justice 
process. As discussed above, the Ld. 
ASJ ought not to have embarked on an 
inexorable quest when his original 
concern had been suitably addressed. 
The remarks and the phraseology used 
by the Ld. ASJ is summary in nature, 
penal in its scope, stigmatizing in its 
tone 
and 
tenor 
and 
as 
already 
motioned, beyond the ken of expected 
judicial conduct. In these facts and 
circumstances it is directed that all 
remarks against the petitioners in orders 
dated 21st January, 2023 and 31st 
January, 2023 passed by Ld., Additional 
Sessions judge, South East, Saket Courts, 
New Delhi in Bail Appl. No. 202/2023 
shall be expunged and all directions for 
conducting enquiries and explanations by 
the DCP or the Commissioner of Police 
shall be recalled and stand deleted from 
the 
said 
orders. 
14………………………………………………… 
It is expected therefore that the Ld. ASJ 
would be circumspect and exercise care 
and caution in future before embarking 
on these judicial misadventures.” 
7. 
We must note here that the appellant applied for 
impleading the High Court of Delhi as a party through its 
Registrar General. The said application was allowed. A 
short reply was filed on behalf of the High Court by O.S.D. 
(Rules and Litigation) in which reliance was placed on Rule 
6, Part H, Chapter I of Volume III of the High Court Rules 
and Orders. Rule 6 provided that it is undesirable for 
courts to make remarks censuring the action of police 

officers unless such remarks are strictly relevant to the 
case. It also provided that there should not be any over-
alacrity on the part of Judicial Officers to believe anything 
and everything against the police. Prima facie, we were of 
the view that this Rule interferes with the discretion 
available to the judges. It is unnecessary for us now to deal 
with Rule 6 as a document has been placed on record by 
the learned ASG appearing for the High Court that the Rule 
Committee of the High Court has approved the deletion of 
Rule 6 and the approval of the Hon’ble Governor has been 
sought for the deletion. 
SUBMISSIONS 
8. 
Learned counsel appearing for the appellant has 
invited our attention to factual aspects of the case dealt 
with by the appellant, which warranted the appellant to 
pass strict orders against the Police Officers and issue 
directions referred to above. He pointed out that the 
appellant did not take forward the show cause notice 
issued to the IO and SHO, calling upon them to show cause 
as to why criminal law should not be set in motion against 
them for the offence punishable under Section 177 of the 
IPC. He pointed out that all that the appellant did was point 
out flaws in the investigation and the failure to update 
SCRB data. He submitted that there was non-compliance 
with the standard operating procedure dated 29th January 
2021 issued by the Office of Commissioner of Police of 

Delhi, through Deputy Commissioner of Police, on this 
behalf. He submitted that nothing is wrong if the appellant 
criticises the IO for not properly maintaining the case 
diary. 
9. 
Coming to the remarks made in the first impugned 
order, he relied upon decisions of this Court in the case of 
V.K. Jain v. High Court of Delhi through Registrar 
General and Ors.1, K.P. Tiwari v. State of M.P.2 and in 
Re: ‘K’, A Judicial Officer3. He submits that the remarks 
against the appellant in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the first 
impugned order deserve to be expunged. He submitted that 
in the first impugned order, the High Court relied upon its 
own decision in the case of Ajit Kumar v. State (NCT of 
Delhi)4, which in turn relies upon Rule 6, which has been 
now deleted. 
10. He submitted that due to the adverse remarks against 
the appellant in the first impugned order, the unblemished 
career of the appellant as a Judicial Officer is likely to be 
adversely affected. He also invited our attention to 
observations made by this Court in the case of Dayal 
Singh and Ors. v. State of Uttaranchal5.

2 1994 Supp (1) SCC 540 
3 (2001) 
4 2022 SCC OnLine Del 3945 
5 (2012) 

11. The learned counsel representing the State has 
assisted the Court by pointing out the law on this aspect. 
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS 
12. There are two parts of the first impugned order. The 
first part concerns expunging the observations and 
findings recorded by the appellant against the IO and SHO 
and setting aside the direction issued by the appellant to 
the Commissioner of Police for holding an inquiry. The 
second part concerns the adverse observations/remarks 
made in paragraphs 13 and 14. As far as the first part is 
concerned, the appellant cannot make any grievance. The 
appellant’s grievance must be confined only to the second 
part. 
13. In the case of State of U.P. v. Mohd. Naim6, in 
paragraph 11 this Court held thus: 
“11. The last question is, is the present 
case a case of an exceptional nature in 
which the learned Judge should have 
exercised his inherent jurisdiction under 
Section 561-A CrPC in respect of the 
observations complained of by the State 
Government? If there is one principle of 
cardinal importance in the administration 
of justice, it is this: the proper freedom and 
independence of judges and Magistrates 
must be maintained and they must be 

allowed to perform their functions freely 
and 
fearlessly 
and 
without 
undue 
interference by any body, even by this 
Court. At the same time it is equally 
necessary that in expressing their 
opinions Judges and Magistrates must 
be guided by considerations of justice, 
fair-play 
and 
restraint. it 
is 
not 
infrequent 
that 
sweeping 
generalisations defeat the very purpose 
for which they are made. It has been 
judicially recognised that in the matter of 
making 
disparaging 
remarks 
against 
persons or authorities whose conduct 
comes into consideration before courts of 
law in cases to be decided by them, it is 
relevant to consider (a) whether the party 
whose conduct is in question is before the 
court or has an opportunity of explaining 
or defending himself; (b) whether there is 
evidence on record bearing on that 
conduct, justifying the remarks; and (c) 
whether it is necessary for the decision of 
the case, as an integral part thereof, to 
animadvert on that conduct. It has also 
been 
recognised 
that 
judicial 
pronouncements must be judicial in 
nature, and should not normally depart 
from sobriety, moderation and reserve.” 
(emphasis added) 
 
These observations must be borne in mind by every Judge. 

14. In the case of in Re: ‘K’, A Judicial Officer3, in 
paragraphs 7 and 8, this court observed thus: 
“7. A Judge entrusted with the task of 
administering justice should be bold 
and feel fearless while acting judicially 
and giving expression to his views and 
constructing his judgment or order. It 
should be no deterrent to formation and 
expression of an honest opinion and 
acting thereon so long as it is within 
four-corners of law that any action 
taken by a subordinate judicial officer 
is open to scrutiny in judicial review 
before a superior forum with which its 
opinion may not meet approval and the 
superior court may upset his action or 
opinion. 
The 
availability 
of 
such 
fearlessness 
is 
essential 
for 
the 
maintenance of judicial independence. 
However, sobriety, cool, calm and poise 
should be reflected in every action and 
expression of a Judge. 
8. The primary purpose of pronouncing a 
verdict is to dispose of the matter in 
controversy between the parties before it. 
A Judge is not expected to drift away from 
pronouncing upon the controversy, to 
sitting in judgment over the conduct of the 
judicial and quasi-judicial authorities 
whose decisions or orders are put in issue 
before him, and indulge in criticising and 
commenting thereon unless the conduct of 
an authority or subordinate functionary or 
anyone else than the parties comes of 
necessity under review and expression of 
opinion thereon going to the extent of 
commenting 
or 
criticising 
becomes 

necessary as a part of reasoning requisite 
for arriving at a conclusion necessary for 
deciding the main controversy or it 
becomes necessary to have animadverted 
thereon for the purpose of arriving at a 
decision on an issue involved in the 
litigation. This applies with added force 
when the superior court is hearing an 
appeal or revision against an order of a 
subordinate judicial officer and feels 
inclined to animadvert on him. The 
wisdom of a Superior Judge itching for 
making observations on a Subordinate 
Judge before ventilating into expression 
must pause for a moment and read the 
counsel of Cardozo— 
“Write an opinion, and read it a few 
years later when it is dissected in the 
briefs of counsel. You will learn for the 
first time the limitations of the power of 
speech, or, if not those of speech in 
general, at all events your own. All sorts 
of gaps and obstacles and impediments 
will obtrude themselves before your 
gaze, as pitilessly manifest as the 
hazards on a golf course. Sometimes 
you will know that the fault is truly 
yours, in which event you can only 
smite your breast, and pray for 
deliverance thereafter.” 
 
In paragraph 15, this Court specifically dealt with the 
legality of observations made by the High Court against a 
Judicial Officer who was a serving member of the judiciary. 
Paragraphs 15 to 17 are material, which read thus: 

15. In the case at hand we are concerned 
with the observations made by the High 
Court against a judicial officer who is a 
serving member of subordinate judiciary. 
Under the constitutional scheme control 
over the district courts and courts 
subordinate thereto has been vested in the 
High Courts. The control so vested is 
administrative, judicial and disciplinary. 
The role of High Court is also of a friend, 
philosopher and guide of judiciary 
subordinate to it. The strength of power 
is not displayed solely in cracking a 
whip on errors, mistakes or failures; the 
power should be so wielded as to have 
propensity to prevent and to ensure 
exclusion of repetition if committed 
once innocently or unwittingly. “Pardon 
the error but not its repetition”. The power 
to control is not to be exercised solely by 
wielding a teacher's cane; the members of 
subordinate judiciary look up to the High 
Court for the power to control to be 
exercised 
with 
parent-like 
care 
and 
affection. 
The 
exercise 
of 
statutory 
jurisdiction, appellate or revisional and 
the exercise of constitutional power to 
control and supervise the functioning of 
the district courts and courts subordinate 
thereto empowers the High Court to 
formulate an opinion and place it on 
record not only on the judicial working but 
also on the conduct of the judicial officers. 
The existence of power in higher 
echelons 
of 
judiciary 
to 
make 
observations 
even 
extending 
to 
criticism incorporated in judicial orders 
cannot be denied, however, the High 
Courts 
have 
to 
remember 
that 

criticisms and observations touching a 
subordinate 
judicial 
officer 
incorporated 
in 
judicial 
pronouncements 
have 
their 
own 
mischievous infirmities. Firstly, the 
judicial officer is condemned unheard 
which is violative of principles of 
natural 
justice. 
A 
member 
of 
subordinate 
judiciary 
himself 
dispensing justice should not be denied 
this minimal natural justice so as to 
shield 
against 
being 
condemned 
unheard. Secondly, the harm caused by 
such criticism or observation may be 
incapable 
of 
being 
undone. 
Such 
criticism 
of 
the 
judicial 
officer 
contained in a judgment, or 
not, is a pronouncement in open and 
therefore becomes public. The same 
Judge who found himself persuaded, 
sitting on judicial side, to make 
observations guided by the facts of a 
single case against a Subordinate Judge 
may, sitting on administrative side and 
apprised 
of 
overall 
meritorious 
performance of the Subordinate Judge, 
may irretrievably regret his having 
made those observations on judicial 
side, the harming effect whereof even 
he 
himself 
cannot 
remove 
on 
administrative side. Thirdly, human 
nature being what it is, such criticism 
of a judicial officer contained in the 
judgment of a higher court gives the 
litigating party a sense of victory not 
only over his opponent but also over the 
Judge who had decided the case against 
him. This is subversive of judicial 
authority 
of 
the 
deciding 
Judge. 

Fourthly, seeking expunging of the 
observations by a judicial officer by 
filing an appeal or petition of his own 
reduces him to the status of a litigant 
arrayed as a party before the High Court 
or Supreme Court — a situation not 
very happy from the point of view of the 
functioning of the judicial system. May 
be for the purpose of pleading his cause 
he has to take the assistance of a legal 
practitioner and such legal practitioner 
may be one practising before him. Look 
at the embarrassment involved. And 
last but not the least, the possibility of 
a single or casual aberration of an 
otherwise 
honest, 
upright 
and 
righteous Judge being caught unawares 
in the net of adverse observations 
cannot be ruled out. Such an incident 
would have a seriously demoralising 
effect not only on him but also on his 
colleagues. If all this is avoidable why 
should it not be avoided? 
16. We must not be understood as 
meaning 
that 
any 
conduct 
of 
a 
subordinate judicial officer unbecoming of 
him and demanding a rebuff should be 
simply overlooked. But there is an 
alternate safer and advisable course 
available to choose. The conduct of a 
judicial 
officer, 
unworthy 
of 
him, 
having come to the notice of a Judge of 
the High Court hearing a matter on the 
judicial side, the lis may be disposed of 
by pronouncing upon the merits thereof 
as found by him but avoiding in the 
judicial pronouncement criticism of, or 
observations on the “conduct” of the 

subordinate judicial officer who had 
decided 
the 
case 
under 
scrutiny. 
Simultaneously, but separately, in-
office proceedings may be drawn up 
inviting attention of Hon'ble Chief 
Justice to the facts describing the 
conduct of the Subordinate Judge 
concerned by sending a confidential 
letter or note to the Chief Justice. It 
will thereafter be open to the Chief 
Justice to deal with the subordinate 
judicial officer either at his own level or 
through the Inspecting Judge or by 
placing the matter before the full court 
for its consideration. The action so taken 
would all be on the administrative side. 
The Subordinate Judge concerned would 
have an opportunity of clarifying his 
position 
or 
putting 
forth 
the 
circumstances under which he acted. He 
would not be condemned unheard and if 
the decision be adverse to him, it being on 
administrative side, he would have some 
remedy available to him under the law. He 
would not be rendered remediless. 
17. The remarks made in a judicial order 
of the High Court against a member of 
subordinate judiciary even if expunged 
would not completely restitute and restore 
the harmed Judge from the loss of dignity 
and honour suffered by him. In Judges by 
David Pannick (Oxford University Press 
Publication, 1987) a wholesome practise 
finds a mention suggesting an appropriate 
course to be followed in such situations: 
“Lord Hailsham explained that in a 
number of cases, although I seldom told 
the complainant that I had done so, I 

showed the complaint to the Judge 
concerned. I thought it good for him both 
to see what was being said about him 
from the other side of the court, and how 
perhaps a lapse of manners or a 
momentary 
impatience 
could 
undermine confidence in his decision.” 
(emphasis added) 
15. The Courts higher in the judicial hierarchy are 
invested with appellate or revisional jurisdiction to correct 
the errors committed by the courts that are judicially 
subordinate to it. The High Court has jurisdiction under 
Article 227 of the Constitution of India and Section 482 of 
the CrPC to correct the errors committed by the courts 
which are judicially subordinate to it. We must hasten to 
add that no court can be called a “subordinate court”. 
Here, we refer to “subordinate” courts only in the context 
of appellate, revisional or supervisory jurisdiction. The 
superior courts exercising such powers can set aside 
erroneous orders and expunge uncalled and unwarranted 
observations. While doing so, the superior courts can 
legitimately criticise the orders passed by the Trial Courts 
or the Appellate Courts by giving reasons. There can be 
criticism of the errors committed, in some cases, by using 
strong language. However, such observations must always 
be in the context of errors in the impugned orders. While 
doing so, the courts have to show restraint, and adverse 
comments on the personal conduct and calibre of 

the Judicial Officer should be avoided. There is a difference 
between criticising erroneous orders and criticising a 
Judicial Officer. The first part is permissible. The second 
category of criticism should best be avoided. The reasons 
are already explained by this Court in Re: ‘K’, A Judicial 
Officer3. There are five reasons given in paragraph 15 of 
the decision why judicial officers should not be condemned 
unheard. As observed in the decision, the High Court 
Judges, after noticing improper conduct on the part of the 
Judicial Officer, can always invite the attention of the Chief 
Justice on the administrative side to such conduct. 
Whenever action is proposed against a judicial officer on 
the administrative side, he gets the full opportunity to 
clarify and explain his position. But if such personal 
adverse observations are made in a judgment, the Judicial 
Officer’s career gets adversely affected. 
16. The Judges are human beings. All human beings are 
prone to committing mistakes. To err is human. Almost all 
courts in our country are overburdened. In the year 2002, 
in the case of “All India Judges’ Association (3) and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.7, this Court passed an order 
directing that within five years, an endeavour should be 
made to increase the judge-to-population ratio in our trial 
judiciary to 50 per million. However, till the year 2024, we 
 
7 (2002) 

have not even reached the ratio of 25 per million. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
population 
and 
litigation 
have 
substantially increased. The Judges have to work under 
stress. As stated earlier, every Judge, irrespective of his 
post and status, is likely to commit errors. In a given case, 
after writing several sound judgments, a judge may commit 
an error in one judgment due to the pressure of work or 
otherwise. As stated earlier, the higher court can always 
correct the error. However, while doing so, if strictures are 
passed personally against a Judicial Officer, it causes 
prejudice 
to 
the 
Judicial 
Officer, 
apart 
from 
the embarrassment involved. We must remember that 
when we sit in constitutional courts, even we are prone to 
making mistakes. Therefore, personal criticism of Judges 
or recording findings on the conduct of Judges in 
judgments must be avoided. 
17. We have already referred to the observations made in 
paragraphs 13 and 14 of the first impugned order. In 
paragraph 13, it is observed that the appellant ‘embarked 
on an inexorable quest’. This ought to have been avoided 
by the High Court. Paragraph 14 contains advice to the 
appellant to be circumspect and to exercise care and 
caution in future. The High Court could not have used a 
judgment on the judicial side to advise individual Judicial 
Officers. That can only be done on the administrative side 
in an appropriate case. Describing the appellant's 

approach as a ‘judicial misadventure’ in paragraph 14 was 
also improper. Therefore, the prayer made by the appellant 
for expunging remarks in paragraphs 13 and 14, which we 
have quoted in paragraph no.6 above, will have to be 
acceded to. We make it clear that the direction to expunge 
the remarks made against the appellant will not bind the 
administrative side of the High Court. 
18. Accordingly, the appeals are allowed. Adverse 
remarks against the appellant in paragraphs 13 and 14 of 
the first impugned order, which we have quoted in 
paragraph no.6 above, are hereby expunged.
