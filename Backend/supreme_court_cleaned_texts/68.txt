JUDGMENT 
 
Mehta, J. 
 
1. 
Leave granted. 
2. 
Brief facts relevant and essential for disposal of these appeals 
which arise out of proceedings under the Consumer Protection Act, 
1986 are noted hereinbelow:- 
The appellant-complainant P.C. Jain, claims to have lost 
vision in his left eye due to the medical negligence committed by 
the respondent Dr. R.P. Singh in a surgical procedure whereupon 
he instituted a Consumer Complaint No. 115 of 2005 before the 
District 
Consumer 
Disputes 
Redressal 
Commission, 

Faridabad(hereinafter being referred to as “DCDRC”). Vide order 
dated 4th April, 2008, the DCDRC, Faridabad allowed the 
complaint of the appellant-complainant P.C. Jain and granted him 
compensation to the tune of Rs. 2 Lakhs with interest @ 12% p.a. from the date of filing of complaint till the date of realization, 
holding the respondent Dr. R.P. Singh guilty of medical negligence 
in treatment of the appellant-complainant P.C. Jain. 
3. 
The respondent Dr. R.P. Singh, challenged the order dated 4th 
April, 2008 of the DCDRC, Faridabad by way of filing First Appeal 
No. 1493 of 2008 before the State Consumer Disputes Redressal 
Commission, Haryana(hereinafter being referred to as “SCDRC”) 
which was allowed vide order dated 23rd May, 2011 observing that 
since the appellant-complainant P.C. Jain was operated at New 
Delhi, the DCDRC, Faridabad had no territorial jurisdiction to 
entertain and decide the complaint and direct that the amount of 
Rs. 2 Lakhs be refunded to the respondent Dr. R.P. Singh. 
4. 
The appellant-complainant P.C. Jain challenged the order 
dated 23rd May, 2011 passed by the SCDRC by filing a revision 
before 
National 
Consumer 
Disputes 
Redressal 
Commission(hereinafter being referred to as the “NCDRC”), which 

came to be allowed by order dated 29th July, 2016 and the matter 
was remanded back to SCDRC for fresh decision on merits. 
5. 
The SCDRC, vide order dated 6th July, 2017 again allowed the 
appeal filed by respondent Dr. R.P. Singh and dismissed the 
Complaint No. 115 of 2005. 
6. 
The appellant-complainant P.C. Jain challenged the order 
dated 6th July, 2017 passed by the SCDRC by filing fresh Revision 
Petition No. 3446 of 2017 before the NCDRC which accepted the 
same vide order dated 18th May, 2022. The judgment of SCDRC 
was reversed and it was held that the compensation awarded by 
the DCDRC to appellant-complainant P.C. Jain to the tune of Rs.2 
Lakhs was just and proper. However, the interest @ 12% was held 
to be excessive and accordingly, the same was reduced to 6%. The 
order passed by SCDRC was set aside. 
7. 
The respondent Dr. R.P. Singh filed a review petition seeking 
clarification of the order dated 18th May, 2022. The said review 
application was taken on board and allowed ex-parte vide order 
dated 22nd July, 2022 accepting the unilateral version of 
respondent Dr. R.P. Singh that he had deposited an amount of 
Rs.2 Lakhs on 5th September, 2008 before the SCDRC and 
thereafter, vide order dated 23rd May, 2011, the deposited amount 

was released in favour of the appellant-complainant. A 
clarificatory order dated 22nd July, 2022 was accordingly issued 
observing that the respondent Dr. R.P. Singh was liable to pay 
interest from the date of filing of the complaint upto 5th September, 
2008 only. 
8. 
Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the appellant-
complainant preferred a, before 
the NCDRC, objecting to the ex-parte order dated 22nd July, 2022. 
However, the said review application was rejected by NCDRC vide 
order dated 26th September, 2022. The appellant-complainant 
P.C. Jain has assailed these three orders dated 18th May, 2022, 
22nd July, 2022 and 26th September, 2022 in Civil Appeals (Civil) Nos. 683-685 of 2023 whereas the respondent Dr. R.P. 
Singh has preferred Civil Appeals (Civil) Nos.13511-13512 of 
2023 challenging the orders dated 18th May, 2022 and 22nd July, 
2022 passed by NCDRC. 
9. 
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone 
through the material available on record. 
10. It is relevant to note here that the Ethics Committee of 
Medical Council of India(hereinafter being referred to as ‘MCI’) 
conducted an enquiry and passed an order dated 20th December, 

2012 holding Dr. R.P. Singh to be in violation of Professional 
Misconduct, Etiquette and Ethics Regulation, 2002. 
11. The competent authority, i.e., the MCI vide order dated 20th 
April, 2015 held the respondent Dr. R.P. Singh guilty of medical 
negligence in the treatment of the appellant-complainant P.C. Jain 
and affirmed the recommendation of the Ethics Committee 
removing his name from the Indian Medical Register for a period 
of six months. 
12. On going through the pleadings of civil appeals preferred by 
the respondent Dr. R.P. Singh, it becomes clear that the said order 
issued by MCI was not challenged by the respondent Dr. R.P. 
Singh and thus, has attained finality. 
13. In the background of the aforesaid facts, the issue regarding 
the respondent Dr. R.P. Singh having committed medical 
negligence in treating the appellant-complainant P.C. Jain is no 
longer res integra. Consequently, the order dated 18th May, 2022 
whereby the revision preferred by the appellant-complainant P.C. 
Jain was accepted, the order of SCDRC was reversed and the order 
of the DCDRC was affirmed, does not warrant any interference in 
the appeals preferred by Dr. R.P. Singh. 

14. Now, we propose to consider the prayers made in Civil 
Appeals (Civil) No(s). 683-685 of 2023 filed by appellant-
complainant P.C. Jain. 
15. The appellant-complainant P.C. Jain who is 84 years of age 
as on date claims to have suffered loss of vision in the left eye owing 
to the gross medical negligence committed by respondent-Dr. R.P. 
Singh in a surgical procedure which was undertaken way back in 
the year 2002-2003. He has been contesting this long drawn out 
litigation for a rightful claim of compensation for more than 20 
years. The NCDRC, while accepting the revision of the appellant-
complainant P.C. Jain, reduced the interest awarded by the 
DCDRC from 12% to 6%, with a bald unreasoned observation that 
the rate of interest so applied was on the higher side and, therefore, 
the same was reduced to 6%. 
16. The respondent Dr. R.P. Singh misrepresented to the NCDRC 
that he had deposited an amount of Rs. 2 Lakhs only, which had 
been paid to the appellant-complainant P.C. Jain in the year 2011. 
As a matter of fact, it is the specific plea of the appellant P.C. Jain 
that he has not received a single penny towards compensation for 
the loss of vision suffered by him owing to the medical negligence 
committed by the respondent Dr. R.P. Singh. The review petition 

filed by Dr. R.P. Singh was allowed ex-parte by the NCDRC in a 
totally cavalier fashion without putting the complainant to notice. 
17. In wake of the discussion made hereinabove, we modify the 
orders passed by the NCDRC and direct that the appellant P.C. 
Jain shall be entitled to receive compensation of Rs. 2 Lakhs only 
with interest @ 12% per annum from the respondent Dr. R.P. Singh 
with effect from the date of filing of the complaint till actual 
payment is made. 
18. The respondent Dr. R.P. Singh shall pay the compensation as 
directed above to the appellant-complainant within two months 
from today failing which the interest shall stand enhanced to 15% 
per annum. 
19. As the respondent Dr. R.P. Singh procured the order under 
review dated 22nd July, 2022 by making a false representation that 
the amount of compensation had been paid to the appellant-
complainant P.C. Jain, we impose a cost of Rs. 50,000/- upon the 
respondent Dr. R.P. Singh which upon realisation, shall be paid to 
the appellant-complainant P.C. Jain. 
20. As a consequence of the above discussion, the Civil Appeals 
(Civil) Nos. 683-685 of 2023 filed by the appellant-

complainant P.C. Jain stand allowed and the Civil Appeals (Civil) Nos. 13511-13512 of 2023 filed by the respondent Dr. 
R.P. Singh stand rejected. 
21. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of..………………………………J.
