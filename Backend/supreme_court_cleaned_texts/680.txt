2. 
Without going into detailed facts, it would be 
relevant to quote an order dated 19.07.2022 
passed by this Court in the above two writ 
petitions, as the said order incorporates the 
crux of the matter: 
 
“Issue notice. 
 
Mr. Arvind Kumar Sharma, learned Advocate-
on-Record accepts notice on behalf of the Union 
of India and Ministry of Defence. 
 
These Writ Petitions under Article 32 of the 
Constitution of India, have been filed by the 

WRIT PETITION (CRL) NOS. 265 & 250 OF 2022 

wives of officers of the Indian Army for quashing 
of Suo Moto FIR, bearing State Crime Police 
Station (SCPS) Case No.07/2021 registered 
against the personnel of 21 PARA(SF), Unit of the 
Indian Army including the respective husbands 
of the Writ Petitioners under Sections 302, 307, 
326, 201, 34 read with Section 120-B of the 
Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) the findings and 
recommendations of the Special Investigation 
Team (SIT) dated 24th March 2022 constituted 
by Respondent No.2. The proceedings in this 
case emanate out of an incident dated 4th 
December 2021 which led to a firing in which 6 
persons were killed. The incident flared up 
leading to more killings and also killing of one of 
the Army personnel. It is stated that a finger of 
the husband of Anjali Gupta, the Writ Petitioner 
in, was also 
chopped off. 
 
The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 
is applicable to the place in Nagaland where the 
incident took place, as stated by the learned 
Additional Solicitor General. 
 
Section 6 of the Armed Forces 
(Special Powers) Act, 1958 reads as 
under:- “Protection to persons acting 
under Act.- No prosecution, suit or other 
legal proceedings shall be instituted except 
with the previous sanction of the Central 
Government, against any person in respect 
of anything done or purported to be done 
in exercise of the powers conferred by this 
Act.” 
 
From 
the 
report 
bearing 
No. 
PHQ/IGP/CID/SCPS/CN0/07/2021/25 dated 
Kohima, 
24th 
March 

of 
the 
Chief 
Investigation Officer being the range IGP, it 
appears that sanction of prosecution is to be 
obtained under Section 197(2) of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr.P.C.) and Section 

WRIT PETITION (CRL) NOS. 265 & 250 OF 2022 

6 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958. 
The 
Section 
197(2) 
of 
the 
Cr.P.C. has 
inadvertently been typed as Section 197(2) of the 
IPC in the said report of the Chief Investigation 
Officer. 
 
Section 197(2) of the Cr.P.C. applies to taking 
cognizance by the Court. However, Section 6 of 
the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 
clearly provides, no prosecution, suit or other 
legal proceedings shall be instituted except with 
the 
previous 
sanction 
of 
the 
Central 
Government. 
 
On the query of this Court, the learned 
Additional Solicitor General submitted that no 
previous sanction has been granted by the 
Central Government. The question of sanction is 
awaiting consideration at the appropriate level. 
 
In view of the admitted position that 
mandatory previous sanction as required under 
Section 6 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) 
Act, 1958 has not been obtained, we are 
constrained to pass an interim order staying 
further proceedings pursuant to FIR No. 27 of 
2021/Final Report of the Special Investigation 
Team/Chargesheet. 
 
In the past, this Court has entertained similar 
Writ Petitions filed by close family members of 
officers of the Indian Army including Writ 
Petition (Crl.) No. 36/2018 (Vineet Dhanda vs. 
Union of India & Ors.) and Writ Petitioner (Crl.) 
No.42 of 2018 (Lt. Col. Karamveer Singh vs. The 
State of Jammu and Kashmir & Others). The 
copies of the orders in the aforesaid writ petitions 
are annexed to the writ petition. 
 
List the matters after eight weeks.” 

WRIT PETITION (CRL) NOS. 265 & 250 OF 2022 

3. 
Thereafter, on 07.03.2024, Ms. Aishwarya 
Bhati, learner Additional Solicitor General, 
informed this Court that the sanction under 
Section 6 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) 
Act, 19581 has since been declined by 
competent 
authority, 
vide 
order 
dated 
28.02.2023. When this Court expressed its view 
that it was quashing the FIRs in view of the 
rejection of the sanction, the learned Advocate 
General for the State of Nagaland, Mr. K.N. 
Balgopal insisted on filing an affidavit and 
praying for time to do the needful. With 
hesitation, this Court granted time to the 
Advocate General. The order dated 07.03.2024 
is reproduced hereunder: 
 
“There is already an interim order operating in 
favour of the petitioners. Ms. Bhati, learned ASG, 
upon instructions, states that the sanction has 
since been rejected by the competent authority 
on 28th February, 2023. As such we were 
inclined to close these matters. 
 
However, learned counsel appearing for the 
State of Nagaland insisted that he has to file an 
affidavit and has prayed for three weeks’ time. 
 
Time, as prayed for, is granted. 
 
1 In short, the AFSP Act, 1958 

WRIT PETITION (CRL) NOS. 265 & 250 OF 2022 

The affidavit may be served upon the learned 
counsel for the petitioners as well as on the 
Union of India by 1st April, 2024. 
 
List these matters on 5th April, 2024.” 
 
4. 
The matter has since remained pending, and 
arguments were heard on 6th August, 2024. The 
learned Senior Counsels and counsels for the 
parties 
had 
made 
submissions 
making 
allegations and counter-allegations. However, 
we 
are 
not 
inclined 
to 
go 
into 
those 
submissions, as in our view, in view of the 
specific bar contained in Section 6 of the AFSP 
Act, 1958 which provides that no prosecution, 
suit, or other legal proceedings can be instituted 
except with the previous sanction of the Central 
Government with respect to the exercise of any 
power conferred under the said Act, the 
proceedings based on the impugned FIRs 
cannot continue any further. The interim order, 
granted by the order dated 19.07.2022, 
deserves to be made absolute, and the 
proceedings arising from the impugned FIRs 
deserve to be quashed. 
5. 
However, there is one aspect of the matter that 
needs consideration. The learned Advocate 

WRIT PETITION (CRL) NOS. 265 & 250 OF 2022 

General for the State of Nagaland, Mr. K.N. 
Balgopal submitted that the State has already 
assailed the correctness of the order dated 28th 
February, 2023, passed by the competent 
authority, declining sanction under Section 6 of 
the AFSP Act, 1958, by way of filing Writ Petition 
(, titled The 
State of Nagaland vs. Ministry of Defence & 
Anr., 
instituted 
before 
this 
Court 
on 
16.04.2024. He submitted that if the said writ 
petition is allowed, and the rejection of sanction 
is set aside and this Court either grants 
sanction or for fresh decision by the competent 
authority, which may ultimately result into a 
sanction under Section 6 of the AFSP Act, 1958 
for continuing the proceedings, then the 
proceedings pursuant to the impugned FIRs 
may proceed in accordance with law and may be 
carried to their logical conclusion. We have no 
manner of doubt that, in case, if ultimately at 
some stage, sanction is granted under Section 6 
of the AFSP Act, 1958, the proceedings 
pursuant to the impugned FIRs are liable to be 
continued. 

WRIT PETITION (CRL) NOS. 265 & 250 OF 2022 

6. 
As such, we make it clear that if such situation 
arises, at any stage of sanction being granted 
under Section 6 of the AFSP Act, 1958, the 
proceedings pursuant to the impugned FIRs 
would continue according to law and may take 
its own course as provided under law. 
7. 
Mr. K.N. Balgopal had also placed heavy 
reliance on the affidavit filed on behalf of the 
Armed 
Forces 
before 
the 
Chief 
Judicial 
Magistrate, in which observations were made 
that they were likely to proceed on the 
departmental side administratively, and as 
such, directions may be issued to the Armed 
Forces to carry on the said exercise. The said 
submission does not merit consideration by this 
Court as that would be at the sole discretion of 
the Armed Forces whether or not to carry on 
disciplinary proceedings against its officers. As 
such, we are not inclined to issue any such 
directions. The concerned wing of the Armed 
Forces would be at liberty to take or not to take 
any disciplinary proceedings against its officers. 
 
8. 
In view of the aforesaid discussions, the Writ 
Petition (Criminal) Nos. 265 of 2022 and 250 of 

WRIT PETITION (CRL) NOS. 265 & 250 OF 2022 

2022 are allowed. The proceedings pursuant to 
the impugned FIRs shall remain closed. 
However, in case sanction is granted at any 
stage under Section 6 of the AFSP Act, 1958, the 
proceedings pursuant to the impugned FIRs 
may continue and may proceed in accordance 
with law and be brought to a logical conclusion.
