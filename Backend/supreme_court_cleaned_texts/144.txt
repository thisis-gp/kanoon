RPC 1036/2023
this Court by its judgment in Union of India vs Lieutenant Commander
Annie Nagaraja3. The review petitioner was one of the officers before this
Court. The submissions which were urged on her behalf were set out in
paragraph 52 of the judgment. 

In order to appreciate the grievance in the review petition, a reference to
some of the salient facts would be in order. The petitioner was commissioned
in the Indian Navy as a Short Service Commissioned Officer4 in the Judge
Advocate Generals’5 Branch of the Indian Navy on 6 August 2007. She was
promoted on 6 August 2009 as a Lieutenant and, thereafter, on 6 August
2012 as a Lieutenant Commander. During the course of her service, she was
granted an extension in November 2016 for a period of two years and,
thereafter, for an equivalent duration in August 2018. On 5 August 2020, the
petitioner was informed that she would stand released from service on 5
August 2021.

The judgment of this Court in Lieutenant Commander Annie Nagaraja
case (supra) was rendered by this Court on 17 March 2020. The directions
which were issued by this Court would be of relevance to the present case
and are hence set out below:
“109.1. The statutory bar on the engagement or enrolment of
women in the Indian Navy has been lifted to the extent

4 “SSCO”
5 “JAG”

RPC 1036/2023
envisaged in the Notifications issued by the Union Government
on 9-10-1991 and 6-11-1998 under Section 9(2) of the 1957
Act.
109.2. By and as a result of the policy decision of the Union
Government in the Ministry of Defence dated 25-2-1999, the
terms and conditions of service of SSC officers, including
women in regard to the grant of PCs are governed by
Regulation 203, Chapter IX, Part III of the 1963 Regulations.
109.3. The stipulation in the Policy Letter dated 26-9-2008
making it prospective and restricting its application to specified
cadres/branches of the Indian Navy shall not be enforced.
109.4. The provisions of the implementation guidelines dated
3-12-2008, to the extent that they are made prospective and
restricted to specified cadres are quashed and set aside.
109.5. All SSC officers in the Education, Law and Logistics
cadres who are presently in service shall be considered for the
grant of PCs. The right to be considered for the grant of PCs
arises from the Policy Letter dated 25-2-1999 read with
Regulation 203 of Chapter IX Part III of the 1963 Regulations.
SSC women officers in the batch of cases before the High Court
and AFT, who are presently in service shall be considered for
the grant of PCs on the basis of the vacancy position as on the
date of judgments of the Delhi High Court and AFT or as it
presently stands, whichever is higher.
109.6. The period of service after which women SSC officers
shall be entitled to submit applications for the grant of PCs
shall be the same as their male counterparts.
109.7. The applications of the serving officers for the grant of
PCs shall be considered on the basis of the norms contained in
Regulation 203 namely: (I) availability of vacancies in the
stabilised cadre at the material time; (ii) determination of
suitability; and (iii) recommendation of the Chief of the Naval
Staff. Their empanelment shall be based on inter se merit
evaluated on the ACRs of the officers under consideration,
subject to the availability of vacancies.
109.8. SSC officers who are found suitable for the grant of PC
shall be entitled to all consequential benefits including arrears
of pay, promotions and retiral benefits as and when due.

RPC 1036/2023
109.9. Women SSC officers of the ATC cadre in Annie Nagaraja
case [Annie Nagaraja v. Union of India, 2015 SCC OnLine Del
11804] are not entitled to consideration for the grant of PCs
since neither men nor women SSC officers are considered for
the grant of PCs and there is no direct induction of men officers
to PCs. In exercise of the power conferred by Article 142 of the
Constitution, we direct that as a one-time measure, SSC
officers in the ATC cadre in Annie Nagaraja case [Annie
Nagaraja v. Union of India, 2015 SCC OnLine Del 11804] shall
be entitled to pensionary benefits. SSC officers in the ATC cadre
in Priya Khurana case [Priya Khurana v. Union of India, ], being inducted in pursuance of the
specific representation contained in the advertisements
pursuant to which they were inducted, shall be considered for
the grant of PCs in accordance with Directions 109.5 and 109.6
above.
109.10. All SSC women officers who were denied consideration
for the grant of PCs on the ground that they were inducted
prior to the issuance of the Letter dated 26-9-2008 and who are
not presently in service shall be deemed, as a one-time
measure, to have completed substantive pensionable service.
Their pensionary benefits shall be computed and released on
this basis. No arrears of salary shall be payable for the period
after release from service.
109.11. As a one-time measure, all SSC women officers who
were before the High Court and AFT who are not granted PCs
shall be deemed to have completed substantive qualifying
service for the grant of pension and shall be entitled to all
consequential benefits.”

The petitioner was an officer who was recruited before the Policy Letter 6 of
26 September 2008 was issued. The PL stipulated that while women SSCOs
would be considered for grant of PC in stipulated branches (JAG, Education
and Naval Architecture), the letter would have prospective effect. It was as a
result of the application of the PL dated 26 September 2008 that the
6 “PL”

RPC 1036/2023
petitioner was initially not considered to be eligible for the grant of PC. In the
directions contained in paragraph 109.1 and 109.2, extracted above, this
Court noted that the statutory bar on the enrolment of women in the Indian
Navy was lifted in terms of the notifications issued by the Union Government
on 9 October 1991 and 6 November 1998 under Section 9(2) of the Navy Act.
Moreover, this Court held that the policy decision of the Union Government
dated 25 February 1999 would govern the conditions of service of SSCOs
including women officers in regard to the grant of PCs in terms of Regulation
203 Chapter IX Part III of the 1963 Regulations. 

Having come to the above conclusion, this Court specifically directed that the
PL dated 26 September 2008, making it prospective and restricting it to
specified cadres, would stand quashed and set aside. This Court directed that
all SSCOs in the Education, Law and Logistic Cadres who were “presently in
service”, shall be considered for the grant of PC. This entitlement arose from
the PL dated 25 February 1999 read with Regulation 203 of Chapter IX of the
Naval Regulations 1963. 

It is not in dispute that the case of the petitioner for being considered for the
grant of PC squarely arose in terms of the directions contained in paragraph
109.5 of the judgment. The petitioner was considered for the grant of PC
after the judgment of this Court, but has been denied PC on the ground that
there were no vacancies. 

RPC 1036/2023

The petitioner had earlier moved this Court under Article 32 of the
Constitution, but was relegated to the Armed Forces Tribunal7 by an order
dated 24 August 2021. When the petitioner moved the AFT, the Tribunal
issued certain directions in its judgment dated 3 January 2022. The AFT, inter
alia, issued the following directions:
“122(a)
Respondents to identify and generate a proportional
number of vacancies as a onetime measure to give a fair and
viable consideration to the overborne cadres including
Exec/Law, Exec/GS, Exec/NAI which required vacancies for fair
consideration in Dec 2020. The following applicants in this
batch of cases be then considered afresh in their own batches,
along with those who were in service on 17.03.2020:

Cdr Seema Chaudhary, Exec/Law, in OA 1972/2021.

Cdr Raja Kanwar, Exec/GS, in OA 1965/2021.
(iii) Cdr Bhupesh Kumar, Exec/GS, in OA 1966/2021.
122(d)
Considering the peculiarities of Law cadre, eligible
SSC Law cadre officers of 2011 and 2014 batches who also
ought to have been considered in Selection Board Dec 2020, be
now considered along with Cdr Seema Chaudhary (applicant in
OA 1972/2021) in the fresh consideration directed to be
undertaken.”

The above directions formed the subject matter of challenge before this
Court in. 

The batch of civil appeals including the above civil appeal by the petitioner
came to be disposed of by this Court by its order dated 20 October 2022.
7 “AFT”

RPC 1036/2023
From the judgment of this Court, it has emerged that the principal
submission before this Court was that the AFT had relied on certain
information which had been placed in a sealed cover to which the officers
before it were not privy. Based on the submission, this Court restored the
proceedings back to the AFT.

Mr Devadatt Kamat, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner
submits that inadvertently the specific facts of the case of the petitioner
were not drawn to the attention of the Court. It has been submitted that the
issue pertaining to the breach of the principles of natural justice did not arise
in the case of the review petitioner since her case stood on a distinct
foundation.

During the course of the hearing, Mr R Balasubramanian, senior counsel
appearing on behalf of the Naval authorities and the Union of India does not
dispute the factual position that the issue which was dealt with in the
judgment of this Court dated 20 October 2022 did not arise in the appeal
which was filed by the petitioner against the judgment of the AFT. 

That being the position, we are of the view that the ends of justice would
require that the order which was passed by this Court on 20 October 2022 in
 pertaining to the petitioner, should be recalled.
We order accordingly. We have accordingly heard the civil appeal on merits in
order to ensure that a final resolution is brought to the matter. 

RPC 1036/2023

The facts as they have been set out in the earlier part of this judgment
indicate that the petitioner is a JAG Branch officer recruited on Short Service
Commission in 2007. Clearly, therefore, she was recruited at a time when the
PL dated 25 February 1999 held the field. The subsequent PL dated 26
September 2008 which was prospective in nature was specifically dealt with
in the judgment of this Court in Lieutenant Commander Annie Nagaraja
case. The Court directed that the PL which made it prospective and confined
to certain specific branches would not be enforced. In other words, the case
of the petitioner for being considered for the grant of PC was squarely
required to be dealt with in terms of the position as it stood independent of
the PL dated 26 September 2008.

The submission which has been urged on behalf of the petitioner is that the
directions which have been issued by the AFT in its impugned order dated 3
January 2022 are contrary to the binding directions of this Court in its
judgment in Lieutenant Commander Annie Nagaraja. This submission
has been advanced on the ground that the petitioner who was an in-service
officer on the date of the judgment in Lieutenant Commander Annie
Nagaraja was required to be considered in terms of the directions issued by
this Court. However, the AFT in its impugned judgment dated 3 January
2022, directed that the petitioner should be considered together with officers
drawn from the 2011 and 2014 batches on the ground that they ought to
have been also considered in the Selection Board in December 2020. It has

RPC 1036/2023
been submitted that this direction for the petitioner to be considered
together with the officers of later batches, namely, 2011 and 2014 has
caused serious prejudice to her.

Mr R Balasubramanian, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Union of
India, on the other hand, submits that such a consideration with subsequent
batches was made in order to ensure that a fair opportunity was granted to
all concerned officers and to widen the field of consideration. 

There is merit in the challenge to the direction which has been issued by the
AFT requiring that the candidature of the petitioner for the grant of PC should
be dealt with the batches of 2011 and 2014. To do so would amount to
introducing a condition which was not a part of the judgment of this Court in
Lieutenant Commander Annie Nagaraja. The binding judgment, which
has to be enforced is the decision of this Court in Lieutenant Commander
Annie Nagaraja. Any directions de-hors the judgment of the Court could not
obviously be issued. Though the case of the petitioner has been considered
after the decision in Lieutenant Commander Annie Nagaraja, there is a
serious element of prejudice which has been caused to the petitioner which
must be rectified so as to enforce the final directions of this Court. 

We accordingly order and direct that in the peculiar facts and circumstances
of this case, the case of the petitioner for the grant of PC shall be considered
afresh by reconvening a Selection Board. The Selection Board shall consider

RPC 1036/2023
the case of the petitioner on a stand alone basis since it is common ground
that she was the only serving JAG Branch officer of the 2007 batch whose
case for the grant of PC was required to be considered. The consideration by
the Selection Board shall take place uninfluenced by any previous
consideration of her case for PC and uninfluenced by any observations
contained in the order of the AFT.

We however clarify that in the event that pursuant to the directions of the
AFT, if a proportional increase in the vacancies is required to be created to
accommodate the petitioner, this shall be carried out without creating any
precedent for the future. We have issued this direction under Article 142 of
the Constitution so as to ensure that while no other officer is displaced, a
long standing injustice to the petitioner is duly rectified. 

Any Annual Confidential Report which has not been communicated to the
petitioner shall not be considered for the purpose of the grant of PC. 

The exercise of considering the petitioner afresh for PC shall be carried out
on or before 15 April 2024. 

Should the petitioner be aggrieved by any further decision that is taken, she
shall be at liberty to pursue her remedies in accordance with law. It is
understood by both the petitioner, who is personally present before the
Court, as well as the counsel for the Naval authorities that all pending
proceedings before the AFT relating to the petitioner shall stand disposed of

RPC 1036/2023
in view of the present directions.

The Review Petition is accordingly disposed of. 

Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
