IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA 
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
 
CIVIL APPEAL NO. of 2024 
 SLP (C) No. 15788 of 2021 

S.D. MANOHARA...APPELLANT(S) 
 
VERSUS 
 
KONKAN RAILWAY CORPORATION 
LIMITED & ORS. 

JUDGMENT 
PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J. 
1. 
Leave granted. 
2. 
The adjudication in this case is intended to resolve a long 
standing service dispute between the parties, rather than to lay 
down any precedent of law. 
3. 
The short facts necessary for resolution of this dispute revolve 
around the invariable question that arises in disputes involving 
withdrawal of the resignation letter1, i.e. whether the employee 
 
1 Resignation can be withdrawn before its acceptance, is an established principle of law; Suman v. 
Jain v. Marwadi Sammelan,; Air India Express Limited v. Captain 
Gurdarshan Kaur Sandhu, (2019); Srikantha S.M. v. Bharath Earth Movers Limited, 
(2005); Balram Gupta v. Union of India, 1987 Supp SCC 228; Union of India v. Gopal 
Chandra Misra (1978). has withdrawn his resignation before its acceptance by the 
employer or not. Having examined the matter in detail, we have 
arrived at the conclusion that resignation was in fact 
withdrawn before its acceptance. We have thus allowed the 
appeal and directed reinstatement of the appellant. Further, 
to balance equities, we ordered the salary payable for the period 
that the appellant has not worked to be restricted to 50% of the 
salary payable for the said period. 
4. 
The appellant has been in service of the respondent since 1990. 
After having put in 13 years of service, he tendered his 
resignation on 05.12.2013 stating that it may be considered as 
coming into effect on expiry of one month. On the question 
whether this resignation letter was withdrawn before its 
acceptance, there are a number of letters and instances cited 
by the appellant and the respondent as well, but the crucial 
letters that would clinch the issue are just four in number. 
5. 
The respondent states that the letter of resignation was 
accepted on 15.04.2014 w.e.f from 07.04.2014. Respondent 
further states that the appellant sought to withdraw his 
resignation dated 05.12.2013 only on 26.05.2014, which could 
not be accepted and therefore, they have rejected the request 
on 23.06.2014 and relieved the appellant w.e.f. 01.07.2014. 

5.1 On the other hand, the appellant’s primary submission was 
that the letter dated 15.04.2014 was never issued to him. It 
was only an internal communication of the respondent. He 
further 
submits 
that 
the 
said 
communication 
dated 
15.04.2014 was not even marked to the appellant and it has 
no reference to appellant’s resignation letter dated 05.12.2013. 
That, it is an internal communication is also evidenced by the 
fact that it does not fix any date for relieving, instead it directed 
necessary action like no dues certificate etc. to be given to the 
appellant before relieving him. Importantly, the appellant 
fortifies his case by stating that he continued in service despite 
the initial letter dated 05.12.2013 and had in fact reported on 
19.05.2014. He relied on letter dated 10.05.2014 issued by the 
respondent directing him to report to duty pursuant to his 
application dated 24.04.2014 for casual leave for two days i.e. for 25th and 26th of April 2014. He also relied on letters of his 
wife dated 17.04.2014 and 20.05.2014 requesting the 
respondent not to accept her husband’s resignation. A 
certificate of competency issued by the respondent stating that 
the appellant is competent to take the Engineering Block is also 
relied on by the respondent employer. 

6. 
Questioning the letter dated 23.06.2014, formally rejecting his 
withdrawal, the appellant filed a 
(S-RES) before the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru. The 
learned Single Judge by its judgment dated 16.07.2019 allowed 
the Writ Petition and directed reinstatement of the appellant 
with all benefits. Challenging the said order of the Single Judge, 
the respondent filed a (S-RES) 
before the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru which was 
allowed by the Division Bench by the order impugned before 
us. 
7. 
The analysis and decision of the Division Bench is confined to 
just two paragraphs in the otherwise long judgment. 
Paragraphs 5 and 21 of the judgment are as under:- 
“5…. 
Here in the instant case, the resignation was not 
immediately accepted as sought for by the petitioner on 
expiry of one month. The resignation which was 
submitted on 05.12.2013 was accepted with effect 
from 07.04.2014. This was communicated to the 
petitioner on 15.04.2014 with a relieving date. The 
letter to withdraw the resignation was made on 
26.05.2014. 
The 
petitioner 
was 
communicated 
rejection of his request to withdraw the resignation 
only on 23.06.2014. The petitioner was relieved on the 
basis of the said communication on 01.07.2014 and 
official order was issued on 15.07.2014…. In the 
present case, the resignation was not accepted as 
sought for by the petitioner at the expiry of one month 
from 05.12.2013 and he was allowed to work till he 
was relieved only on 01.07.2014 with office order 
issued on 15.07.2014…” 

7.1 Again in the concluding paragraph no. 21, the Division Bench 
of the High Court held as under:- 
“21. In the light of the above discussion, this Court is 
of the opinion that the employer was justified in 
rejecting the request made by the respondent-
employee in respect of withdrawal of resignation as his 
resignation dated 05.12.2013 was accepted with 
effect from 07.04.2014 and the application for 
withdrawal was submitted on 26.05.2014, i.e. after 
expiry of the period on which the resignation came into 
force.” 

8. 
Questioning the correctness of the decision of the High Court 
the appellant filed the present appeal, and this Court issued 
notice on 29.10.2021. We heard Mr. Basavaprabhu S. Patil, 
Senior Advocate assisted by Mr. Anirudh Sanganeria, AOR and 
Mr. Samarth Kashyap, Advocate on behalf of the appellant. We 
also heard Mr. Atul Yeshwant Chitale, Senior Advocate assisted 
by Mr. Madhav Atul Chitale, Mr. Nirbhay Singh, Advocates, 
Mrs. Suchitra Atul Chitale, AOR and Mr. Sauryapratapsinh 
Barhat, Advocate on behalf of the respondents. 
9. 
At the outset, we may record that, even assuming that the 
appellant withdrew resignation letter dated 05.12.2013 on 
26.05.2014, it is just about five months in a long service of 24 
years in the Indian Railways. Between these two admitted 
dates, lie the competing and highly contested claims of parties 
that the resignation is either withdrawn or not withdrawn 

before its acceptance. Our enquiry is confined to finding this 
fact. 
10. The respondent-employer strongly relies on the letter of 
acceptance of resignation dated 15.04.2014 and submits that 
it has come into effect from 07.04.2014. We are inclined to 
accept the submission made by the appellant that the letter 
dated 15.04.2014 is an internal communication. There is no 
clear evidence about the service of such letter on the appellant. 
Further, it is also not denied that the appellant has been 
continuously in touch with the respondent. There is no reason 
as to why the respondent-Corporation would write a letter on 
10.05.2014 requesting the appellant to report to duty for 
considering his unauthorised absence from 28.04.2014 to 
18.05.2014. 
11. It is an admitted fact that the appellant has in fact reported to 
duty on 19.05.2014. There is also the communication of the 
appellants wife on 17.04.2014 and 20.05.2014 requesting that 
the resignation dated 05.12.2013 should not be accepted by 
the respondents. As stated earlier, there is also the letter dated 
10.05.2014 of the respondent asking the appellant to report on 
duty 
for 
considering 
his 
unauthorised 
absence 
from 
28.04.2014 to 18.05.2014 which gives an indication that there 

was no finality to the letter of resignation dated 05.12.2013. 
The learned single Judge was correct in his conclusion that the 
resignation was withdrawn before its acceptance. The relevant 
portion of the single Judge order is as under:- 
“13. In the present case, the resignation which was 
submitted on 05.12.2013 with a request to accept it at the 
expiry of one month was stated to have been accepted only 
on 15.04.2014. There is undue delay in accepting the 
resignation by the respondents. In the above decision, the 
delay of mere 13 days in communicating acceptance of the 
resignation, is held to be not an undue delay so as to infer 
that resignation had not already been accepted. Therefore, 
the decision in Vedpathi Dinesh Kumar’s case is also of no 
help to the respondents. 
 
14. In the circumstances, I am of the view that petitioner 
having submitted his letter dated 26.5.2014 seeking to 
withdraw the resignation much before the effective date, 
01.07.2014 with official order on 15.07.2014 by which the 
petitioner was relieved of his duties, withdrawal of 
resignation ought to have been accepted by the respondents 
and continued the petitioner in service. The contrary 
decision by the respondents by the communication dated 
23.06.2014 that withdrawal of resignation is not accepted 
and decision accepting the resignation stands good, is not 
sustainable in law….” 

12. In our opinion, the decision of the Single Judge is correct, and 
the Division Bench committed an error in not eschewing the 
communication dated 15.04.2014 from consideration. 
13. In view of the above, and in the facts and the circumstances of 
the case, we allow the appeal and set-aside the judgment of the 
Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka in Bengaluru in 
 (S-RES). 

13.1 In the facts and circumstances of the case, we direct that the 
appellant shall be reinstated into service within thirty days 
from the date of our order. He shall however be entitled to 
receive 50 percent of salary for the period he is said to have 
been relieved from service i.e. from 01.07.2014 under letter 
dated 23.06.2014 to the date of reinstatement, pursuant to our 
orders. The amount shall be calculated and paid within a 
period of two months from today. This period shall however be 
counted for pensionary benefits, if any. 
13.2 Parties shall bear their own costs.
