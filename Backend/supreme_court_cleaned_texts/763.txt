VISHU KUMAR & ORS. 

 …RESPONDENTS 

JUDGMENT 

ABHAY S. OKA, J. 
 
1. 
Leave granted. 
 
FACTUAL ASPECT 
2. 
The 4th respondent is a Co-operative Bank. The 1st, 2nd, 
5th and 6th respondents had taken a business loan of 
Rs.25,00,000/- from the 4th respondent. 7th to 9th respondents 
guaranteed re-payment of the said loan. 
3. 
As the 1st, 2nd, 5th and 6th respondents committed defaults 
in payment of instalments, the 4th respondent bank filed a 
dispute before the 3rd respondent for recovery of the loan 
amount with interest. The 3rd respondent is the Assistant 

Registrar of Co-operative Societies and Recovery Officer. The 
dispute was allowed. The 4th respondent was held entitled to a 
sum of Rs.21,92,942/- with further interest and costs from the 
borrowers. In recovery proceedings, on 10th June 2019, a sale 
proclamation was issued by the 3rd respondent for the sale of 
property held by the 1st and 2nd respondents. The value of the 
property subject matter of auction was fixed at Rs.80,67,500/-. The sale proclamation of the auction sale fixed on 22nd July 
2019 was published in the local newspapers on 4th July 2019. 
In the auction sale, the highest bid of Rs.81,20,000/- offered 
by the appellant was accepted. A sale confirmation certificate 
was issued on 5th September 2019 by the 3rd respondent to the 
appellant. The amount of Rs.81,20,000/- was deposited by the 
appellant on 21st July 2019 with the 3rd respondent. The excess 
amount of Rs.59,64,600/- was sought to be refunded to the 
borrowers by the 3rd respondent by a cheque along with a letter 
dated 5th September 2019. It appears that the cheque was 
returned due to inter se dispute amongst the borrowers. 
4. 
The 1st and 2nd respondents invoked the writ jurisdiction 
of the High Court of Karnataka for setting aside the auction. By 
judgment dated 17th March 2022, the learned Single 
Judge proceeded to set aside the auction sale made in favour of 
the appellant. The learned Single Judge held that the 4th 
respondent bank was entitled to the awarded amount along 
with interest, and the 1st and 2nd respondents are liable to pay 
the said amount to the bank. The learned Single Judge noted 
that the amount of Rs.25,61,400/- was deposited by the 1st and 

2nd respondents within three months of filing the writ petition. 
The learned Single Judge allowed the 4th respondent bank to 
withdraw the said amount together with interest accrued 
thereon. The learned Single Judge directed the 4th respondent 
to refund the entire auction amount paid by the appellant along 
with an additional amount of 5 per cent of the said amount in 
the light of sub-rule 4(b) of Rule 38 of the Karnataka Co-
operative Societies Rules, 1960 (for short, ‘the Rules’). 
5. 
Being aggrieved by the judgment of the learned Single 
Judge, the appellant preferred Writ Appeal before the Division 
Bench, which was dismissed by the judgment dated 5th 
September 2022. 
6. 
The decisions of the learned Single Judge and the Division 
Bench are the subject matter of challenge in this appeal. 
7. 
Though the direction to set aside the auction sale was 
challenged in this appeal, as can be seen from the order dated 
17th March 2023 passed by this Court, notice was issued only 
on the issue of adequately compensating the appellant. The 
said order records that the 4th respondent bank retained the 
sum of Rs.81,20,000/- paid by the appellant from 21st July 
2019. Order dated 4th January 2024 records the statement of 
the learned counsel appearing for the 4th respondent that the 
amount deposited by the appellant was received by the said 
respondent on 13th October 2022. Till that date, it was lying 
with the 3rd respondent. The order dated 12th January 2024 

passed by this Court records that the appellant was claiming 
interest from the 3rd and 4th respondents. 
SUBMISSIONS 
8. 
We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the 
appellant and the learned counsel for the 4th respondent. Notice 
has been duly served to the 3rd respondent. 
9. 
The submission of the learned counsel appearing for the 
appellant is that solatium at 5 per cent of the amount deposited 
by the appellant granted to the appellant is inadequate. He 
submitted that the appellant was deprived of the use of the sum 
of Rs.81,20,000/- from 21st July 2019. Therefore, the appellant 
was deprived of interest on the said amount. He would, thus, 
submit that the appellant is entitled to receive interest on the 
said amount from the date of its deposit till the date of refund. 
10. 
The learned counsel appearing for the 4th respondent 
submitted that as per the said Rules, while setting aside the 
auction, 5 per cent of the amount deposited by the appellant 
has been ordered to be paid to the appellant by way of 
compensation. The learned counsel submitted that in view of 
the payment of the 5 per cent amount, the appellant had been 
adequately compensated. He submitted that, in any case, the 
4th respondent bank received the amount deposited by the 
appellant on 13th October 2022, and therefore, liability, if any, 
to pay interest cannot be fastened on the 4th respondent for the 
period prior to 13th October 2022. 

CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS 
11. 
We have perused the impugned judgments. The learned 
Single Judge, in paragraph 7 of the impugned judgment, has 
noted that within a period of three months from the date of filing 
of the Writ Petition, the 1st and 2nd respondents deposited the 
due amount of Rs.25,61,400/- in the Court. The learned Single 
Judge observed that the award against the 1st and 2nd 
respondents was in the sum of Rs.21,92,942/- along with 
interest at the rate of 15 per cent and costs. Accordingly, the 1st 
and 2nd respondents had deposited a sum of Rs.25,61,400/- in 
terms of the award. Therefore, the learned Single Judge 
concluded that the 1st and 2nd respondents were not wilful 
defaulters. The learned Single Judge placed reliance on sub-
rules 4(a) and 4(b) of Rule 38 of the said Rules. Clause (b) of 
sub-rule 4 of Rule 38 provides that when an owner of a property 
sold in auction makes an application within 30 days from the 
date of sale and deposits the arrears specified in the sale 
proclamation within the said period of 30 days, the Recovery 
Officer shall pass an order setting aside the sale. While doing 
so, the Recovery Officer shall refund the purchase money to the 
auction purchaser together with 5 per cent of the amount 
deposited by the person applying for setting aside the auction. 
As the 1st and 2nd respondents did not apply for setting aside 
the auction within 30 days, clause (b) of sub-rule 4 of Rule 38 
had no application. However, the learned Single Judge, while 
exercising discretionary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the 
Constitution of India, directed that the appellant 
be 

compensated by paying 5 per cent of the amount deposited by 
him as the auction purchaser. In law, there was no basis for 
the said direction. The Division Bench has confirmed the said 
direction by holding that payment of the additional amount of 
5 per cent adequately compensates the appellant. The 4th 
respondent bank has not challenged the impugned orders and 
has thus accepted the finding that the appellant must be 
compensated. 
12. 
In short, the High Court set aside the auction sale not 
based on the provisions of the said Rules or on the ground that 
the auction was illegal. The High Court set aside the auction on 
equitable considerations, as the entire amount due and payable 
to the 4th respondent bank, including interest, was deposited 
by the 1st and 2nd respondents with the High Court within three 
months from filing the Writ Petition. 
13. 
Therefore, there is no doubt that the appellant must be 
compensated as he was deprived of using the amount of 
Rs.81,20,000/- from 21st July 2019 till the date of 
actual refund due to no fault on his part. As stated earlier, the 
amount was transferred by the 3rd respondent to the 4th 
respondent on 13th October 2022. 
14. 
In our view, the appellant was entitled to receive interest 
on the said amount of Rs.81,20,000/- at the rate of 6 per cent 
per annum from the date of deposit of the said amount till the 
date of refund. It is an admitted position that the 3rd 
respondent conducted the auction of the property claimed by 

the 1st and 2nd respondents at the instance of the 4th 
respondent. Admittedly, the 4th respondent bank has not 
challenged the impugned orders and has thus accepted the 
finding that the appellant must be compensated. Therefore, the 
4th respondent bank will be liable to pay interest to the 
appellant. The fact that the amount was lying deposited with 
the 3rd respondent is irrelevant as the auction was at the 
instance of the 4th respondent. Though there was nothing 
illegal about the auction, 4th respondent did not challenge the 
impugned orders. Therefore, the impugned judgments need 
modification in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the 
case for adequately compensating the appellant. 
 
15. 
Accordingly, we pass the following order: 
a) The impugned judgments dated 5th September 2022 and 
17th March 2022 are hereby modified by setting aside 
direction to pay an amount equivalent to 5 per cent of 
Rs.81,20,000/- to the appellant; 
b) We direct the 4th respondent to pay simple interest at the 
rate of 6 per cent per annum on the sum of Rs. 
81,20,000/- to the appellant from 21st July 2019 till the 
date of the actual refund of the amount of Rs. 
81,20,000/- to the appellant; and 
c) The entire interest amount shall be paid by the 4th 
respondent to the appellant within a period of six weeks 
from today. d) The appeal is, accordingly, partly allowed on above 
terms.
