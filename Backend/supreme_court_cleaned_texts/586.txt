JUDGMENT 
 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 
 
1. Leave granted. 
2. These appeals assail the common impugned 
order dated 28.12.2017 passed by the Division 
Bench of the High Court of Gujarat in LPA No. 
765/2017 in Special along with other allied appeals. The 
LPA was preferred by the respondent State of 
Gujarat against the order of Single Judge dated 
19.04.2017 directing the State of Gujarat to 
remove the anomaly in the pay of the appellants 
Petitioners qua their juniors by stepping up their 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. pay. The Division Bench allowed the LPA by the 
State and set aside the Single Judge’s order. 
FACTUAL MATRIX – 
3. The matters pertain to the issue whether or not 
the principle of stepping up of pay of an employee 
on the basis of the pay of his junior, is applicable 
in the present case, where the appellants are put 
on a lesser pay scale than the Assistant 
Professors who were appointed before them as ad 
hoc lecturers and subsequently regularized. The 
genesis of controversy goes back to the period of 
1984-95 when 111 persons came to be engaged 
as Lecturers on ad hoc basis in various 
Government Colleges. The University Grants 
Commission1 has framed the Regulations of 
1998, inter alia, providing for minimum length of 
service of four years for lecturers (Assistant 
Professor) with PhD and M. Phil and of six years 
for others to be eligible to move to Senior Scale 
(i.e., 10000-325-15200) and on completion of 
another five years of service, for being eligible to 
move to Selection Grade (i.e., 12000-420-18300). 
 
1 UGC, hereinafter 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. 

The said regulations also provided for counting of 
services during ad hoc period for grant of Senior 
Scale and Selection Grade Pay. 
4. In view of the above regulations, the Education 
Department, issued a Government Resolution 
dated 17.06.1999 for considering previous 
services rendered by the ad hoc lecturers for the 
purpose 
of 
their 
placement 
in 
Senior 
Scale/Selection Grade. Subsequent to the said 
Resolution, the Government provided benefits to 
some of the ad hoc lecturers subject to conditions 
as provided therein. In 2001, some other ad hoc 
lecturers [1984-95 Group] approached the High 
Court for regularization of their services. 
However, the said Special Civil Application was 
dismissed against which LPA No. 485 of 2002 
was preferred. 
5. In the year 2001 itself, the appellants in the 
instant case came to be directly selected and 
appointed as Assistant Professors by the Gujarat 
Public Service Commission2. 
 
2 GPSC, hereinafter 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. 

6. On 15.11.2002, the State Government framed 
the Gujarat Civil Services (Pay) Rules, 20023 
wherein Rule 21 provides for stepping up of a pay 
of Government Employee on the basis of the pay 
of his junior, while categorically stipulating that 
the provision of the said Rule will apply where the 
pay of a junior is fixed higher than his senior on 
his promotion to the higher cadre. 
7. Alongside, in LPA No. 485 of 2002 preferred by 
the ad hoc lecturers for regularization, the 
Division Bench of the High Court in its order 
dated 11.12.2002 held that the services of the ad 
hoc lecturers cannot be regularized contrary to 
the Recruitment Rules in the post for which 
direct recruits were already selected through 
GPSC, but in the facts and circumstances of the 
case, directed the ad hoc lecturers to be treated 
as a separate class in view of their ad hoc 
continuance for nearly a decade and be 
considered for absorption in such posts as may 
be available with the government. Accordingly, 
rest of the ad hoc Assistant Professors came to be 
 
3 2002 Pay Rules, hereinafter 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. selected through GPSC and appointed as regular 
Assistant Professors in addition to the ad hoc 
lecturers who were already appointed as regular 
Assistant Professors in 2001. 
8. Further, the ad hoc lecturers who were appointed 
as 
regular 
Assistant 
Professors 
in 

approached the High Court by way of Special 
 and other 
connected matters seeking the relief of counting 
ad hoc services for the purpose of senior 
scale/selection grade. The High Court disposed 
of the said matters by directing the State 
Authorities to decide their representation. The 
State 
Government, 
vide 
its 
letter 
dated 
29.03.2008, rejected their claim for counting ad 
hoc services for the purpose of grant of senior 
scale/selection grade on the ground that their 
initial appointment was without the requisite 
permission of GPSC. 
9. In 2009, the Assistant Professors who got 
selected 
through 
direct 
appointment 
were 
extended the benefit of senior scale/selection 
grade effective from their date of selection 
through GPSC. 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. 

10. On 30.06.2010, UGC framed Regulations of 2010 
treating Career Advancement Scheme as an 
avenue for promotion. It may be noted here that 
ad hoc services were eligible to be counted for 
different recruitments/promotion under Career 
Advancement Scheme. 
11. The Government vide its resolution dated 
03.08.2011 allowed the ad hoc services of 111 
Professors [1984-95 Group] to be counted for the 
purpose 
of 
pay, 
leave 
and 
pension. 
Subsequently, a letter dated 27.09.2011 was 
written by the Joint Secretary, Education 
Department 
to 
the 
Commissioner, 
Higher 
Education, 
clarifying 
that 
the 
benefit 
of 
Resolution dated 03.08.2011 would not be 
extended for the purpose of seniority. 
12. Consequently, the State Government, while 
referring to its earlier Government Resolution 
dated 
17.06.1999 
and 
the 
Government 
Resolution 
dated 
02.08.2011, 
issued 
the 
Government Resolution dated 22.12.2014 for 
counting the previous services rendered by the 
erstwhile ad hoc lecturers for extending the 
benefits of Senior Scale/Selection Grade to the 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. eligible Assistant Professors out of the total 
erstwhile ad hoc lecturers [1984-95 Group]. 
13. Accordingly, the State Government issued an 
Order dated 10.08.2015 granting the benefit of 
Senior Scale and Selection Grade to 85 eligible 
Assistant 
Professors 
by 
considering 
their 
previous ad hoc services. It so happened that by 
counting such ad hoc services rendered by such 
lecturers [1984-95 Group], all of them were 
getting higher pay than the direct appointees 
selected 
by 
GPSC. 
Aggrieved 
by 
this, 
a 
representation dated 19.10.2015 was submitted 
to the Government by the direct appointees to 
step up their pay in accordance with Rule 21 of 
the 2002 Pay Rules. It also gave rise to filing of 
petitions before the Single Judge of the High 
Court for appropriate writ, direction and order to 
remove the anomaly in their pay resulting from 
the office order dated 10.08.2015 and grant 
stepping up their pay on the basis of Rule 21. It 
is also to be noted here that the State 
Government, vide Resolution dated 06.03.2017, 
clarified that the Career Advancement Scheme is 
not related to promotion and deleted the terms 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. 

“promotion” occurring in resolutions dated 
18.04.2016 and 03.08.2016. 
14. The Single Judge of the High Court, vide 
judgment dated 19.04.2017, held that Rule 21 is 
applicable in the present case based on the 
finding that the grant of Senior Scale and 
Selection Grade under the Career Advancement 
Scheme can be said to be promotion and 
therefore, when at the time of grant of Senior 
Scale and Selection Grade under the Career 
Advancement Scheme, there is anomaly in the 
pay scale between the Senior and Junior. It, 
accordingly, granted the benefit of stepping up, 
holding that the seniors (original Petitioners) are 
entitled to pay at par with their junior who were 
selected and appointed subsequent to them. 
15. The Single Judge also specifically observed that 
the original petitioners have not challenged the 
Government Resolutions dated 03.08.2011 and 
22.12.2014 
and 
the 
office 
order 
dated 
10.08.2015, or the action of the Respondents in 
granting the Senior Scale and Selection Grade to 
the said junior lectures by counting their past 
seniority rendered as ad hoc. Therefore, the 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. 

Court chose to refrain itself from expressing any 
opinion on the validity of the said Government 
Resolutions. The Single Judge also noted that the 
subsequent appointees appear to have been 
treated as a separate class by the State for the 
purpose of considering their past ad hoc services 
as permissible under the UGC Regulations and 
such classification is not discriminatory, thus 
the ground of equal pay for equal work taken by 
the Petitioners therein would not stand. However, 
by granting the benefit of Rule 21, the State was 
directed to step up the pay of the original 
Petitioners. 
16. Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the Single 
Judge, original Respondents-State and others 
preferred Letters Patent Appeals before the 
Division Bench of the High Court. 
17. It was held by the Division Bench of the High 
Court 
that 
in 
the 
peculiar 
facts 
and 
circumstances of the case, Rule 21 of the 2002 
Pay Rules shall not be applicable at all since it 
applies only where the anomaly so caused must 
be the direct result of the application of Rule 21. 
The Court proceeded on the footing that grant of 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. 

Senior Scale and Selection Grade under the 
Career Advancement Scheme can be said to be 
promotion. It was observed that if the case on 
behalf of the original petitioners is accepted and 
their pay is fixed at par with all those 85 
Assistant Professors who as such rendered their 
services as ad hoc lecturers, in that case, all the 
original 
petitioners, 
who 
admittedly 
never 
rendered their services as ad hoc lecturers like all 
those 85 lecturers and who for the first time 
joined their services in 2001, will be granted the 
benefit of the earlier years during which they 
never rendered their services as ad hoc or 
otherwise and/or when they were not even born 
in the cadre. 
18. The Division Bench also noted that though it is 
the specific case on behalf of the original 
Petitioners that counting the earlier services of 
85 Assistant Professors as ad hoc is absolutely 
illegal, still the very Petitioners are asking the 
same pay which all those 85 Assistant Professors 
are getting by counting their earlier ad hoc 
services, meaning thereby, it can be said that the 
original Petitioners pray that they may also be 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. granted the benefit of such illegality. There 
cannot be negative discrimination. Accordingly, 
it was held that the Single Judge had materially 
erred in granting the benefit of stepping up under 
Rule 21. The Division Bench allowed the appeals 
preferred by the State and set aside the order 
passed by the Single Judge. 
19. Aggrieved by the said order, the original writ 
Petitioners are in appeals before us. We have 
heard Mr.Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel 
appearing for the appellants and Mr.Kanu 
Agarwal 
and 
Ms.Swati 
Ghildiyal, 
learned 
counsels appearing for the respondents. 
ARGUMENTS ADVANCED – 
20. Appellants have submitted that it is an 
undeniable fact that the subsequent appointees 
are junior to the Petitioners. The appellants who 
are seniors are seeking pay parity with the junior 
members of the cadre. That the instant case 
fulfils the requisite conditions for invoking Rule 
21 of the 2002 Pay Rules as the said rule does 
not contemplate such anomalous situation 
where the junior is paid more salary than the 
senior. It was argued that the provisions of Rule 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. 

21 are applicable in the fact-situation of the 
present case in view of: - 
a. Junior and senior government employees 
belong to one and same cadre; 
b. 
Time-scale of pay of the lower post held by 
the junior and senior is identical; and, 
c. 
Time-scale of the higher-post to which the 
government employee is promoted, is identical. 
21. It is also submitted by the appellants that the 
State Government has resolved that Career 
Advancement Scheme is in the nature of 
promotion as indicated in the UGC guideline. 
Thus, Rule 21 is applicable and if the junior to 
the appellants have been granted the benefit of 
Career Advancement Scheme, the appellants 
who are senior to them, are entitled to the salary 
that they draw when the appellants are granted 
the benefit of Career Advancement Scheme. 
22. Further, at one point, it is also argued by some 
of the appellants that the change from ad hoc to 
regular employees should be treated as break in 
service and service rendered as ad hoc ought not 
to be considered at the time of calculating total 
length of service. The Respondents, by passing 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. the aforementioned resolutions, have led to the 
present anomaly. 
23. Appellants also argued that if juniors get higher 
pay than the seniors, and the seniors have no 
promotional avenue, their seniority becomes 
insignificant. In that case, the very purpose of 
making regular appointment through GPSC after 
following the due recruitment process would be 
frustrated and this could have demoralizing 
effect on the working of seniors. It is to avoid 
such situation that their pay deserves to be 
stepped up to the pay equal to their juniors. 
24. Lastly, 
appellants 
relied on 
the 
following 
judgments to supplement weight to their 
arguments: 
i) 
Union of India & Ors. v. C.R. Madhava 
Murthy & Anr.4, 
ii) 
Ashok Ram Parhad & Ors. v. State of 
Maharashtra & Ors.5, 
iii) 
Gurcharan Singh Grewal v. Punjab SEB6 
 
4 (2002) 
5 (2023) SCC Online SC 265 
6 (2009) 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. 

25. On the other hand, Respondents submitted that 
they are not disputing the fact that the 
appellants are senior to the ad hoc appointees 
[1984-95 Group] and the same position has also 
been accepted by the Single Bench as well as 
Division Bench of the High Court. It is submitted 
that despite the ad hoc appointees being juniors, 
Rule 21 is not applicable in the present case 
since the conditions stated in the said rule have 
not been fulfilled in the present case as the 
anomaly in pay is not a direct result of the 
application of the rule. That Clause (v) of Sub-
rule (1) of Rule 21 clearly contemplates that if 
even in the lower post the junior Government 
employee draws from time to time the higher rate 
of pay than the senior by virtue of fixation of the 
pay under the normal rule or by grant of advance 
increments for any reasons, the same shall not 
be applicable to step up the pay of the senior 
Government employees. 
26. Further, it was submitted that if the argument of 
the appellants that Rule 21 is applicable and 
consequently, their pay should be stepped up, is 
to be accepted, it would amount to giving benefit 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. to the Petitioners and others of the earlier years, 
during which admittedly they were not even born 
in the cadre and not even serving, unlike the 
1984-95 Group. 
27. The Respondents relied upon the following 
judgments to stress that in similar facts and 
circumstances, this Court has held that rule of 
stepping up shall not be applicable: 
i) 
Union of India v. R. Swaminathan7, 
ii) 
Union of India v. M. Suryanarayana Rao8, 
iii) 
Union of India v. Sushil Kumar Paul9, 
iv) 
ESI 
Corporation 
v. 
P.K. 
Srinivasmurthy10, 
ISSUE AT HAND – 
28. It is not in dispute that the appellants have not 
challenged the Resolutions dated 22.12.2014 
and 10.08.2015, nor have they made 85 
Assistant Professors [1984-95 Group] as party to 
the present proceedings. Therefore, it is clear 
that it is not the case of the appellants that the 
said 85 Assistant Professors have been wrongly 
 
7 (1997) 
8 (1998) 
9 (1998) 
10 (1997) 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. granted the benefit, through the said resolutions. 
It is also not the case of the appellants that the 
said 85 Assistant Professors were not eligible for 
getting the said benefits. 
29. Further, it is also an admitted fact that the 
appellants are seniors to the 1984-95 Group and 
is not under dispute. Moreover, even though the 
Government, vide resolution dated 06.03.2017, 
has clarified that the Career Advancement 
Scheme is not related to promotion and therefore 
deleted the terms “promotions” occurring in 
resolutions dated 18.04.2016 and 03.08.2016, 
the High Court had proceeded on the footing that 
the grant of Senior Scale and Selection Grade 
under the Career Advancement Scheme can be 
said to be promotion to elucidate that such an 
argument would not help the case of the 
Petitioners. So, considering that the said 
resolutions of the Government are not under 
challenge in the instant case, we will also deal 
with the relevant issue at hand presuming that 
even if the Career Advancement Scheme is 
considered to be promotion. 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. 

30. The short question that requires determination 
in the present case boils down to whether Rule 
21 of the 2002 Pay Rules would be applicable in 
the facts and circumstances of the present case 
or not. Rule 21 is quoted as under: 
“21. Stepping up of a pay of a Government 
employee on the basis of the pay of his 
junior: 
(1) Where on regulating initial pay of a 
Government employee under above rules-11, 
13, 15 to 17 & 19 or on his appointment to a 
higher post if his pay is fixed at a lower rate 
of 
pay 
in 
that 
cadre 
than 
another 
Government employee junior to him in the 
lower grade but promoted or appointed 
subsequently in such another identical 
cadre; the pay of the senior Government 
employee on the higher post shall be stepped 
up to the figure equal to the pay as fixed for 
the junior Government employee in that 
higher post with effect from the date of 
promotion 
of 
the 
junior 
Government 
employee and it shall be subject to the 
following conditions viz:- 
i. both, 
the 
junior 
and 
the 
senior 
Government employees belong to one and the 
same cadre and the posts to which they have 
been promoted or appointed, shall be 
identical and in the same cadre and in the 
same line of promotion; 
ii. the time-scales of pay of the lower posts 
held 
by 
the 
senior 
and 
the 
junior 
Government employees shall be identical; 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. iii. the time scales of the higher posts to 
which 
the 
Government 
employees 
are 
promoted or appointed shall be identical; 
iv. the senior Government employee had he 
not been appointed to the higher post earlier 
than his junior, he would have been eligible 
to draw pay at a stage not lower than that 
admissible to his junior in the lower post 
immediately prior to the appointment of the 
junior Government employee to the higher 
post; 
iv. the anomaly so caused must be the direct 
result of the application of this rule. For 
example, if even in the lower post the junior 
Government employee draws from time to 
time a higher rate of pay than the senior by 
virtue of fixation of pay under the normal 
rules or by grant of advance increment(s) for 
any reason, these provisions shall not be 
applicable to step up the pay of the senior 
Government employee. v. the pay of the senior Government employee 
so increased due to stepping up of pay shall 
not be reduced on reversion of the junior 
Government employee nor shall it be 
increased again with reference to the pay of 
the same officer. 
(2) After the re-fixation of pay of the senior 
Government employee with reference to the 
pay of his junior, the next increment shall 
occur to him only after he has rendered the 
qualifying service which is necessary for 
drawing such increment from the stage at 
which his pay had been refixed.” 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. 

ANALYSIS – 
31. A bare reading of the above provision makes it 
clear that a strict compliance of the said rule is 
necessary. The Rule of stepping up shall apply 
only if the conditions specified therein are 
fulfilled. Specifically, condition no. (v) of Rule 21 
stipulates that the anomaly must be the direct 
result of the application of this rule. It further 
states by way of an example that, if even in the 
lower post the junior Government employee 
draws from time to time the higher rate of pay 
than the senior by way of fixation of the pay 
under the normal rule or by grant of advance 
increments for any reasons, the same shall not 
be applicable to step up the pay of the senior 
Government employee. 
32. It is to be noted that in the present case, the 
anomaly in pay is not a direct result of Rule 21. 
Rather, the alleged anomaly arose because the 
85 Assistant Professors [1984-95 Group] have 
been 
granted 
the 
benefit 
of 
Senior 
Scale/Selection Grade Pay by taking into 
account the ad hoc services that they have 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. rendered in the past. Therefore, Rule 21 becomes 
inapplicable in the present case. 
33. Moreover, if the present appeals are allowed, 
then it would amount to giving benefit to the 
appellants and others of the earlier years, during 
which admittedly they were not even born in the 
cadre and not even serving. This would go 
against the principle of equity. Such a benefit 
cannot be claimed by the Petitioners for the years 
of service that they have not actually rendered. 
34. The case laws cited by the Appellants are not 
applicable to the instant case as they are 
distinguishable on facts. More specifically, 
Madhava Murthy (supra), it was a case where a 
junior was drawing more pay on account of 
upgradation under the ACP Scheme and there 
was an anomaly and therefore, the pay of senior 
was required to be stepped up. However, the said 
junior had not rendered any ad hoc services, 
which is not quite the case at hand. Similarly, 
Gurcharan Singh Grewal (supra) was also not a 
case involving ad hoc services. It was a matter 
wherein the Appellant was merely seeking to step 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. up his pay as was done for another appellant 
situated similarly. Lastly, in Ashok Ram Parhad 
(supra), the grant of monetary benefit was not 
under contention. Rather, that matter was with 
regards to the inter se seniority which is not a 
point of dispute in the instant case. Hence, none 
of the case laws relied on by the Appellants help 
their case. 
35. It is also befitting here to briefly refer to the 
relevant judgments by this Court rendered 
earlier on the subject-matter, which have been 
relied by the Respondents: 
36. The case of R. Swaminathan (supra) is a matter 
with very similar factual matrix wherein certain 
employees claiming seniority were claiming step 
up if their juniors are getting more pay on 
account of their ad hoc services being counted. 
Certain junior employees had officiated on a 
promotional post on an ad hoc basis due to 
administrative exigencies., due to which their 
pay on their regular promotion was fixed higher 
than their senior. The Court held as under: 
“10. According to the aggrieved employees, 
this has resulted in an anomaly, Government 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. 

Order bearing No. F.2(78)-E.III(A)/66 dated 
4-2-1966 has been issued for removal of 
anomaly by stepping up of pay of a senior on 
promotion drawing less pay than his junior. 
It provides as follows: 
“10. Removal of anomaly by stepping up of 
pay of senior on promotion drawing less pay 
than his junior.—(a) As a result of application 
of FR 22-C.—In order to remove the anomaly 
of a government servant promoted or 
appointed to a higher post on or after 1-4-
1961 drawing a lower rate of pay in that post 
than another government servant junior to 
him in the lower grade and promoted or 
appointed subsequently to another identical 
post, it has been decided that in such cases 
the pay of the senior officer in the higher post 
should be stepped up to a figure equal to the 
pay as fixed for the junior officer in that 
higher post. The stepping up should be done 
with effect from the date of promotion or 
appointment of the junior officer and will be 
subject to the following conditions, namely: 
(a) Both the junior and senior officers should 
belong to the same cadre and the posts in 
which they have been promoted or appointed 
should be identical and in the same cadre; 
(b) the scale of pay of the lower and higher 
posts in which they are entitled to draw pay 
should be identical; 
(c) the anomaly should be directly as a result 
of the application of FR 22-C. For example, if 
even in the lower post the junior officer draws 
from time to time a higher rate of pay than 
the senior by virtue of grant of advance 
increments, the above provisions will not be 
invoked to step up the pay of the senior 
officer. 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. 

The orders refixing the pay of the senior 
officers in accordance with the above 
provisions shall be issued under FR 27. The 
next increment of the senior officer will be 
drawn on completion of the requisite 
qualifying service with effect from the date of 
refixation of pay.” 
As the Order itself states, the stepping up is subject 
to three conditions: (1) Both the junior and the senior 
officers should belong to the same cadre and the 
posts in which they have been promoted should be 
identical and in the same cadre; (2) the scales of pay 
of the lower and higher posts should be identical; 
and (3) anomaly should be directly as a result of the 
application of Fundamental Rule 22-C which is now 
Fundamental Rule 22(I)(a)(1). We are concerned 
with the last condition. The difference in the pay 
of a junior and a senior in the cases before us is 
not as a result of the application of Fundamental 
Rule 22(I)(a)(1). The higher pay received by a 
junior is on account of his earlier officiation in 
the higher post because of local officiating 
promotions which he got in the past. Because of 
the proviso to Rule 22 he may have earned 
increments in the higher pay scale of the post to 
which he is promoted on account of his past 
service and also his previous pay in the 
promotional post has been taken into account in 
fixing his pay on promotion. It is these two 
factors which have increased the pay of the 
juniors. This cannot be considered as an anomaly 
requiring the stepping up of the pay of the 
seniors. 
11. The Office Memorandum dated 4-11-1993, 
Government of India, Department of Personnel 
and Training, has set out various instances where 
stepping up of pay cannot be done. It gives, inter 
alia, the following instances which have come to 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. the notice of the Department with a request for 
stepping up of pay. These are: 
“(a) 
Where 
a 
senior 
proceeds 
on 
Extraordinary 
Leave 
which 
results 
in 
postponement of date of next increment in 
the lower post, consequently he starts 
drawing less pay than his junior in the lower 
grade itself. He, therefore, cannot claim pay 
parity on promotion even though he may 
have been promoted earlier to the higher 
grade: 
(b) If a senior foregoes/refuses promotion 
leading 
to 
his 
junior 
being 
promoted/appointed to the higher post 
earlier, the junior draws higher pay than the 
senior. The senior may be on deputation 
while the junior avails of the ad hoc 
promotion in the cadre. The increased pay 
drawn by a junior either due to ad hoc 
officiating/regular service rendered in the 
higher posts for periods earlier than the 
senior, cannot, therefore, be an anomaly in 
strict sense of the term. 
(c) If a senior joins the higher post later than 
the junior for whatsoever reasons, whereby 
he draws less pay than the junior, in such 
cases the senior cannot claim stepping up of 
pay on a par with the junior. 
(d) ***” 
There are also other instances cited in the 
Memorandum. The Memorandum makes it 
clear that in such instances a junior drawing 
more pay than his senior will not constitute 
an anomaly and, therefore, stepping up of 
pay will not be admissible. The increased 
pay drawn by a junior because of ad hoc 
officiating or regular service rendered by 
him in the higher post for periods earlier 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. than the senior is not an anomaly because 
pay does not depend on seniority alone 
nor is seniority alone a criterion for 
stepping up of pay. 
13. The 
employees 
in 
question 
are, 
therefore, not entitled to have their pay 
stepped up under the said Government 
Order because the difference in the pay 
drawn by them and the higher pay drawn 
by their juniors is not as a result of any 
anomaly; nor is it a result of the 
application 
of 
Fundamental 
Rule 
22(I)(a)(1).” 
 
37. Similarly, in the case of Suryanarayana Rao 
(supra), the Respondent was promoted and he 
was senior to two other persons, yet his pay was 
fixed at a lesser scale whereas the pay of the said 
two persons was fixed on a higher scale for the 
reason that the said juniors were promoted 
earlier to the promotional posts on an ad hoc 
basis. The Court had relied on the ratio laid down 
in R. Swaminathan (supra) and refused to 
grant the relief of stepping up. 
 
CONCLUSION – 
38. In light of the facts and circumstances of the 
case(s), 
the 
discussion 
laid 
out 
above 
surrounding Rule 21 and a perusal of the 

SLP(C) No. 9098 of 2018 etc.etc. authorities elucidated above, we do not find any 
merit in the contentions of the appellants. 
39. We, thus, hold that Rule 21 of the 2002 Pay Rules 
is inapplicable in the instant case(s) and no relief 
can be granted to the appellants. The present 
appeals deserve to be dismissed. It is ordered 
accordingly. 
40. Pending applications (if any) are disposed of.
