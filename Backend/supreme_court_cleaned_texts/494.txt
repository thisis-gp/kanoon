JUDGMENT 
 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 
 
1. Delay, if any, is condoned. 
2. Leave granted. 
3. This appeal assails the correctness of the judgment 
and order dated 24.11.2016 passed by the High 
Court of Judicature at Madras whereby, it dismissed 
the civil revision registered as CRP(PD) No.1872 of 
2016 and also an application under Order VII Rule 
11 CPC registered as Application No.3666 of 2016 in 

SLP ( 

Commercial Suit No.323 of 2016. Aggrieved by the 
same, the defendant in both the proceedings is 
before this Court. 
4. Brief facts giving rise to the present appeal is as 
follows: 
 
A Leave and License agreement was originally 
entered into between the appellant and the 
respondent on 25.11.2008. This agreement was 
superseded 
by 
another 
agreement 
dated 
01/12/2010 whereby the appellant became a 
licensee in respect of a warehouse on a monthly 
license fee of Rs.30 lakhs with an escalation clause. 
As there was default in payment of storage charges, 
the respondent gave a legal notice dated 27.11.2014 
terminating the license, claiming dues towards 
storage charges, damages and directing the 
appellant to vacate the warehouse premises within 
two months. The appellant replied to the said notice 
on 18.12.2014 denying the dues and also raising 
some objections regarding extent of the building 

SLP ( 

mentioned in the notice. The respondent instituted 
a suit for permanent injunction and also to hand 
over vacant possession in the Court of District 
Munsif, Sriperumbudur registered as O.S. No.101 
of 2015. The respondent in the plaint of the above 
suit had clearly mentioned that there were 
outstanding dues and arrears of storage charges of 
Rs.2,04,68,464/-. 
It 
was 
further 
specifically 
mentioned that respondent-plaintiff reserves its 
rights to claim against the defendant-appellant for 
recovery of arrears and also damages due to the 
illegal use and occupation of the Schedule-B 
property. 
5. After about seven months, the appellant filed a 
commercial suit before the Madras High Court 
registered as C.S. No.914 of 2015 against the 
respondent and also Small Industries Promotion 
Corporation of Tamil Nadu for the relief of 
declaration that the respondent had given only 
1,03,522 sq. ft. area of the factory shed and not 

SLP ( 

1,50,000 sq. ft. under the Leave and License 
agreement dated 25.11.2008. 
6. On 24.11.2015, the respondent filed an application 
under Order II Rule 2(3) read with Section 151 CPC 
in its pending O.S. No.101 of 2015 seeking leave to 
sue the appellant by way of a separate suit claiming 
arrears of storage charges, warehouse charges and 
damages for illegal use and occupation beyond the 
period allowed in the notice dated 27.11.2014. The 
said application registered as IA No.2001 of 2015, 
was allowed by the District Munsif Court on the 
same day. However, the High Court, upon revision 
by the appellant, set aside the said order and 
remanded the matter back to the Trial Court for a 
fresh decision after affording due opportunity of 
hearing to the defendant to the suit i.e. the appellant. 
This order was passed by the High Court on 
28.01.2016. After remand, the District Munsif Court, 
by a detailed reasoned order dated 15.04.2016, 
again granted leave under Order II Rule 2(3) CPC to 

SLP ( 

the respondent to file a separate suit against the 
appellant. Aggrieved, the appellant challenged the 
same before the High Court under Article 227 of the 
Constitution, which was registered as CRP (PD) 
No.1872 of 2016. 
7. In the meantime, the respondent filed a Commercial 
Suit No.323 of 2016 before the Madras High Court 
against the appellant for recovery of arrears of 
storage charges, warehouse charges and damages 
for an amount of Rs.8,42,88,761/-. In the said C.S. 
No.323 of 2016, the appellant filed an application 
being IA No.3666 of 2016 under Order VII Rule 11(d) 
read with Order II Rule 2 of CPC for rejection of the 
said claim. This application was filed on 21st July, 
2016. 
8. The civil revision as also the application under Order 
VII Rule 11 CPC were heard together by the High 
Court 
and 
vide 
judgment 
and 
order 
dated 
24.11.2016, the High Court dismissed both the civil 
revision as also the application. Aggrieved by the 

SLP ( 

same, the present appeal has been filed. 
9. In the meantime, the appellant vacated the 
warehouse and handed over the keys to the 
respondent on 30th September, 2016. Accordingly, 
the respondent on 11.04.2017 withdrew its O.S. 
No.101 of 2015 as possession had already been 
delivered to it. 
10. Further, the appellant filed another Commercial Suit 
No.160 of 2017 before the Madras High Court 
claiming refund of security deposit, additional 
deposit, penalty paid to the University Board, cost of 
improvements 
and 
damages 
amounting 
to 
Rs.5,77,03,621/- against the respondent. 
11. From the above, it is noticeable that both the sides 
preferred two suits each, however, one of the suits 
i.e. Suit No.101 of 2015 has already been withdrawn 
by the respondent and, as such, three suits remain 
pending which are all commercial suits pending 
before the Madras High Court inter se parties. 
12. It would be worthwhile to mention here before 

SLP ( 

proceeding any further that the Trial Court as also 
the High Court had found that both the suits were 
filed based upon different causes of action. The High 
Court had further found that the respondent had 
taken leave for instituting the second suit against the 
appellant under Order II Rule 2(3) CPC. It also found 
that the respondent had specifically stated in the 
plaint of the first suit that there were claims for 
damages and warehouse charges to be recovered for 
which, it reserved its claim for recovery of the same. 
At no stage had the respondent given up its claim, 
nor was there any omission to claim the relief of 
recovery. It was neither a case of relinquishment of 
claim or omission. The High Court has dealt with in 
great detail the object of Order II Rule 2(3) CPC. It 
has also discussed the law on the point. It had 
thereafter arrived at the conclusion that neither 
there was infirmity in the order of the Trial Court 
granting leave to file the second suit for recovery of 
arrears, nor was there any merit in the application 

SLP ( 

under Order VII Rule 11 CPC filed by the appellant. 
13. We have heard Sri Shyam Divan, learned Senior 
Counsel for the appellant and Sri Aditya Kumar 
Choudhary, learned counsel appearing for the 
respondent and have also perused the material on 
record. 
14. The submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant 
by the learned Senior Counsel are summarized as 
under: 
(i) The commercial suit bearing C.S. No.323 of 2016 
was clearly barred by Order II Rule 2(2) CPC. 
(ii) The Courts below failed to distinguish between 
relinquishment of claims and omissions of relief. The 
High Court wrongly relied upon the Full Bench 
Judgment of the Bombay High Court in the case of 
Shankar Lal Laxminarayan Rathi and Ors. Vs. 
Gangabisen Manik Lal Silchi and another1 as the 
said judgment had no applicability in the facts of the 
 
 Bom.326 (FB) 

SLP ( 

case. 
15. On the other hand, Shri Choudhary, learned counsel 
for the respondent submitted that the judgment and 
order of the High Court does not suffer from any 
infirmity warranting any interference by this Court. 
Further, strong reliance was placed upon a judgment 
of this Court in the case of Bharat Petrolium 
Corporation 
Ltd. 
And 
another 
Vs. 
ATM 
Constructions Pvt. Ltd 2., wherein under similar 
facts, this Court held that a second suit for arrears 
of rent and damages would not be barred under 
Order II Rule 2 CPC. 
16. Para 18 of the above said judgment is reproduced 
hereunder: 
“18. In view of the enunciation of law, as 
referred to above, suit for possession and suit 
for claiming damages for use and occupation of 
the property are two different causes of action. 
There 
being 
different 
consideration 
for 
adjudication in our opinion, second suit filed by 
the respondent claiming damages for use and 
 
2 2023 SCC Online SC 1614 

SLP ( 

occupation of the premises was maintainable. 
The application filed by the appellants for 
rejection of the plaint was rightly dismissed by 
the Courts below. However, the appellants are 
well within their right to raise the issue, if any 
part of the claim in the suit is time-barred but 
the entire claim cannot be said to be so.” 
 
17. The case in hand stands on a better footing, 
inasmuch 
as, 
the 
plaintiff-respondent 
had 
specifically reserved its rights in the first suit 
regarding claim against warehousing charges, 
damages for illegal use and occupation etc. and 
further had applied for leave before the Trial Court 
for filing a separate suit, which leave had been 
granted. There was neither any relinquishment at 
any stage, nor omission to claim relief. Both the 
causes of action being separate, the second suit was 
clearly maintainable. The appellant, who is facing 
recovery of more than Rs.8 crores, is unnecessarily 
trying to delay the progress in the suit, which is 
pending since 2016. 

SLP ( 

18. In view of the above discussion, we are of the firm 
view that the impugned order does not suffer from 
any infirmity. The judgment in the case of Bharat 
Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (supra) relied upon by 
the respondent squarely applies in the facts of the 
present case and we do not find any reason to take 
a different view. 
19. The appeal lacks merit and is, accordingly, 
dismissed. 
20. Pending applications, if any, are disposed of.
