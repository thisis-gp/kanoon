JUDGMENT
M. M. Sundresh, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment rendered by the Division
Bench of the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir at Jammu in Criminal
Appeal (D) No.11/2020 dated 27.04.2021 by which the judgment
rendered by the Special Judge, National Investigation Agency (NIA) (3rd
Additional Sessions Judge) Jammu, has been confirmed in part, while
remitting the issue pertaining to the charges framed under Sections 306
and 411 of the Jammu and Kashmir State Ranbir Penal Code SVT., 1989
(hereinafter referred to as “RPC, 1989”) along with Section 39 of the
Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (hereinafter referred to as
“UAPA, 1967”) for taking cognizance afresh.

3. Heard Mr. S.V. Raju, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for
the appellant, and Mr. D. Mahesh Babu, learned counsel appearing for the
respondents. We have also perused the written submissions placed on
record by the respondents.
BRIEF FACTS
4. A case was registered against the respondents in Case Crime No. 39/2019
under Sections 307, 120-B, 121, 121-A and 124-A of RPC, 1989, Sections
4 and 5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, and Sections 15, 16, 18
and 20 of the UAPA, 1967 by the jurisdictional police. 
5. The said case was re-registered by the appellant as RC-03/2019/NIA/JMU
on 15.04.2019, subsequent to the order dated 12.04.2019, passed by the
Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Government of India. A complaint
dated 20.09.2019 was conveyed by the District Magistrate, Ramban by
way of a communication to the NIA Court in tune with Sections 196 and
196-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure SVT., 1989 (hereinafter referred
to as “CrPC, 1989”). Pursuant to the said complaint dated 20.09.2019,
investigation was duly completed by the appellant and a chargesheet was
filed on 25.09.2019.
6. Accordingly, the respondents were charge-sheeted for the offences under
Sections 306, 309, 307, 411, 120-B, 121, 121-A and 122 of RPC, 1989,
Sections 16, 18, 20, 23, 38 and 39 of UAPA, 1967, Sections 3 and 4 of
Explosive Substances Act, 1908 and Section 4 of the Jammu & Kashmir

Public Property (Prevention of Damage) Act, 1985, for making an attempt
to ambush and ram the convoy of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)
personnel by a Santro car laden with explosives. Before their attempt
could succeed, a blast occurred resulting in the respondents fleeing from
the place of occurrence. 
7. While taking cognizance, the Special Judge, NIA entertained the
arguments of the respondents. Accordingly, he held that the complaint, as
conveyed by the District Magistrate on 20.09.2019, was not in the
prescribed form, and therefore does not satisfy the mandate as
contemplated under Section 4(1)(e) of CrPC, 1989. 
8. After holding so, the Special Judge, NIA proceeded to conclude that no
cognizance can be taken for the offences charged under Sections 121,
121-A and 122 of the RPC, 1989 as the procedure contemplated under
Section 196-B of CrPC, 1989 has not been followed. Furthermore,
cognizance was also not taken for the offence committed under Section
120-B of RPC, 1989 for the reason that neither was there any
authorization, nor was there any empowerment as required under Section
196-A of CrPC, 1989. Resultantly, cognizance was taken for the
remaining offences. 
9. Aggrieved by the decision of the Special Judge, NIA, both the appellant
and the respondents filed their respective appeals. The Division Bench of
the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir was pleased to hold that the

Special Judge, NIA was wrong on two counts, namely, that the complaint
made was in accordance with Section 4(1)(e) of CrPC, 1989, and in view
of the discretion available under Section 196-B of CrPC, 1989, there is no
question of undertaking any mandatory preliminary investigation.
10.The High Court went on to uphold the finding of the Special Judge, NIA
on the question of authorization or empowerment as required under
Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989, after satisfying itself with the answer given
by the officer concerned, who was physically present before it. 
11.Incidentally, for the remaining offences for which cognizance was taken,
the High Court remitted the case to the Special Judge, NIA for its
satisfaction before deciding to take cognizance for the offences
punishable under Sections 306 and 411 of RPC, 1989 and Section 39 of
UAPA, 1967. Insofar as this issue is concerned, due exercise has already
been undertaken by the Special Judge, NIA and therefore, it is academic
in nature. In fact, the Special Judge, NIA has taken cognizance for the
offences punishable under Sections 121, 121-A and 122 of RPC, 1989,
along with Sections 306 and 411 of RPC, 1989, and under Section 39 of
UAPA, 1967. Thus, we are not inclined to go into those offences for
which the trial is pending at an advanced stage.
12.This leaves us with the only question to be decided in the appeal, which is
on the applicability of Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989 vis-à-vis the

provisions and mandate contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 (hereinafter referred to as “CrPC, 1973”).
13.For the sake of convenience, we have extracted the relevant provisions
contained in CrPC, 1989 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898
(hereinafter referred to as “CrPC, 1898”):
Section 4 of the CrPC, 1989
“4. Definitions. — (1) In this Code the following words and
expressions have the following meanings, unless a different
intention appears from the subject or context: —
xxx
xxx
xxx
(e) “Complaint”. — “complaint” means the allegation made
orally or in writing to a Magistrate, with a view to his taking
action under this Code, that some person, whether known or
unknown, has committed an offence but it does not include the
report of a police-officer”
 (emphasis supplied)
Section 196 of the CrPC, 1989
“196. Prosecution for offences against the State.—No Court shall
take cognizance of any offence punishable under Chapter VI or IX-
A of the Ranbir Penal Code except section 127, and section 171-F,
so far as it relates to the offence of personation, or punishable under
section 108-A, or section 153-A, or section 294-A, or section 295-A
or section 505 of the Ranbir Penal Code, unless upon complaint
made by order of, or under authority from the Government or
District Magistrate or such other officer as may be empowered
by the Government in this behalf.”
 (emphasis supplied)
Section 196-A of the CrPC, 1989
 
“196-A. Prosecution for certain classes of criminal conspiracy. 
No Court shall take cognizance of the offence of criminal
conspiracy punishable under section 120-B of the Ranbir Penal
Code, —

(1) in a case where the object of the conspiracy is to
commit either an illegal act other than an offence, or a
legal act by illegal means, or an offence, to which the
provisions of section 196 apply, unless upon complaint
made by order of, or under authority from the
Government or some officer empowered by the
Government in this behalf, or
 
(2) in a case where the object of the conspiracy is to commit
any non-cognizable offence, or a cognizable offence not
punishable with death, life imprisonment or rigorous
imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards, unless the
Government, or District Magistrate empowered in this behalf
by the Government has, by order in writing, consented to the
initiation of the proceeding
 
Provided that where the criminal conspiracy is one to which
the provisions of sub-section (4) of section 195 apply, no such
consent shall be necessary.”
 (emphasis supplied)
Section 196A of the CrPC, 1898
“Section 196A. Prosecution for certain classes of criminal
conspiracy.—No Court shall take cognizance of the offence of
criminal conspiracy punishable under Section 120B of the Indian
Penal Code,
(1) in a case where the object of the conspiracy is to
commit either an illegal act other than an offence, or a
legal act by illegal means, or an offence to which the
provisions of Section 196 apply, unless upon complaint
made by order or under authority from
 
 the State
Government or some officer empowered by the State
Government in this behalf, or
(2) in a case where the object of the conspiracy is to commit
any non-cognizable offence, or a cognizable offence not
punishable with death, imprisonment for life or rigorous
imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards, unless the
State Government or a Chief Presidency Magistrate or District
Magistrate empowered in this behalf by the State Government
has, by order in writing, consented to the initiation of the
proceedings:
Provided that where the criminal consipracy is one to which
the provisions of sub-section (4) of Section 195 apply no such
consent shall be necessary.”
 (emphasis supplied)

14.Section 4(1)(e) of CrPC, 1989 defines a complaint. Such a complaint
includes an allegation made either orally or in writing. Certainly, there is
no prescribed format for making a complaint, as even an oral allegation
constitutes a complaint. 
15. As per Section 196 of CrPC, 1989 which deals with the offences
committed against the State, a jurisdictional court shall take cognizance
only upon a complaint made by the order of, or under the authority from
the Government, or a District Magistrate, or such other officer as
empowered by the Government for the aforesaid purpose. Thus, Section
196 of CrPC, 1989 forecloses any other methodology than the one
provided thereunder. The compliance is mandatory, failing which a Court
cannot take cognizance under Section 196 of CrPC, 1989.
16.Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989 only deals with specified classes of criminal
conspiracy for the purpose of prosecution. Section 120-B of RPC, 1989
deals with an offence pertaining to conspiracy, which is pari materia to
Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Sub-section (1) of Section
196-A of CrPC, 1989 speaks of the object of the conspiracy qua an illegal
act other than an offence, a legal act by illegal means, or an offence to
which Section 196 of CrPC, 1989 applies. For taking cognizance of such
an offence, a complaint can only be made either by an order of the
Government, or under its authority, or by an officer empowered by it. In

the case of Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989, cognizance of a complaint can
be taken by a Court only after satisfying itself of the due compliance of
sub-section (1) of Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989 with respect to
competence of the authority. 
17.Though Sections 196 and 196-A of CrPC, 1989 seem to be similar insofar
as the authority competent to convey a complaint is concerned, under
Section 196 of CrPC, 1989, a District Magistrate can lodge it by himself,
whereas, the same provision is not available under Section 196-A of
CrPC, 1989. We may also note that Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989 is pari
materia to Section 196A of CrPC, 1898.
THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR REORGANISATION ACT, 2019
18.We place reliance on the following provisions of the Jammu & Kashmir
Reorganisation Act, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act, 2019”)

19.The Act, 2019 came into effect from 31.10.2019, which was the appointed
day as per Notification No. S.O. 2889(E) dated 09.08.2019. Section 95 of
the Act, 2019 speaks of the application of the Central Laws to the Union
Territory of the Jammu & Kashmir and Union Territory of Ladakh. The
aforesaid notification provides a date of application i.e., 31.10.2019, for
the implementation of the Fifth Schedule of the Act, 2019. 
20.A perusal of Table 1 and Table 3 of the Fifth Schedule would clearly show
that CrPC, 1973 would govern the field only from the appointed day and
consequently the CrPC, 1989 stands repealed. To reiterate, it would come
into effect only from the appointed day, and therefore has got no
retrospective application. To make this position clear, the CrPC, 1973
shall be pressed into service from 31.10.2019 onwards, and thus certainly
not before the appointed day. 
THE 2019 ACT VIS-À-VIS THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR
REORGANISATION (REMOVAL OF DIFFICULTIES) ORDER,

21.We place reliance on Section 103 of the Act, 2019 and Para 2(13) of the
Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Removal of Difficulties) Order,
2019 (hereinafter referred to as “the Order, 2019”) which are extracted
below:
Section 103 of the Act, 2019
“103. Power to remove difficulties. — (1) If any difficulty arises
in giving effect to the provisions of this Act, the President may,
by order do anything not inconsistent with such provisions
which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for the
purpose of removing the difficulty:
Provided that no such order shall be made after the expiry of a
period of five years from the appointed day. 
(2) Every order made under this section shall be laid before each
House of Parliament.”
(emphasis supplied)
Para 2(13) of the Order, 2019
“2. Removal of difficulties. —The difficulties arising in giving
effect to the provisions of the principal Act have been removed in
the following manner, namely—
xxx
xxx
xxx
(13) The Acts repealed in the manner provided in Table 3 of the
Fifth Schedule, shall not affect—
( a ) the previous operation of any law so repealed or
anything duly done or suffered there under;
( b ) any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired,
accrued or incurred under any law so repealed;
( c ) any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in
respect of any offence committed against any law so
repealed; or
(d) any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in
respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability,
penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid,
and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy
may be instituted, continued or enforced, and any such
penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if
this Act had not been passed.”
(emphasis supplied)

22.Section 103 of the Act, 2019 confers power upon the President of India to
remove any difficulty that might arise in giving effect to the provisions of
the Act, 2019. It has been conferred, so as to facilitate the application of
new laws, which replaced the then existing ones.
23.In exercise of the powers conferred under Section 103 of the Act, 2019,
the Order, 2019 was promulgated on 30.10.2019, with the appointed day
being 31.10.2019. It was accordingly introduced after completion of the
procedure contemplated under Section 103 of the Act, 2019. 
24. Para 2(13) of the Order, 2019 concerns itself with the circumstances
under which the earlier laws would not be affected. It does not merely
deal with the previous operation of any law, but also any right, obligation
or liability, apart from any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred.
Sub-clause (d) of Clause 13 deals with the position qua an investigation in
respect of any such right or obligation as mentioned in sub-clauses (a) to
(c). However, an addition has been made to the effect that when an
investigation, legal proceeding or remedy, for anything done under the old
law which is inclusive of CrPC, 1989, the same would continue as if the
Act, 2019 had not been passed. It is not only the continuation that has
been facilitated, but also the initiation. 
25. The aforementioned paragraph not only speaks of a mere right, but also
about an obligation. Such an obligation or a right can either be with an
individual, or a State, as the case may be. When the State undertakes the

exercise of investigating an offence, it does so on behalf of the public.
Thus, any investigation in currency at the time of repealing of any statute,
as mentioned in Table 3 of the Fifth Schedule, followed by the
introduction of the Act, 2019, shall continue under CrPC, 1989. However,
the application of law thereon would be the CrPC, 1973. While so, the
CrPC, 1973 cannot be made applicable when the earlier one (i.e. CrPC,
1989) was still in force. 
26.It is to be noted, that a mere non-compliance of an earlier procedure
mentioned in the repealed Code by itself would not enure to the benefit of
an accused, the procedure being a curable one, depending upon the facts
and circumstances of the case. To put it differently, apart from the
question of prejudice, an investigating agency is not debarred from
proceeding further after complying with the omission committed earlier,
by taking recourse to the repealed Code i.e., CrPC, 1989. It is for this
reason, that the Order, 2019 with specific reference to Para 2(13) has been
introduced in exercise of the power conferred under Section 103 of the
Act, 2019.
27.A similar issue was dealt with, way back in the year 1929 by the High
Court of Calcutta in Nibaran Chandra v. Emperor, 1929 A.I.R. 1929
Calcutta 754. Considering the said issue, Justice Mukherjee had rightly
found a way out by giving liberty to the prosecution to proceed afresh,
under Section 196A of CrPC, 1898:

“The petitioners have been convicted under S. 120-B, I.P.C. Petitioner 1
has also been convicted under S. 384, I.P.C. and No. 2 under S. 384/114,
I.P.C. The ground upon which this rule has been issued is that the trial
was vitiated as the sanction contemplated by S. 196-A, Criminal P.C. had not been accorded by the Local Government to the prosecution of
the petitioners under S. 120-B, I.P.C. Now the object of the conspiracy
having been to commit an offence under S. 384, I.P.C., which is a non-
cognizable offence the Court could not take cognizance of the said offence
without the sanction of the Local Government or of the District Magistrate
empowered in that behalf. In the explanation which the learned Magistrate
has submitted in answer to the rule he has suggested that the convictions
under Ss. 384 and 384/114, I.P.C. as against the petitioners 1 and 2
respectively may be maintained and that the sentence passed on them may
be treated as having been passed under the said sections. Apart from
anything else, this course, in my opinion, is likely to result in prejudice to
the petitioners. They had been put on their trial in respect of offences under
Ss. 384 and 384/114 along with a charge under S. 120-B. It is just possible
and indeed it is not unlikely that a good deal of evidence that was adduced
on behalf of the prosecution in this case in order to establish the charge of
conspiracy would not be relevant as against the petitioners on the
substantive charges under Ss. 384 and 384/114, I.P.C. The trial held on
charges which do not require sanction along with such as are not
cognizable without sanction under S. 196-A, Criminal P. C., cannot be
separated in this way.
 
I am accordingly of opinion that this rule should be made absolute and the
convictions and sentences passed on the petitioners should be set aside and
the fines if paid by them should be refunded. It will be open to the
prosecution to proceed afresh against the petitioners in respect of the
charges under Ss. 384 and 384/114, I.P.C. or even as regards the
charge under S. 120-B, I.P.C. provided that the requisite sanction
under S. 196-A, Criminal P. C. has been duly obtained. Such retrial, if it
is to take place, will be held before some Magistrate other than the learned
Magistrate who has already dealt with this case.
 Rule made absolute.” 
 (emphasis supplied)
SUBMISSIONS
28.Mr. S.V. Raju, learned ASG appearing for the appellant submitted that as
the Act, 2019 had come into force, the impugned judgment is liable to be
set aside.

29., Mr. D. Mahesh Babu, learned counsel appearing for the
respondents, by placing reliance upon the written arguments submitted
that the impugned judgment correctly dealt with the legal position which
was prevailing at the relevant time. When the complaint was conveyed,
the CrPC, 1989 was in force. The repealing took place thereafter. The
retrospective application of a procedural law is fairly well settled, and the
procedure cannot be made retrospectively applicable. Even the Act, 2019
does not specifically state that the CrPC, 1973 will apply retrospectively.
On a conjoint reading of Section 103 of the Act, 2019, along with the
Order, 2019, with particular reference to Para 2(13)(d), it is abundantly
clear that the CrPC, 1989 ought to have been applied, as there was no
dispute with respect to the non-compliance, which was duly recorded by
the Court. Therefore, the impugned judgment will have to be sustained. 
DISCUSSION
30.As stated, CrPC, 1989 stood repealed with effect from 31.10.2019 (i.e. the
appointed day). On the very same day, the Act, 2019 came into existence.
Therefore, the submission of Mr. S.V. Raju, that there is no need for
getting the appropriate sanction or empowerment as mandated under
Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989 cannot be countenanced. 
31.There is nothing to infer either from the Act, 2019 or the Order, 2019 that
CrPC, 1973 will have a retrospective application. However, the Order,

2019 did take into consideration all the difficulties that might arise by
facilitating the continuance thereunder. We have no difficulty in holding
that while an investigation could continue after its initiation under the
CrPC, 1989, by way of the application of the CrPC, 1973, it cannot be
stated that even for a case where there was a clear non-compliance of the
former, it can be ignored by the application of the latter. 
32.Para 2(13) confers sufficient power on the investigating agency to deal
with such a situation. While we are holding that the requirement of an
authorization or an empowerment is mandatory for conveying a
complaint, it being at the conclusion of investigation, would not preclude
the investigating agency from complying with it thereafter. It is an
approval from an appropriate authority of the investigation having been
completed. We are not dealing with the case where an approval is
declined or rejected. Rather, it is a case where an authority has failed to
exercise the said power in granting an authorization. Thus, we are in
complete agreement with the reasoning adopted by the High Court of
Calcutta in Nibaran Chandra (supra).
33.If we were to hold that even by way of a prospective application,
notwithstanding the non-compliance under the CrPC, 1989, the appellant
shall be permitted to prosecute the respondents, we would only be
applying CrPC, 1973 retrospectively, which as discussed is not
permissible.

ON FACTS
34. On facts, it is an omission caused by the appellant which needs to be
rectified. It being a curable defect, would not enure to the benefit of the
respondents, particularly when they are yet to be charged in the absence
of such sanction or empowerment. At this stage, it is pertinent to reiterate
that the complaint was conveyed by the District Magistrate, Ramban to
the Special Judge, NIA on 20.09.2019. Further, the investigation stood
completed with the filing of the chargesheet on 25.09.2019. Whereas, the
appointed day for the Act, 2019 was 31.10.2019. Hence, on the day when
the investigation stood completed, the CrPC, 1989 was in force within the
Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir.
35.In such view of the matter, we are inclined to set aside the impugned
judgment insofar as it confirms the judgment of the Special Judge, NIA,
in not taking cognizance for the offence punishable under Section 120-B
of the RPC, 1989. Accordingly, we give liberty to the appellant to comply
with the mandate of Section 196-A of the CrPC, 1989, by seeking
appropriate authorization or empowerment as the case may be. Needless
to state, if such a compliance is duly made, then the Trial Court shall
undertake the exercise of taking cognizance, and proceed further with the
trial in accordance with law. 

36.The appeal is accordingly allowed in part. Pending Applications, if any,
stand disposed of...………………………..J.
