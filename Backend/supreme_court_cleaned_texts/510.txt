IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA 
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS.10970-10971 OF 2014 
 
STATE OF PUNJAB & ORS. 

VERSUS 
M/S PUNJAB SPINTEX LTD. 

JUDGMENT 
 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 
 
1. These appeals, by special leave, assail the 
correctness of the judgment and orders dated 
27.01.2010 and 24.09.2010 passed by the 
Punjab & Haryana High Court, respectively in 
 
of 2010 in the Writ Petition. 
2. The matter pertains to exemption from payment 
of Market fee and Rural Development fee sought 
by the Respondent herein. The Respondent 
company was incorporated on 26.12.2006 and 
set up a spinning unit at Bathinda for 
manufacturing cotton yarn out of raw cotton. 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

Thereafter, the Respondent company applied to 
the Appellant for grant of exemption from paying 
Market fee and Rural Development fee in terms 
of the Industrial Policy, 20031 and claimed to be 
similarly situated as M/s Partap Furane Pvt. 
Ltd., which is also engaged in the manufacturing 
of cotton yarn, and was granted exemption from 
payment of Market fee. 
3. Respondent filed 
before the High Court of Punjab & Haryana 
seeking such exemption. Therein, in response to 
the notice issued, the Counsel for the State 
produced the minutes of meetings of the 
Empowered 
Committee 
held 
under 
the 
Chairmanship of the Chief Minister, Punjab, on 
17.12.2009, which has been reproduced as 
follows: 
“i). 
Integrated 
Cotton 
Ginning 
and 
Spinning Units which have not sought 
the status of Mega Projects would be 
eligible 
for 
incentives 
under 
the 
Industrial 
Policy, 
2003, 
including 
exemption from payment of market fee 
as per Para 11.4.2(i). This would be for 
 
1 2003 Policy, hereinafter 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

a period of ten years from the date of 
issue of the notification. a. 
Units that have availed of the 
benefit under the Mega Projects Scheme 
but have now sought benefits under the 
2003 Policy e.g. Cotton Units seeking 
exemption from market fee, would be 
eligible for incentives and concessions 
only under one specific package i.e. ether the Industrial Policy of 2003 or the 
standard package of the incentives of 
Mega Projects finalized in November, 
2007 as per their choice." 
 
4. The High Court, vide impugned order dated 
27.01.2010, dismissed the Writ Petition in the 
following manner: 
“ 
xxx 
xxx 
4. Learned counsel for the State also states 
that Market Fee will also cover Rural 
Development Fee and further action as 
per above decision will be taken within 
one month. 
5. In view of above, learned counsel for the 
petitioner does not press this petition at 
this stage. 
6. Dismissed as not pressed.” 
 
5. Thereafter, the Appellant, being aggrieved by the 
aforesaid statement made by the Counsel on 
instructions, filed C.M. No. 3144 of 2010 in CWP 
No. 14847 of 2009 seeking modification in order 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

dated 27.01.2010. In the application, the 
Appellant stated that the earlier statement made 
by the counsel for the State, on the instructions 
from the officers of the Industry department, 
stating that the Market fee would also cover the 
Rural Development fee, was not factually and 
legally correct. It was further argued that Market 
fee was collected under the provisions of Punjab 
Agricultural 
Produce 
Markets 
Act, 

whereas the Rural Development fee is collected 
under the Punjab Rural Development Act, 19873. 
Therefore, both the fees being separate, decision 
on 
exemption 
from 
Market 
fee 
did 
not 
automatically apply to Rural Development fee. 
6. In 
reply 
to 
the 
application, 
Respondent 
submitted that even according to the Agriculture 
Department of the Government of Punjab, 
exemption from Market fee automatically covers 
Rural Development fee and annexed letters dated 
09.10.2001, 28.08.2001 and 10.09.2001 to 
supply weight to their arguments. The High 
Court, vide order dated 24.09.2010, observed 
 
2 1961 Act, hereinafter 
3 1987 Act, hereinafter 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

that the abovementioned letters clearly support 
the stand earlier taken on behalf of the State and 
thus, there is no ground for modification sought. 
The application was dismissed accordingly. 
Aggrieved by the said orders, the Appellant State 
is before us. 
7. The core issue of the matter boils down to 
whether the exemption from payment of Market 
fee granted under Clause (i) of 11.4.2 of 2003 
Policy of the Punjab Government can be said to 
include exemption from Rural Development fee 
as well or not. 
8. Before proceeding any further, the relevant 
statutory provisions may be noticed. 
9. Market Fee is levied under Section 23 of the 1961 
Act which is as follows: 
“23. Levy of fees. – A Committee may, 
subject to such rules as may be made 
by the State Government in this behalf, 
levy on advalorem basis fees on the 
agricultural produce bought or sold by 
licensees in the notified market area [at 
the rate of [one rupee and fifty Paise]] for 
every one hundred rupees: 
 
Provided that- 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

 no fee shall be leviable in respect of any 
transaction in which delivery of the 
agricultural produce bought or sold is 
not actually made; and 
a fee shall be leviable only on the 
parties to a transaction in which 
delivery is actually made.” 
 
10. Rural Development Fund is levied under Section 
5 of the 1987 Act and the constitution of fund is 
dealt under Section 6. The relevant provisions 
are as follows: 
“Section 5 - Levy and collection of fee 
Subject to the rules made under this 
Act, there shall be levied for the purpose 
of this Act, a fee on ad valoram basis, at 
the rate of rupees two for every one 
hundred rupees, in respect of the 
agricultural produce, bought or sold in 
the notified market area. 
 
(2) The fee levied under sub-section (1) 
shall be paid by the dealer in such 
manner as may be prescribed and shall 
be realised by a Market Committee 
established 
under 
the 
Punjab 
Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1961 
(Punjab Act 23 of 1961): 
 
Provided that the burden of the fee 
shall be passed on by the dealer by 
adding it to the purchase price 
recoverable by him from the next 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

purchaser 
of 
the 
agricultural 
produce or the goods processed or 
manufactured out of it. 
[(2-A) If any dealer fails to pay the 
amount of the fee levied under sub- 
section (1), he shall, in addition to 
the amount of fee be liable to pay 
interest on the amount of fee due 
from him at the rate of eighteen per 
centum per annum from the date of 
default.] 
 
(3) The arrears of fee levied under sub-
section (1) shall be recoverable as 
arrears of land revenue. 
 
Section 6 – Constitution of Fund 
(1) There shall be constituted a fund to be 
called the Punjab Rural Development 
Fund which shall vest in the Board. 
 
(2) The Fund constituted under sub-
section (1) shall be administered by 
such officer or officers of the Board as 
may be appointed by it in this behalf. 
 
(3) The amount of fee (realised by a Market 
Committee 
established 
under 
the 
Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets 
Act, 1961 (Punjab Act 23 of 1961)] 
under sub-section (2) of section 5 shall 
be credited to the Fund within such 
period as may be prescribed and the 
grants from the [State Government and 
Local Authorities and the loans raised 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

by the Board under section 5-A] shall 
also be credited to this Fund.” 

11. The relevant provisions of the 2003 Policy under 
which such exemptions have been sought are 
reproduced as follows: 
“11.4 Development of Agro & Food 
Processing Industry 
11.4.1 Definition 
For the purpose of this policy, Agro-
Food Processing Industries would mean 
an activity involved in the production of 
value added/high end products from 
primary 
agricultural/horticultural 
crops 
including 
floriculture 
& 
vegetables and their residues available 
in the State. It will also include 
cultivation 
of 
processing/superior 
quality & high yielding varieties of all 
kinds of crops and their post-harvest 
operations such as cleaning, grading, 
packaging, 
storage, 
transportation, 
marketing etc. The extent of value 
addition should be atleast 50% of the 
basic value. However, this will not 
include rice, pulse and cereal mills, 
decorticating, 
expelling, 
crushing, 
roasting 
and 
frying 
of 
oil 
seeds, 
preparing of bread other than by 
mechanised 
bakery, 
refining 
and 
hydrogenation of edible oils, including 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

manufacture 
of 
Vanaspati. 
It 
will 
further include the non-molasses based 
alcohol plants. 
11.4.2 Incentives 
(i) For agriculture commodities other than 
wheat and paddy no market fees shall 
be levied on purchases made by agro 
and food processing units. 
(ii) Similarly for commodities other than 
wheat and paddy purchased by food and 
agro processing units, no Rural output 
tax shall be charged. 
 
…” 
12. Heard learned counsel for the parties and 
perused the material on record. 
13. Learned Counsel appearing for the Appellant 
State argued that the Market fees under the 1961 
Act and Rural Development fees under the 1987 
Act are two different “fees” levied under two 
different Acts having different objects and 
purpose. That the 2003 Policy does not 
specifically exempt Rural Development fees and 
therefore, such an assumption cannot be made 
by the Respondent. Further, it was submitted 
that there are various industries that are 
exempted from Market fees and not exempted 
from Rural Development fees, including the 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

company M/s Partap Furane Pvt. Ltd. with which 
a similarity as being claimed by the Respondent. 
14. On the other hand, Mr. Aman Lekhi, Ld. Senior 
Counsel appearing for the Respondent argued 
that the expression ‘Market fees’ has been used 
in the Policy of 2003 because both the 1961 Act 
and the 1987 Act contemplate levy of fees in a 
notified market area and not in the sense of fees 
levied under the 1961 Act as has been argued by 
the Appellant State. Respondent has extensively 
argued that there is a clear convergence of 
interests of both the 1961 Act and 1987 Act and 
that the 2003 Policy exempts the recovery of the 
fees under both laws as incentives for the 
Development of Agro and Food Processing 
Industries. 
15. Respondent further argued that the High Court 
had rightly dismissed the application for review 
of the Order dated 27.01.2010 by relying upon 
Note dated 28.08.2001 which was issued by the 
Punjab Rural Development Board, Chandigarh 
(recording therein the decision of the Chief 
Minister of Punjab) that exemption on an item 
from Market fees will automatically be extended 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

to fees under the 1987 Act. Since the Respondent 
relied heavily on the Note dated 28.08.2001 
before us as well as the High Court, it becomes 
pertinent for the State to duly counter such 
submission. 
16. In this regard, the State submitted that the 
letters 
dated 
28.08.2001, 
09.10.2001, 
10.09.2001 are clarified with the letters dated 
02.11.2010 and 21.02.2011 respectively. The 
Letter dated 02.11.2010 has been issued by the 
Department of Agriculture referring to the Govt. 
Memo dated 09.10.2001 and states that it has 
been found that the letter dated 09.10.2001 was 
not issued with the approval of the Competent 
Authority and is accordingly withdrawn. 
17. Further, the Memo dated 21.02.2011 is another 
letter issued by the Department of Agriculture 
which also refers to the earlier memo dated 
02.11.2010. The relevant parts of the latter 
memo are reproduced below: 
“… … 
…. 
…. 
… 
4. It is clarified that because in the 
recovery of Rural Development Fee, the 
rules regarding recovery of Market Fee 
are 
applicable 
Mutatis 
Mutandis, 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

therefore, the items which are directly 
exempted under certain conditions i.e: 
under rule 29 and 30, the same will be 
applicable in the recovery of Rural 
Development Fee, meaning that the 
exemption will be applicable on Rural 
Development Fee on the same items. 
 
5. Besides, the exemption from Market 
fee under rules 30-C, is also granted by 
the State Govt. in exercise of the powers 
on case to case basis through a separate 
notification. Such cases are mainly 
covered under Industrial Policy 2003 or 
Guidelines for Mega projects 2007. 
Under these concessions, eligible units 
can be exempted from Market Fee or both 
from Market Fee and Rural Development 
Fee. In such cases, exemption from 
Market Fee will not be automatically 
applicable on Rural Development Fee, 
rather, 
the 
exemption 
from 
Rural 
Development Fee will applicable if the 
competent authority issues a specific 
order/ notification in this respect.” 
 
18. However, the Respondent was quick to bring to 
our notice that the communication dated 
02.11.2010 only withdraws the Memo dated 
09.10.2001 and not the Note dated 28.08.2001. 
Further, it was also argued that the Appellant’s 
reliance on communication dated 21.02.2011 is 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

wholly misconceived as that communication is 
subsequent to the petition of the Respondent 
being disposed of by the High Court. 
19. It is clear that the issue as to whether the 2003 
Policy only grants exemption from the Market 
fees as levied under the 1961 Act and does not 
grant exemption from the Rural Development 
fees under the 1987 Act, has not been 
adjudicated by the High Court on merits. The 
said adjudication could not happen as the 
Counsel for the State had stated before the High 
Court that Market fee will also cover Rural 
Development fee and the High Court dismissed 
the petition as not pressed. This is pertinently 
where the trail of errors began. However, it did 
not come to an end over there. Even in the 
modification application preferred by the State, 
the High Court failed to delve into the merits of 
the matter and rather instantly went on to rely 
on the letters dated 09.10.2001, 28.08.2001 and 
10.09.2001 referred by the Respondent, thereby 
dismissing the application for modification. The 
High Court, only recorded the submissions of the 
State counsel and thereafter referring to the three 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

notes/letters 
of 

of 
the 
Agriculture 
Department and dismissed the application. 
Neither the arguments were discussed and 
analysed nor the contents of three notes/letters 
were discussed. 
Scope of exemption under the 2003 Policy 
20. Appellant State had argued that the Market fees 
and Rural Development fees are collected under 
two different statutes which have two different 
objects and the said Acts have different purposes 
for utilization of the fees collected under the 
respective Acts. Whereas, the Respondent does 
not deny the fact that the fees are distinct under 
two separate statutes, yet they emphatically 
argued that both the Acts have intersecting 
statutory provisions and an overlap in the 
purpose and object of the two statutes shows a 
clear convergence of interests of both the Acts 
and therefore, the term “Market fees” in the 2003 
Policy exempts recovery of the fees under both 
the 1961 Act and 1987 Act. 
21. We note that the Appellant has correctly pointed 
out that the two Acts have different objects. The 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

preamble of 1961 Act clearly stipulates that it is 
a statute to provide for law relating to better 
regulation of purchase, sale, storage and 
processing of agricultural produce and for 
establishment of markets in the State. Whereas, 
the 1987 Act, on the other hand, is enacted for 
providing relief for the loss of agricultural 
produce, 
accelerating 
rural 
development, 
improve facilities for purchasers of agricultural 
produce and augment agricultural production. 
Rural Development Fund is admittedly collected 
by the Market Committees, but forms part of the 
Rural Development Fund constituted under 
Section 6 of 1987 Act. 
22. It is not uncommon for different statutes, 
concerning 
similar 
area 
of 
law, 
to 
have 
convergence 
of 
interests 
to 
some 
degree. 
However, this would not imply that benefits 
extended to one statute will be presumed to flow 
to the other statute as well. 
23. The 2003 Policy does not specifically exempt 
Rural Development fees and therefore, such an 
argument 
by 
the 
Respondent 
is 
highly 
presumptive, far-fetched and a clear attempt at 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

over-reaching the scope of the 2003 Policy. If 
such an assumption is allowed, it would 
considerably 
broaden 
the 
canvas 
of 
the 
incentives available under the 2003 Policy, which 
was never intended. In fact, such a loose 
interpretation of the State policies would lead to 
an ambiguity to the State’s intent and render it 
opposite to the public policy. 
24. In view of the aforesaid, holding that the 
exemption from Market fees is inclusive of Rural 
Development fees shall be contrary to the 
statutory provisions and objective behind both 
the Acts as well as the 2003 Policy. Thereby, the 
two fees cannot be equated or assumed to be 
same or similar for the purposes of exemption. 
Effect of communication made by the State via 
various notes/letters 
25. As mentioned before, the Respondent has heavily 
relied on letters dated 09.10.2001, 28.08.2001 
and 10.09.2001 published by the Department of 
Agriculture to seek such an exemption. The 
Appellant has submitted before us that the letter 
dated 28.08.2001 was only issued by the office 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

Superintendent in the Appellant’s office and was 
not a decision by the Government and has 
consequently been withdrawn as not being an 
authorized letter vide letter dated 02.11.2010. 
26. It is apparent that the letter dated 02.11.2010 
has 
been 
issued 
by 
the 
Department 
of 
Agriculture and duly withdrew the Note dated 
09.10.2001. With regard to the Respondent’s 
argument that the letter dated 28.08.2001 still 
remains applicable as not explicitly withdrawn, 
we note that the Memo dated 09.10.2001 itself 
referred and relied upon Note dated 28.08.2001 
and, hence, any subsequent communication 
withdrawing Memo dated 09.10.2001 shall ipso 
facto apply to the earlier referred letters as well 
including the note dated 28.08.2001. 
27. In furtherance, the Department of Agriculture 
has also issued a Memo dated 21.02.2011 to 
clarify and reiterate that when exemption from 
Market fees is granted, as in the instant case, 
such exemption will not be automatically 
applicable on Rural Development fee. Therefore, 
the Respondent’s reliance on such earlier letters, 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

improper as they were, will not help them claim 
exemption from Rural Development fee. 
28. From an in-depth analysis of the statutes and 
policies produced before us, it is apparent that 
no unit, other than those approved as Mega 
Project, has been allowed exemption from the 
payment of Rural Development fee, unless 
explicitly provided by the authorities. The 
Respondent herein, M/s Punjab Spintex Limited, 
has admittedly not been approved as a Mega 
Project and, therefore, not eligible for such 
exemption from Rural Development fee. 
Conclusion 
29. We accordingly hold that the Market fees and 
Rural Development fees are distinct and, there 
being no exemption from Rural Development fees 
mentioned 
in 
the 

Policy, 
it 
only 
encompasses exemption from Market fees in its 
ambit. The two fees under the two different 
statutory frameworks cannot be equated as one 
by the Respondent and they cannot assume that 
exemption from “Market fees” would subsume in 
itself “Rural Development fees” also. 

Civil Appeal Nos. 10970-10971 of 2014 

30. Accordingly, the appeals are allowed. The 
impugned 
orders 
dated 
27.01.2010 
and 
24.09.2010 are set aside. of 
2009 is dismissed as being bereft of any merits. 
31. Pending application(s), if any, is disposed of.
