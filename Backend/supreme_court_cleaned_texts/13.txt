VERSUS 
 
USHA SONI 

JUDGMENT 
 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 
 
Leave granted. 
 
2. These two appeals raise a common question of 
law. As such they are being analogously dealt 

SLP ( 

with by this common order. The challenge in both 
these appeals is to the orders passed by the 
National 
Consumer 
Disputes 
Redressal 
Commission1, New Delhi, whereby the revision 
filed by the appellant has since been dismissed 
and the orders passed by the District Forum as 
also the State Commission have been affirmed 
holding that the appellant is liable to pay the 
amount of the sum assured on the death of the 
assured. 
3. The sole question involved in these appeals is as 
to what would be the date from which the policy 
becomes effective; whether it would be the date 
on which the policy is issued or the date of the 
commencement mentioned in the policy or it 
would be the date of the issuance of the deposit 
receipt or cover note. The District Consumer 
Disputes Redressal Forum2, the State Consumer 
Disputes 
Redressal 
Commission3 
and 
the 
National Commission have proceeded on the 
basis that the date of issuance of the initial 
 
1 NCDRC 
2 District Forum 
3 State Commission 

SLP ( 

deposit receipt of premium is the date of 
commencement 
of 
the 
Policy 
and 
have 
accordingly allowed the complaint filed by the 
respondent. 
 
4. The relevant dates in both the cases are 
summarised hereunder: 
4.1. In the appeal of Jaya Wadhwani, the 
quotation 
of 
Policy 
was 
issued 
on 
14.07.2012. 
The 
proposal 
form 
was 
submitted by the life assured on 14.07.2012. 
Receipt of the Cheque dated 13.07.2012 was 
also issued on 14.07.2012. On 16.07.2012, 
the Policy was issued and at all relevant 
places, it was mentioned in the policy that the 
date of commencement of the policy would be 
16.07.2012. On 15.07.2013, the life assured 
committed suicide. 
 
4.2. In the appeal of Usha Soni, the date of 
submission of proposal form by the life 
assured is 26.09.2012. The date of issue of 
policy as also the date of commencement of 
policy was 28.09.2012. The date of next 

SLP ( 

premium due was 28.09.2013. As the next 
premium was not paid, the policy lapsed. The 
assured 
paid 
the 
next 
premium 
on 
25.02.2014 and the lapsed policy was 
reinstated from that date. On 03.06.2014, 
the life assured committed suicide. 
 
5. The Clause relevant for consideration is clause 9 
of the Policy conditions and privileges and the 
terms and conditions mentioned therein. Clause 
9 reads as follows: 
“9. Suicide: The Company will not pay 
any claim on death if the Life Assured, 
whether sane or insane, commits suicide 
within 12 months from the date of issue 
of this Policy or the date of any 
reinstatement of this Policy.” 

6. From the documents on record in the case of 
Usha Soni, we find that the first cheque was 
issued on 26.09.2012. The policy issuance and 
commencement date in the Policy is mentioned 
as 28.09.2012. Further, the next premium due 
was on 28.09.2013. Grace period is 30 days 
under Clause 1(iv) of the terms and conditions. 
Clause 5 mentions that the policy would lapse. 

SLP ( 

Clause 6 provides for reinstatement. However, 
since the renewal amount was not paid within 
the time allowed, the policy stood lapsed and 
subsequently, upon payment of the premium 
against the lapsed policy on 25.02.2014, the 
policy was reinstated from the said date. The life 
assured committed suicide on 03.06.2014, which 
was well within the period of 12 months. 
 
7. On a perusal of the orders passed by the District 
Forum, the State Commission, and the National 
Commission, we find that although clause 9 of 
the terms and conditions has been referred to but 
the aspect of reinstatement of a lapsed Policy has 
not been considered. They have wrongly taken 
the date of issue of policy only as the relevant 
date to count 12 months, i.e., from 28.09.2012. 
 
8. Once it is mentioned in the Policy that the 12 
months period is to commence from the date of 
the issuance of the policy or the date of any 
reinstatement of the policy, the reinstatement 
aspect ought to have been considered. The date 
of reinstatement of the policy is clearly stated to 

SLP ( 

be 25.02.2014 and that is also the date of 
commencement of policy, both the dates being 
the same. Thus, the date of incidence of suicide 
being 03.06.2014, it was well within 12 months. 
 
9. Now, coming to the case of Jaya Wadhwani, the 
proposal form, no doubt, was submitted on 
14.07.2012 with respect to the cheque dated 
13.07.2012 of the premium amount wherein also 
it was mentioned that the receipt is issued 
subject to the clearance of the cheque and 
further that the insurance protection shall only 
be provided effective from the date of acceptance 
of the risk, which happened on 16.07.2012, 
when the policy was issued and the date of 
commencement was notified to be the same date. 
 
10. 14th July 2012, therefore, cannot be taken to be 
the date of issuance of policy. It is only the date 
of issue of receipt of the initial premium. The date 
of issue of policy being 16.07.2012 is actually the 
date from which the policy commences and 
becomes effective. 

SLP ( 

11. In the present case, period of 12 months from 
16.07.2012 will complete on 15.07.2013. It 
would be the last day of 12 months as from the 
next day, i.e., 16.07.2013 the next month will 
start. Unfortunately, the incidence of suicide is 
on 15.07.2013, the last day of 12 months. The 
date of proposal cannot be treated to be the date 
of policy until and unless on the date of proposal, 
initial deposit as also the issuance of policy 
happens on the same date where, for example, 
the premium is paid in cash then, immediately, 
the policy could be issued. Merely, tendering a 
cheque may not be enough as till such time the 
cheque is encashed, the contract would not 
become effective. The drawer of the cheque may, 
at any time, after issuing, stop its payment or 
there may not be enough funds in the account of 
which the cheque is issued and there could be 
many other reasons for which the cheque could 
be returned without being encashed. 
 
12. We may also refer to the two judgments relied 
upon by the counsel for the appellants, in 
support of his submission that the terms and 

SLP ( 

conditions of the contract as contained in the 
policy should be strictly adhered to. Otherwise 
mentioning of the terms and conditions would be 
a futile exercise, if any other interpretation is 
given or terms and conditions are relaxed. 
 
13. In this connection, it would be useful to 
reproduce the extract which form part of 
paragraph 6 in the case of Life Insurance 
Corporation of India and Another vs. Dharam 
Vir Anand4. It reads as follows: 
 
“6. 
Having 
examined 
the 
rival 
submissions and having examined the 
policy of insurance which is nothing 
but a contract between the parties and 
having considered the expressions 
used in Clause 4-B of the terms of the 
policy, we are persuaded to accept the 
submissions made by Mr. Salve, the 
learned Senior Counsel appearing for 
the 
appellant. 
In 
construing 
a 
particular Clause of the Contract, it is 
only reasonable to construe that the 
words and the terms used therein 
must be given effect to. In other words, 
one part of the Contract cannot be 
made otiose by giving a meaning to the 
policy of the contract. Then again, 
when the same Clause of a contract 
 
4 (1998) 

SLP ( 

uses 
two 
different 
expressions, 
ordinarily those different expressions 
convey different meanings and both 
the expressions cannot be held to be 
conveying one and the same meaning. 
Bearing 
in 
mind 
the 
aforesaid 
principle of construction, if Clause 4-
B of the terms of policy is scrutinized, 
it become crystal clear that the date 
on which the risk under the policy has 
commenced is different from the date 
of the policy. In the case in hand, 
undoubtedly the date on which the 
risk under the policy has commenced 
is 10.5.89 but the date of the policy is 
31.03.1990 on which date the policy 
had been issued. Even though the 
Insurer had given the option to the 
Insured to indicate as to whether the 
policy is to be dated back and the 
insured indicated that the policy 
should be dated back to 10.05.1989 
and did pay the premium for that 
period, thereby the risk under the 
policy can be said to have commenced 
with effect from 10.5.1989 but the 
date of the policy still remains the date 
on which the policy was issued i.e. 
31.03.1990. The death of the life 
assured having occurred as a result of 
suicide committed by the assured 
before the expiry of three years from 
the date of the policy, the terms 
contained in Clause 4-B of the policy 
would be attracted and, therefore, the 
liability of the Corporation would be 
limited to the sum equal to the total 
amount of premium paid under the 

SLP ( 

policy without interest and not the 
entire sum for which the life had been 
insured. 
The 
Forums 
under 
the Consumer 
Protection 
Act committed 
gross 
error 
in 
construing Clause 4-B of the policy 
and giving the same meaning to the 
two expressions in the aforesaid 
Clause 4-B namely "the date on which 
the 
risk 
under 
the 
policy 
has 
commenced" and “the date of the 
policy". The construction given by us 
to the provisions contained in Clause 
4-B get support, if the proviso to 
Clause 4-B is looked into. Under the 
proviso, if the life assured commits 
suicide before expiry of one year 
reckoned from the date of the policy, 
then the provisions of the Clause 
under the heading "suicide" printed 
on the back of the policy would apply. 
In a case therefore where a policy is 
dated back for one year prior to the 
date of the issue of the policy, the 
proviso contained in Clause 4-B 
cannot be operated at all. When 
parties had agreed to the terms of the 
contract, it is impermissible to hold 
that a particular term was never 
intended to be acted upon. The 
proviso to Clause 4-B will have its full 
play if the expression "the date of the 
policy" is interpreted to mean the date 
on which the policy was issued and 
not the date on which the risk under 
the policy has commenced. In the 
aforesaid premises, we are of the 
considered opinion that under Clause 

SLP ( 

4-B of the policy the date of the policy 
is the date on which the policy had 
been issued and not the date on which 
the 
risk 
under 
the 
policy 
had 
commenced by way of allowing it to be 
dated back. In view of our aforesaid 
construction to Clause 4-B, in the 
case in hand, the respondent in law 
would be entitled to only the sum 
equal to the total amount of premium 
paid under the policy without any 
interest inasmuch as the death of the 
life assured has occurred before the 
expiry of three years from the date of 
the policy, i.e., 31.3.1990… 
………” 
 
14. Relying upon the above judgment in the case of 
Dharam Vir Anand (supra), this Court again in 
the case of Life Insurance Corpn. of India vs. 
Mani Ram5, reiterated the same view and held 
that the date of issue of policy would be the 
relevant date even if there was backdating as has 
been done in the case of Dharam Vir Anand 
(supra). 
 
15. In the present appeals, we do not find any such 
issue of back dating but the date of issuance of 
the policy would be the relevant date for all the 
 
5 (2005) 

SLP ( 

purposes and not the date of proposal or the date 
of issuance of the receipt. In view of the above, 
the stand taken by the appellant is approved. The 
impugned orders are thus liable to be set aside. 
 
16. Accordingly, the orders passed by the District 
Forum, the State Commission, and the National 
Commission are set aside and the claims of the 
respondent are rejected. The appeals are 
accordingly, allowed as above. 
 
17. There shall be no order as to costs.
