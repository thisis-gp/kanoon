Review Petition (Civil) No 359 of 2023
in

Union of India & Anr...Petitioner(s)

VERSUS

M/s Ganpati Dealcom Pvt Ltd...Respondent(s)
 
ORDER

We have heard Mr Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the
Union of India, and Mr Ajay Vohra, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
respondent.

The review has been sought in these proceedings of the judgment of a three-
Judge Bench of this Court in Union of India and Another v Ganpati Dealcom
Private Ltd1. The only question which was framed for consideration by this
Court was in the following terms:
“3. 
The short legal question which arises for this Court's
consideration is whether the Prohibition of Benami
Property Transactions Act, 1988 (for short “the 1988
Act”), as amended by the Benami Transactions
(Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 (for short “the 2016
Act”) has a prospective effect. Although a purely legal
question arises in this appeal, it is necessary to have a
brief factual background in mind before we advert to the
analysis.”
1 (2023) 

The conclusion which was arrived at by the Court, was in the following terms:
“127.1.Section 3(2) (sic Section 3) of the unamended 1988
Act is declared as unconstitutional for being manifestly
arbitrary. Accordingly, Section 3(2) of the 2016 Act is
also unconstitutional as it is violative of Article 20(1) of
the Constitution.
127.2. In rem forfeiture provision under Section 5 of the
unamended 1988 Act, prior to the 2016 Amendment
Act, was unconstitutional for being manifestly
arbitrary.
127.3. The 2016 Amendment Act was not merely procedural,
rather, prescribed substantive provisions.
127.4. In rem forfeiture provision under Section 5 of the 2016
Act, being punitive in nature, can only be applied
prospectively and not retroactively. 
127.5. The authorities concerned cannot initiate or continue
criminal prosecution or confiscation proceedings for
transactions entered into prior to the coming into force
of the 2016 Act viz. 25-10-2016. As a consequence of
the above declaration, all such prosecutions or
confiscation proceedings shall stand quashed. 
127.6. As this Court is not concerned with the
constitutionality of such independent forfeiture
proceedings contemplated under the 2016
Amendment Act on the other grounds, the aforesaid
questions are left open to be adjudicated in
appropriate proceedings.”

The Court has declared Section 3(2) of the unamended provisions of the
Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act 1988 as unconstitutional for
being manifestly arbitrary and as violative of Article 20(1) of the Constitution.
The provisions of Section 5 of the unamended Act, prior to the Amendment of
2016, have been declared to be unconstitutional on the ground that they are
manifestly arbitrary.

It is not disputed that there was no challenge to the constitutional validity of the
unamended provisions. This is also clear from the formulation of the question

which arose for consideration before the Bench in paragraph 3 of the judgment,
which has been extracted above. In the submissions of parties which have been
recorded in the judgment, the issue of constitutional validity was not squarely
addressed. 

A challenge to the constitutional validity of a statutory provision cannot be
adjudicated upon in the absence of a lis and contest between the parties. We
accordingly allow the review petition and recall the judgment dated 23 August
2022. Civil Appeal No 5783 of 2022 shall stand restored to file for fresh
adjudication before a Bench to be nominated by the Chief Justice of India on the
administrative side.

Where any other proceedings have been disposed of by relying on the judgment
of this Court in Ganpati Dealcom Private Ltd (supra), liberty is granted to the
aggrieved party to seek a review in view of the present judgment.

Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.
