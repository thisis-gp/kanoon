ORDER 
 
A. Heard learned Amicus, Mr. Siddharth Luthra, Senior Advocate Mr. Gaurav Agarwal 
for National Legal Services Authority (hereinafter referred to as “NALSA”) and 
Additional Solicitor General of India, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati for the Union. 
 
B. We have perused the compliance affidavits filed by the respective States, Union 
Territories, Central Bureau of Investigation and NALSA on the directions issued by 

this Court in the Judgment reported in Satender Kumar Antil v. Central Bureau of 
Investigation, (2022) and the periodical orders passed therein. The 
learned Amicus having gone through these compliance affidavits in great detail has 
submitted a tabular chart and report dated 10.02.2024 indicating the directions that 
have been complied with by the parties present before us in terms of the judgment 
passed by this Court in Satender Kumar Antil (Supra) case. 
 
C. For the comprehensive implementation of the directions in Satender Kumar Antil 
(Supra) case, the Amicus upon thorough study and verification of the details 
forcefully argues that certain directions fall within the domain of States/Union 
Territories/CBI, and High Courts and a few directions fall within the domain of both 
the States and the High Courts. Therefore, for effective monitoring by this Court it 
is completely desirable to combine the stake holders for reporting in a convenient 
way and are heard on a particular day. 
 
D. The directions contained in para 100.2, 100.4, 100.7 of Satender Kumar Antil 
(Supra) and also the directions to public prosecutors in terms of order dated 
21.03.2023 of this Court need top most attention and are required to be complied 
with by States, Union Territories and CBI as per the time schedule stipulated. 

E. So far as the directions in para 100.2, 100.3, 100.5, 100.6, 100.7, 100.8, 100.9, 
100.10, 100.11 of Satender Kumar Antil (Supra); the direction dated 03.02.2023 for 
inclusion of the judgment in Siddharth v. State of UP, (2022) and 
Satender Kumar Antil (Supra) in the curriculum of judicial academies and the 
direction dated 21.03.2023 for application of the judgment in Satender Kumar Antil 
(Supra) to Section 438 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to 
as “CrPC”), by and large apply to High Courts. From a larger perspective, direction 
in a few paragraphs is complied with by both i.e. the States/Union Territories and 
High Courts, in consultation with each other. The suggestion of Amicus informs that 
directions individually obligated are carried out independently and where mutual 
consultation in complying with the directions is necessary, such consultation is 
undertaken 
and 
responsibility 
is 
fixed 
on 
one 
authority 
for 
due 
compliance. 
 
F. The report dated 10.02.2024 is accepted by us in its entirety and therefore, now we 
issue directions for due compliance by the States/Union Territories/CBI and High 
Courts. For the sake of convenience, the directions to various States and Union 
Territories are issued and we wish to verify and deal with the compliance in the 
manner suggested by this Order.

exchanged simultaneously. Considering the convenience of all parties present here, 
we accept the suggestion so made and accordingly give liberty to the learned amicus 
to create the email id, and circulate the same to all the counsel/parties. Email id shall 
be used hereafter for serving and receiving affidavits / reports.
