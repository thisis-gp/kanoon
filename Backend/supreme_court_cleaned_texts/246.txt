& ANOTHER 

JUDGMENT 
 
BELA M. TRIVEDI, J. 
 
1. Leave granted. 
2. The Appellant – Level 9 BIZ Pvt. Ltd., who was not a party to the 
proceedings, being, filed by the 
Respondent No.2 – M/s. Vasu Constructions in the High Court of 
Himachal Pradesh at Shimla, has challenged the impugned order dated 
18.10.2022 passed by the High Court in the said proceedings. The High 

Court passed the impugned order disposing of the said CWP by merely 
accepting the statement made on behalf of the Respondent No.1 – 
Himachal Pradesh Housing and Urban Development Authority 
(HIMUDA) that it wanted to withdraw the cancellation of initial tendering 
process order dated 05.02.2021, and the statement made on behalf of 
the Respondent No. 2 that it was ready to execute the project on the 
same terms and conditions and the rates as per the initial tender dated 
15.11.2018, though the said tender was already withdrawn by the 
Respondent no. 1 HIMUDA in view of the irregularities and illegalities 
committed by it, as recorded by an independent committee appointed 
by the High Court in earlier writ petitions filed by the present appellant 
and one Dalip S. Rathore. 
3. The broad facts giving rise to the present appeal may be stated as 
under: - 
DATES 
 EVENTS 
15/16.11.2018 Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) was issued by HIMUDA (R-1) for the 
construction of proposed commercial complex of Vikas Nagar, 
Shimla, at estimated cost of Rs.45,05,62,074/- 
15.12.2018 
Technical Bids were opened and on the same day Financial Bids 
were also opened. (Appellant & R-2 were the only found to be 
qualified – But the Appellant was L2) 
17.12.2018 
LOI was issued by the R-1 in favour of R-2. 
24.12.2018 
One Unsuccessful bidder Dalip S Rathore filed Writ Petition being 
CWP 3021 of 2018 challenging the technical specifications & 

ineligibility of Respondent No.2, also seeking cancellation of the 
Tender. The High Court issued notice. 
02.01.2019 
R-1 HIMUDA withdrew the LOI dated 17.12.2018 of R-2 M/S Vasu 
Constructions stating that the case is pending in the High Court 
and the work will be awarded only as per the decision of the High 
Court. 
05.01.2019 
R-1 HIMUDA constituted a committee, which reviewed the tender 
process and concluded that there were many lapses which 
warranted actions against the erring officials. 
07.01.2019 
Another Committee constituted by R-1 submitted a report that 
Shri Dalip Singh was not qualified and M/s. Vasu Constructions 
was qualified. 
23.02.2019 
Appellant – Level 9 BIZ Pvt. Ltd. filed a writ petition CWP 363 of 
2019, praying for rejection of Technical Bid and Financial Bid of 
the R-2 M/s. Vasu Constructions 
25.11.2020 
High Court passed a detailed order on 25.11.2020 in CWP No. 
3021/2018 and 363/2019. 
 
In Para 29 High Court observed- 
 
“[..] this Court is prima facie of the view that 
some of the officers manning high positions in 
HIMUDA have not acted responsibly and in the 
interest of organization, rather have attempted, 
directly or indirectly, to give undue benefit to 
some of the contractors. Having seen the 
record, this Court is compelled to draw a 
conclusion that the officers responsible for 
evaluation of the tender in question, did not 
scrutinize the documents submitted by the 
tenderers along with their bids properly and, with 
a view to ensure ouster of some eligible 
contractors and awarding the same to their 
favourites, have made an attempt to justify their 
action by giving totally implausible reasoning.” 

 In para 31, High Court observed- 
 
“But, for the reasons, best known to the 
authority, it still proceeded to award the tender in 
favour of M/s. Vasu Construction Company.” 
 
The High Court therefore to instill confidence in the general public 
and to ensure transparency in the system, constituted an 
independent committee to enquire into the tender process in 
question, and directed the committee to submit its report in a 
sealed cover to the Court. 
02.01.2021 
Committee constituted by High Court filed its report. 
08.01.2021 
High Court disposed of both Petitions being Nos. 3021/2018 and 
363/19 and directed registry to initiate separate proceedings 
against erring officials, observing as under: - 
 
14. Since the committee, after having perused 
the records, has arrived at a definite conclusion 
that on account of shortcomings/irregularities, 
tender in question requires to be cancelled, 
nothing much is left for this court to adjudicate in 
these matters. Leaving everything aside, 
learned counsel for the petitioners in both the 
petitions, being satisfied with the findings of 
enquiry committee as well as suggestions made 
therein, are not willing to prosecute the cases 
further and have prayed to dispose of the same 
as having been rendered infructuous. 
 
15. In view of aforesaid, both the petitions are 
disposed of as infructuous alongwith all pending 
applications. Interim directions, if any, stand 
vacated. However, liberty is reserved to the 
parties to file fresh petition(s), if any, if they still 
remain aggrieved. 
 
16. However, this court, having taken note of the 
fact that the enquiry committee despite having 
found officers lacking in discharge of their 
duties, has failed to fix responsibility and 

recommend action, criminal or departmental, 
deems it necessary to direct the Registry of this 
Court to register separate proceedings, enabling 
this Court to pass appropriate orders so as to 
ensure strict compliance of recommendations 
given in the report of enquiry committee and 
pass appropriate orders with regard to initiation 
of criminal/ departmental proceedings against 
the erring officials. Registry is directed to 
register separate proceedings and list the same 
on 17.3.2021. The order dated 25.9.2020, this 
judgment and the enquiry report submitted by 
the committee constituted by this Court, shall 
form part of the fresh proceedings. 
 
05.02.2021 
Respondent No.1 cancelled the Tender in view of the Order dated 
08.01.2021 passed by the High Court. 
03.03.2021 
Respondent No.2 filed a new Writ Petition against Respondent 
No.1, i.e., CWP 1481 of 2021 challenging order dated 
05.02.2021. 
Respondent no. 2 also filed separate two LPAs being LPA No. 
6/2021 and 12/2021 against the common order dated 08.01.2021 
passed in CWP No. 3021/2018 and CWP No. 363/2019 by the 
Single Bench. 
17.11.2021 
R-1 HIMUDA issued fresh NIT for the same work. 
01.12.2021 
The Division Bench of High Court passed an interim order in LPA 
No. 6/2021, 12/2021 and CWP No. 1481/2021 staying the NIT 
dated 17.11.2021 till further orders. 
 
18.10.2022 
The Division Bench disposed of the 
upon statement of the Executive Engineer of Respondent No.1 
observing as under: 
 
7. Learned counsel for the respondent on 
instructions of Mr. Rajesh Thakur, Executive 
Engineer, HIMUDA, Division, Shimla-9, has 
submitted that the competent authority wants to 
withdraw the cancellation of initial tendering 
process order dated 5th February, 2021, bearing 
No. 5806-11, as the public is deprived from the 

facilities, which would have been available to 
them after completion of the project. The project 
cost is going to be enhanced due to delay in 
execution of the project, which will cause 
additional burden on the public exchequer. The 
various Government departments/PSUs are 
facing acute shortage of office accommodation, 
therefore, in larger public interest, the authority 
has no objection to go ahead with initial 
tendering process, in case the petitioner is ready 
to execute the work at the same rate and terms 
and conditions as were agreed at the time of 
finalization of the initial NIT dated 15.11.2018 
(Annexure P-2). The time period for execution of 
work will start from date of fresh award letter 
which will be issued in favour of the petitioner 
within 15 days. 
 
8.Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner, on 
instructions from the petitioner, has submitted 
that offer made by the respondent is acceptable 
to the petitioner and petitioner is ready to 
execute the project on the same terms and 
conditions and rates as per initial tender dated 
15.11.2018 (Annexure P-2). 
 
Nov. 2022 
Contract Agreement was signed between Respondent 1 & 2. 
Work started. 
12.12.2022 
The Appellant filed the SLP challenging the impugned order 
dated 18.10.2022 and the Court while issuing notice, granted stay 
of operation of the impugned order dated 18.10.2022. 
 
4. The question that has been posed before us in the instant appeal is, 
whether the High Court could have disposed of the CWP filed by the 
respondent no. 2 by simply accepting the statements made on behalf of 
the learned advocates for the respondent no. 1 and respondent no. 2, 

virtually permitting the respondent no.1 HIMUDA to withdraw the 
cancellation of initial tendering process order dated 05.02.2021 and 
permitting the respondent no. 2 M/s Vasu Constructions to execute the 
project on the same terms and conditions and at the rates as per the 
initial tender dated 15.11.2018, though the said tender was already 
withdrawn by the Respondent No.1 HIMUDA in view of the report made 
by the independent Committee constituted by the High Court confirming 
gross irregularities and illegalities committed by the officers of HIMUDA 
and in view of the order dated 08.01.2021 passed by the Single Bench? 
5. As could be seen from the chronology of events, the appellant and the 
respondent No. 2 were declared qualified in the Technical Bids opened 
on 15.12.2018 and on the same day, the financial bid of the said two 
parties were also opened. The respondent no.2 being L-1, the Letter of 
Intent 
dated 
17.12.2018 
was 
issued 
by 
the 
Respondent 
No.1 in favour of the respondent no.2. Subsequently, an unsuccessful 
bidder M/s Dalip Singh Rathore filed a 
in the High Court, alleging irregularities and illegalities in the tender 
process and challenging the eligibility of the respondent no. 2, also 
seeking cancellation of the Tender. The appellant also filed CWP No. 
363/2019 praying for the rejection of the Technical and Financial Bids of 

the respondent no.2. The respondent no.1 HIMUDA in the meantime 
appointed a committee on 01.01.2019 to review the tender process. The 
respondent no.1 also vide the letter dated 02.01.2019 withdrew the 
Letter of Intent issued in favour of the respondent no.2. Subsequently, 
the High Court also appointed an Independent Committee to look into 
the alleged illegalities and irregularities vide the order dated 25.11.2020, 
in order to instill confidence in the general public and to ensure 
transparency in the system. 
6. As transpiring from the order dated 08.01.2021, the said Independent 
Committee submitted the report, arriving at a definite conclusion that the 
officers responsible for evaluation of the tender had not acted 
responsibly and fairly, as a consequence of which both M/s Vasu 
Constructions Company (respondent no.2 herein) and M/s Level 9 Biz 
Pvt. Ltd. (the appellant herein) were wrongly declared eligible in the 
Technical Bid. The Committee had concluded that since both the bidders 
were not technically qualified as per the terms and conditions of the NIT, 
the tender needed to be cancelled. The recommendations made by the 
said Committee, except the recommendation for deletion of condition 
with regard to NPA, were stated to have been accepted by the Enquiry 
Committee of the respondent no. 1 HIMUDA. The High Court recorded 

the statements of the concerned counsels for the parties and disposed 
of the petitions being CWP Nos. 3021/2018 and 363/2019 vide Order 
dated 08.01.2021 observing that the petitions had been rendered 
infructuous, however reserved a liberty for the parties to file fresh 
petition(s), if any, if they still remained aggrieved. 
7. Subsequently, the respondent no.1 HIMUDA cancelled the tender on 
05.02.2021 in view of the said order dated 08.01.2021 passed by the 
High Court. The said action of the respondent no.1 came to be 
challenged by the Respondent No.2 M/s Vasu Constructions by filing a 
petition being CWP No. 1481/2021. The respondent no. 2 also filed two 
LPAs being 6/2021 and 12/2021 being aggrieved by the common Order 
dated 08.01.2021 passed by the Single Bench. The Division Bench of 
the High Court disposed of the CWP No. 1481/2021 vide the impugned 
order dated 18.10.2022 accepting the statements made by the learned 
counsels for the respondent nos. 1 and 2 as stated hereinabove. 
8. We are at loss to understand as to how the said petition filed by the 
respondent no.2 could have been disposed of by the Division Bench by 
merely recording and accepting the statements of the learned counsels 
for the respondent nos. 1 and 2, when the tender in respect of NIT dated 
15.11.2018 was cancelled by the respondent no.1 HIMUDA on account 

of the gross irregularities and illegalities in the tender process found by 
the Independent Committee constituted by the High Court and on 
account of the order passed by the High Court on 08.01.2021? We are 
also at loss to understand as to how the Executive Engineer of HIMUDA, 
could have made the statements before the Division Bench that the 
competent authority of the respondent no.1 wanted to withdraw the 
cancellation of the initial tendering process order dated 05.02.2021 and 
that the respondent no. 1 had no objection to go ahead with the initial 
tendering process, in case the respondent no.2 was ready to execute 
the work on the same terms and conditions as were agreed at the time 
of finalization of NIT dated 15.11.2018, when the respondent no. 1 itself 
had decided to cancel and in fact cancelled the initial tendering process 
vide its order dated 05.02.2021 accepting the findings of the committee 
constituted by the High Court to the effect that there were irregularities 
and illegalities committed by the officers of the HIMUDA in processing 
the tender and that the respondent no. 2 was not technically qualified? 
9. When the common order dated 08.01.2021 was passed in the Writ 
Petition No. 3021 of 2018 filed by the petitioner Dalip Singh and Writ 
Petition No.363 of 2019 filed by the present appellant, recording the said 
findings of the committee appointed by it, pursuant to which order, the 

respondent no.1 had cancelled the tender on 05.02.2021, and had 
issued a fresh NIT on 17.11.2021, it was incumbent on the part of the 
respondent no. 2 to implead the said two petitioners as the party 
respondents in the new petition filed by it i.e. 1481/2021, and it was also 
incumbent on the part of the High Court to give opportunity of hearing 
to the said petitioners before passing the impugned order disposing of 
the said petition merely recording the statements of the learned 
counsels for the respondent nos. 1 and 2, and permitting the respondent 
nos. 1 and 2 to go ahead with execution of the work as per the initial 
tender which was already cancelled by the respondent no.1. 
10. Though it is true that initially an LOI was issued by the respondent no. 
1 in favour of the respondent no. 2 on 17.12.2018, but the same was 
withdrawn by the respondent no. 1 as per the letter dated 02.01.2019 
on account of pending litigations in the High Court. In any case, it hardly 
needs to be reiterated that the Letter of Intent is merely an expression 
of intention to enter into a contract. It does not create any right in favour 
of the party to whom it is issued. There is no binding legal relationship 
between the party issuing the LOI and the party to whom such LOI is 
issued. A detailed agreement/contract is required to be drawn up 

between the parties after the LOI is received by the other party more 
particularly in case of contract of such a mega scale. 
11. Since, there was no right whatsoever created in favour of the 
respondent no. 2, and since the respondent no. 1 HIMUDA had already 
accepted the recommendations of the Committee appointed by the High 
Court and the order dated 08.01.2021 passed by the High Court, and 
had cancelled the tender and issued fresh NIT on 17.11.2021, the 
respondent no. 1 could not have agreed to allow the respondent no. 2, 
who was found to be not technically qualified, to go ahead with the 
execution of the project in question and that too without giving the other 
two parties any opportunity to negotiate. If the respondent no. 1 was so 
keen to provide the facilities to the public without causing any additional 
burden on the public exchequer, all the three parties who had 
participated in the original tender should have been given the 
opportunity to negotiate with it. 
12. Having regard to the entire chain of events, and the conduct of the 
respondent nos. 1 and 2, we have no hesitation in holding that the 
respondent no. 1 in collusion with the respondent no. 2, had taken the 
High Court for a ride and misused the process of law for covering up the 
irregularities and illegalities committed in the tender process by the 

officers of the respondent no. 1, and for anyhow awarding the contract 
to the respondent no. 2 under the guise of the court’s order. It is a matter 
of surprise for us that the High Court also could not notice the ill-intention 
of the respondent nos. 1 and 2 and disposed of the petition, permitting 
them to go ahead with the original tender, ignoring the reports of the 
independent committee and the observations made by the Single Bench 
in the Order dated 08.01.2021 with regard to the irregularities and 
illegalities committed by the officers of the respondent no. 1 HIMUDA. 
13. The impugned order having been passed without proper application of 
mind and without assigning any cogent reason for brushing aside the 
findings recorded by the Independent Committee and the observations 
made by the Single Bench in the order dated 08.01.2021, the same 
deserves to be quashed and set aside. Since, we have found that the 
respondent no.1 HIMUDA, though ‘State’ within the meaning of Article 
12 of the Constitution of India, had acted malafide and in collusion with 
the respondent no.2, and had taken the High Court for a ride, the present 
appeal deserves to be allowed with heavy cost. 
14. In that view of the matter, the impugned order passed by the High Court 
is set aside. The appeal is allowed with cost of Rs. 5,00,000/- to be 
deposited by the respondent no. 1 HIMUDA with the Supreme Court 

Advocates-on-Record Association, within two weeks from today. 
However, it is clarified that the respondent no.1 shall be at liberty to 
initiate a fresh tender process in accordance with law and after following 
the due process of law.
