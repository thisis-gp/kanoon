 RESPONDENT(S) 

JUDGMENT 
 
UJJAL BHUYAN, J. 

Appellants i.e., Union of India, Director General of Foreign 
Trade and Joint Director General of Foreign Trade by means of this civil 
appeal have taken exception to the judgment and order dated 
22.08.2008 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka, 
Circuit Bench at Dharwad in affirming the 
judgment and order of the learned Single Judge dated 22.09.2005 
allowing filed by the respondent. 

2. 
 
Facts lie within a narrow compass. Nonetheless, for a 
determination of the lis, it would be necessary to briefly narrate the 
relevant facts as projected by the respondent in the related writ petition. 
2.1. 
 Respondent is a class-I contractor specializing in the field 
of civil contract works especially funneling and hydro electric power 
projects. 
2.2. 
Central Government had approved funding of a project 
called Koyna Hydro Electric Power Project, Maharashtra by the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is an 
arm of the World Bank. In the said project, respondent was awarded a 
sub-contract to execute civil works from Lake Intake to the Emergency 
Valve Tunnel. Respondent has relied upon a letter dated 08.08.1991 
issued by the Chief Engineer of the project. Relevant portion of the letter 
reads thus:- 
 4.2. 
Information regarding the benefits available 
under the “Deemed Export” concept for this World Bank 
Aided (Loan) Project may please be obtained by the 
contractors from their own sources and the information 
gained by them may be utilised, while quoting the rates. 
 
2.3. 
A deemed export scheme was announced under the 
Exim Policy, 1992-1997 by the Ministry of Commerce, Government 
of India and the Director General of Foreign Trade under the 
Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992. Certain 

benefits under ‘deemed export’ were also included in the said Exim 
Policy. 
2.4. 
Respondent completed the construction work awarded 
to it in the month of March, 1996 and thereafter filed applications 
dated 25.03.1996, 13.09.1996 and 20.12.1996 claiming duty 
drawback 
for 
Rs.35,75,679.00, 
Rs.88,98,206.00 
and 
Rs.85,05,853.00 respectively. 
2.5. 
By endorsements dated 10.11.1996, 06.12.1996 and 
31.12.1996, Director General of Foreign Trade (for short ‘DGFT’ 
hereinafter) rejected the applications of the respondent for duty 
drawback on the ground that supplies in civil construction work 
were not eligible for ‘deemed export’ benefit. 
2.6. 
Notwithstanding such rejection, respondent made 
representations for reconsideration of such decision and sought for 
duty drawback under the Exim Policy, 1992-1997. One such 
representation is dated 05.02.1997. However, the same was 
rejected by the DGFT vide the order dated 10.08.1997 stating that 
civil construction work did not qualify for drawback. 
2.7. 
On 20.08.1998, DGFT issued a circular under the 
successor Exim Policy, 1997-2002 clarifying that supply of goods 
under paragraph 10(2)(d) of the 1997-2002 Exim Policy would be 

entitled for ‘deemed export’ benefit. It may be mentioned that the 
Exim Policy of 1992-1997 had expired with effect from 31.03.1997. 
2.8. 
On 05.12.2000, DGFT issued a circular that drawback 
was to be paid in respect of excise duty on supply of goods to 
projects funded by multilateral agencies. 
2.9. 
In the above scenario, respondent once again addressed 
a letter dated 28.08.2001 to the DGFT to finalize the issue. 
However, DGFT rejected the claim vide the communication dated 
21.06.2002. 
2.10. 
Notwithstanding the same, a Policy Interpretation 
Committee was constituted which examined the case of the 
respondent in its meeting held on 07.10.2002. It was decided that 
the benefit of duty drawback under the ‘deemed export’ scheme 
would be extended to the respondent. Consequently, in 
supersession of the earlier rejection order dated 21.06.2002 and in 
the light of the decision of the Policy Interpretation Committee 
dated 07.10.2002, DGFT vide the order dated 01.11.2002 
permitted duty drawback of Rs.2,05,79,740.00 to the respondent. 
Thereafter 
cheques 
for 
Rs.25,00,000.00, 
Rs.63,23,575.00, 
Rs.81,05,583.00 and Rs.56,50,312.00, totalling Rs.2,25,79,470.00 
vide endorsements dated 31.03.2003 and 20.05.2003 were issued. 

However, it was clarified that duty drawback granted to the 
respondent would not be treated as a precedent. 
2.11. 
Respondent 
thereafter 
submitted 
representation 
addressed to the appellants dated 06.06.2003, 14.06.2003, 
17.07.2003, 29.10.2003 and 10.08.2004 seeking interest on the 
duty drawback amount paid on the ground of delayed payment. 
However, the request for interest made by the respondent was 
rejected by the DGFT. 
3. 
 
Aggrieved by rejection of the request for interest on the 
amount of duty drawback paid, respondent preferred a writ petition 
before the High Court which was registered as Writ Petition 
No.45525 of 2004. After hearing the parties, a learned Single Judge 
of the High Court vide the judgment and order dated 22.09.2005 
referred to the notification dated 05.12.2000 and held that 
respondent was entitled for duty drawback. After observing that 
there was delay in payment of duty drawback, learned Single Judge 
held that respondent would be entitled to interest for delayed 
payment of duty drawback. Since Customs Act, 1962 provides that 
interest has to be paid in such a case in the range of five percent 
to thirty percent, learned Single Judge awarded interest at the rate 
of fifteen percent. Consequently, directions were issued to the 

appellants to consider the claim of the respondent for payment of 
interest on delayed refund from the date of notification dated 
05.12.2000 till the date of payment to the respondent within a 
period of three months. 
4. 
 
This judgment and order of the learned Single Judge 
came to be assailed by the appellants before the Division Bench of 
the High Court which was registered as Writ Appeal No.356 of 
2006. Respondent also filed assailing 
the direction of the learned Single Judge to pay interest only from 
05.12.2000. The Division Bench took note of the fact that since 
duty drawback was refunded by the appellants to the respondent, 
the only question to be considered was the entitlement of the 
respondent to interest for the delayed refund. In this connection, 
the Division Bench examined the notification dated 20.08.1998 
and observed that this notification had clarified that ‘deemed 
export’ would include goods and services of civil construction 
projects. Thus, duty drawback under the Exim Policy in force was 
extended even to civil construction. This position was further 
clarified by the subsequent notification dated 05.12.2000. Such 
notification was held by the Division Bench to be clarificatory in 
nature, thus having retrospective effect. After referring to Sections 

27A and 75A of the Customs Act, 1962, the Division Bench held 
that respondent would be entitled to interest after expiry of three 
months from the date of making the applications for refund of duty 
drawback. Vide the judgment and order dated 22.08.2008, the 
Division Bench opined that respondent would be entitled to 
interest from the date of expiry of three months after submitting 
the applications for refund of duty drawback in the year 1996 at 
the rate of fifteen percent as awarded by the learned Single Judge. 
While the writ appeal of the respondent was allowed, the writ 
appeal of the appellants was dismissed. 
5. 
 
Mr. V. C. Bharathi, learned counsel for the appellants 
submitted a short list of dates and events. He pointed out 
therefrom that applications filed by the respondent for duty 
drawback were repeatedly rejected by the DGFT. Notwithstanding 
such rejection, respondent continued to file one representation 
after the other claiming duty drawback. It is in such 
circumstances that a Policy Interpretation Committee was 
constituted by the DGFT which examined the case of the 
respondent and vide its decision dated 07.10.2002 decided to 
extend the benefit of duty drawback to the respondent as a special 
case. It is in this backdrop that DGFT had passed order dated 

01.11.2002 emphasizing that the duty drawback paid to the 
respondent would not be treated as a precedent. He submitted that 
duty drawback was extended to the respondent as a special case 
which was not available to the respondent under the Exim Policy 
of 1992-1997. In such circumstances, question of awarding any 
interest to the respondent on the ground of alleged delay in 
payment of duty drawback did not arise. There was no provision 
under the Exim Policy of 1992-1997 for payment of such interest. 
Therefore, learned Single Judge erred in awarding interest to the 
respondent, that too, at the high rate of fifteen percent. 
5.1. 
He further argued that the Division Bench had fallen in 
error taking the view that circulars dated 20.08.1998 and 
05.12.2000 were clarificatory in nature and therefore would have 
retrospective effect covering the case of the respondent. According 
to him, these circulars were issued under the successor Exim 
Policy, 1997-2002 and thus could not be applied to cases like that 
of the respondent under the Exim Policy 1992-1997. He, therefore, 
submitted that the present is a fit case for interfering with the 
decision of the learned Single Judge as affirmed by the Division 
Bench. 

6. 
 
Per-contra, Mr. Basuva Prabhu Patil, learned senior 
counsel for the respondent supported the orders of the learned 
Single Judge and that of the Division Bench. He submitted that the 
appellants having granted the benefit of duty drawback to the 
respondent though belatedly, it is not open to them to now contend 
that respondent was not entitled to such duty drawback which was 
only granted as a concession. Admittedly, there was delay in refund 
of duty drawback. Respondent is, therefore, entitled to interest on 
such delayed refund which was rightly awarded by the High Court. 
6.1. 
 Referring to the provisions of Section 27A of the 
Customs Act, 1962 (referred to as the ‘Customs Act’ hereinafter), 
learned senior counsel submitted that the High Court had taken a 
rather conservative figure considering the legislative scheme while 
awarding interest at the rate of fifteen percent to the respondent. 
He, therefore, submitted that no interference would be called for in 
the orders of the High Court and that the civil appeal filed by the 
appellants should be dismissed. 
7. 
 
Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties 
have received the due consideration of the Court. 

8. 
 
Before we examine the decisions of the High Court, it 
would be apposite to briefly highlight the statutory framework and 
the concerned Exim Policy. 
9. 
 
Section 11A of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (briefly 
‘Central Excise Act’ hereinafter) deals with recovery of duties not 
levied or not paid or short-levied or short paid or erroneously 
refunded. Relevant for our purpose is sub-section (1) which says 
that where any duty of excise has not been levied or not paid or 
has been short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded, for 
any reason other than the reason of fraud or collusion etc. with 
intent to evade payment of duty, the Central Excise Officer shall 
serve notice on the person so chargeable within two years from the 
relevant date requiring him to show cause why he should not pay 
the amount specified in the notice. The person chargeable with 
duty may either before service of notice pay on the basis of his own 
ascertainment or the duty ascertained by the Central Excise 
Officer, the amount of duty along with interest payable thereon 
under Section 11AA. In the event of fraud, collusion etc. the notice 
period gets extended to five years. 
9.1 
Duty is cast upon the person liable to pay duty either 
voluntarily or after determination under Section 11A to pay interest 

in addition to the duty under sub-section (1) of Section 11AA. As 
per sub-section (2), such interest shall not be below ten percent 
and shall not exceed thirty six percent per annum, as the Central 
Government may by notification in the Official Gazette fix. Such 
interest shall be calculated from the date on which the duty 
becomes due up to the date of actual payment of the amount due. 
9.2. 
Section 11B of the Central Excise Act entitles any person 
claiming refund of any duty of excise and interest to make an 
application for refund of such duty and interest before the expiry 
of one year from the relevant date (prior to 12.05.2000, it was six 
months instead of one year). 
9.3. 
Section 11BB provides for interest on delayed refund. It 
says that if any duty ordered to be refunded under sub-section (2) 
of Section 11B to any applicant is not refunded within three 
months from the date of receipt of the application under sub-
section (1) of that section, there shall be paid to such applicant 
interest at such rate not below five percent and not exceeding thirty 
percent per annum as for the time being fixed by the Central 
Government, by notification in the Official Gazette. Prior to 
11.05.2001, the rate of interest was not below ten percent. The 
applicant would be entitled to interest after expiry of three months 

from the date of receipt of such application till the date of refund 
of such duty. 
10. 
Section 27 of the Customs Act deals with claim for 
refund of duty. As per sub-section (1), any person claiming refund 
of any duty or interest paid by him or borne by him, may make an 
application in the prescribed form and manner, for such refund 
addressed to the designated authority before the expiry of one year 
from the date of payment of such duty or interest. Explanation 
below sub-section (1) clarifies that for the purpose of sub-section 
(1), the date of payment of duty or interest in relation to a person, 
other than an importer, shall be construed as the date of purchase 
of goods by such person. 
10.1. 
Sub-section (2) says that if on the receipt of such 
application the designated authority is satisfied that the whole or 
any part of the duty and interest, if any, paid on such duty, paid 
by the applicant is refundable, he may make an order accordingly 
and the amount so determined shall be credited to the Consumer 
Welfare Fund established under Section 12C of the Central Excise 
Act. However, as per the proviso, the amount of duty and interest 
so determined shall be paid to the applicant instead of being 
credited to the Consumer Welfare Fund if such amount is relatable, 

amongst others, to drawback of duty payable under Sections 74 
and 75 of the Customs Act. 
11. 
Section 27A of the Customs Act provides for interest on 
delayed refund. It says that, if any duty ordered to be refunded 
under sub-section (2) of Section 27 to an applicant is not refunded 
within three months from the date of receipt of the application, 
there shall be paid to that applicant interest at such rate not below 
five percent and not exceeding thirty percent per annum as is for 
the time being fixed by the Central Government, by notification in 
the Official Gazette, on such duty from the date immediately after 
the expiry of three months from the date of receipt of such 
application till the date of refund of such duty. 
12. 
Chapter X of the Customs Act comprising of Sections 74 
to 76 deals with drawback. While Section 74 allows drawback on 
re-export of duty-paid goods, Section 75 provides for drawback on 
imported materials used in the manufacture of goods which are 
exported. On the other hand, Section 75A deals with interest on 
drawback. Sub-section (1) of Section 75A says that, where any 
drawback payable to a claimant under Section 74 or Section 75 is 
not paid within a period of one month (earlier it was two months 
and prior thereto it was three months) from the date of filing a claim 

for payment of such drawback, there shall be paid to that claimant 
in addition to the amount of drawback, interest at the rate fixed 
under Section 27A from the date after the expiry of the said period 
of one month till the date of payment of such drawback. 
13. 
In exercise of the powers conferred under Section 3 of 
the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947, the Central 
Government notified the Export and Import (Exim) Policy for the 
period 1992-1997. It came into effect from 01.04.1992 and 
remained in force for a period of five years up to 31.03.1997. 
14. 
After the enactment of The Foreign Trade (Development 
and Regulation) Act, 1992, the Exim Policy, 1992-1997 was 
deemed to have been made under the aforesaid Act. That being the 
position, we will briefly refer to the said enactment. 
15. 
The Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 
1992 (briefly ‘the 1992 Act’ hereinafter) is an act to provide for the 
development and regulation of foreign trade by facilitating imports 
into and augmenting exports from India and for matters connected 
therewith or incidental thereto. 
15.1. 
Section 4 declares that all orders made under the 
Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947 and in force immediately 
before the commencement of the 1992 Act shall so far as they are 

not inconsistent with the provisions of the 1992 Act would continue 
to be in force and shall be deemed to have been made under the 
1992 Act. 
15.2. 
Thus, by virtue of Section 4 of the 1992 Act, the Exim 
Policy of 1992-1997 continued to be in force and was deemed to 
have been made under the 1992 Act. 
16. 
Section 5 of the 1992 Act, as it stood at the relevant 
point of time, dealt with export and import policy. As per Section 
5, the Central Government may from time to time formulate and 
anounce by notification in the Official Gazette, the export and 
import policy and may also, in the like manner, amend that policy. 
17. 
Rule 2(e) of the Foreign Trade (Regulation) Rules, 1993, 
framed under the 1992 Act, defines the word ‘policy’ to mean export 
and import policy formulated and announced by the Central 
Government under Section 5. 
 
18. 
Let us now revert back to the Exim Policy, 1992 – 1997. 
Section 7 of the said policy ascribes meaning to the words and 
expressions for the purpose of the policy. As per Section 7(13), 
‘drawback’ in relation to any goods manufactured in India and 
exported means the rebate of duty chargeable on any imported 

materials or excisable materials used in the manufacture of such 
goods in India. 
19. 
Chapter VII of the policy provides for ‘Duty Exemption 
Scheme’. Section 47, which is the first section in Chapter VII, 
mentions that under the Duty Exemption Scheme, imports of duty 
free raw materials, components, intermediates, consumables, 
parts, spares including mandatory spares and packing materials 
required for the purpose of export production may be permitted by 
the competent authority under the five categories of licences 
mentioned in the said chapter, including special imprest licence. 
As per Section 56 (ii)(3), supplies made to projects financed by 
multilateral or bilateral agencies like the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development would be entitled to duty free 
import of raw materials, components, intermediates, consumables, 
parts, spares including mandatory spares and packing materials 
to main/sub-contractors for the manufacture and supply of 
products to such projects. 
20. 
Chapter X introduced the concept of ‘deemed exports’. 
Section 120 defines ‘deemed exports’ to mean those transactions 
in which the goods supplied did not leave the country and the 
payment for the goods was received by the supplier in Indian 

rupees but the supplies earned or saved foreign exchange for the 
country. 
21. 
Under Section 121 (f), supply of goods to projects 
financed by multilateral or bilateral agencies, such as, the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development under 
international competitive bidding or under limited tender system 
would be regarded as ‘deemed exports’ under the Exim Policy of 
1992-1997. 
22. 
Section 122 provides that ‘deemed exports’ shall be 
eligible for the benefits in respect of manufacture and supply of 
goods qualifying as ‘deemed exports’, including under the Duty 
Drawback Scheme. 
23. 
In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 75 of the 
Customs Act, Section 37 of the Central Excise Act and Section 93A 
read with Section 94 of the Finance Act, 1994, the Central 
Government has made a set of rules called the Customs, Central 
Excise Duties and Service Tax Drawback Rules, 1995. Rule 2(a) 
defines ‘drawback’ in relation to any goods manufactured in India 
and exported, to mean the rebate of duty or tax as the case may 
be, chargeable on any imported materials or excisable materials 
used or taxable services used as input services in the manufacture 

of such goods. ‘Excisable material’ has been defined under Rule 
2(b) to mean any material produced or manufactured in India 
subject to a duty of excise under the Central Excise Act. Likewise, 
the expression ‘imported material’ has been defined under Rule 
2(d) to mean any material imported into India and on which duty 
is chargeable under the Customs Act. 
23.1. 
Rule 3 provides for allowance of drawback. Sub-rule (1) 
says that subject to the provisions of the Customs Act, Central 
Excise Act, the Finance Act, 1994 and the rules made under the 
aforesaid three enactments, a drawback may be allowed on the 
export of goods at such amount or at such rates as may be 
determined by the Central Government. 
23.2. 
 
Rule 14 deals with payment of drawback and 
interest. Sub-rule (1) says that the drawback under the Customs, 
Central Excise Duties and Service Tax Drawback Rules, 1995 
(briefly ‘the 1995 Rules’ hereinafter) and interest, if any, shall be 
paid by the proper officer of customs to the exporter or to the agent 
specially authorized by the exporter to receive the said amount of 
drawback and interest. Sub-rule (2) clarifies that the officer of 
customs may combine one or more claims for the purpose of 
payment of drawback and interest, if any, as well as adjustment of 

any amount of drawback and interest already paid and may issue 
a consolidated order for payment. As per sub-rule (3), the date of 
payment of drawback and interest, if any, shall be deemed to be, 
in the case of payment by cheque, the date of issue of such cheque; 
or by credit in the exporter’s account maintained with the Custom 
House, the date of such credit. 
24. 
At this stage, we may mention that in exercise of the 
powers conferred by Section 27A of the Customs Act, the Central 
Board of Excise and Customs had issued notification bearing 
No.32/1995 (NT)-Customs dated 26.05.1995 fixing the rate of 
interest at fifteen percent for the purposes of Section 27A of the 
Customs Act. This was notified by the Central Government in the 
Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue in the Official Gazette 
of India dated 26.05.1995. 
25. 
Likewise, in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 
11BB of the Central Excise Act, the Central Board of Excise and 
Customs issued notification No.22/95-Central Excises (NT) dated 
29.05.1995 fixing the rate of interest at fifteen percent per annum 
for the purposes of the said section. This was also notified by the 
Central Government in the Official Gazette of India on 29.05.1995. 

26. 
Though it may not be necessary, still we may refer to the 
circulars dated 20.08.1998 and 05.12.2000 issued by the DGFT. 
Circular dated 20.08.1998 says that representations had been 
received from individual exporters as well as clarifications sought 
for by different regional licencing authorities with regard to 
availability of deemed export benefit for supply of goods and 
services to civil construction projects. Circular dated 20.08.1998 
says that the issue as to whether supply of goods and services to 
civil construction projects would be entitled for deemed export 
benefit or not had been examined in detail, whereafter it was 
clarified that supply of goods under paragraph 10(2)(d) of the Exim 
Policy would be entitled to deemed export benefit. Therefore, if 
within the scope of a work of turn-key civil construction project, 
supply of goods is included then supply of such goods would be 
entitled to deemed export benefit. 
26.1. 
It appears that representations were continued to be 
received by the DGFT regarding admissibility of duty drawback on 
supplies made to turn-key projects, considered as deemed export 
in terms of the Exim Policy. Circular dated 05.12.2000 mentions 
that the matter was deliberated upon by the Policy Review 
Committee. It was noted that it was not possible for a single 

contractor to manufacture himself all the items required for 
execution of such projects. Hence certain items, either imported or 
indigenous, had necessarily to be procured from other sources. It 
was, therefore, clarified that all such directly supplied items, 
whether imported or indigenous, and used in the projects, the 
condition ‘manufactured in India’, a pre-requisite for grant of 
deemed export benefit, was satisfied in view of the fact that such 
activities being undertaken at the project site constituted 
‘manufacture’ as per the definition provided in the Exim Policy. 
Accordingly, it was clarified that the duties, customs and central 
excise, suffered on such goods should be refunded through the 
duty drawback route. Referring to the previous circular dated 
20.08.1998, it was further clarified that excise duty paid on supply 
of inputs, such as, cement, steel etc., would be refunded through 
the duty drawback route in the same manner as in any other case 
of excisable goods being supplied to any other project qualifying for 
deemed export benefit, subject to the project authority certifying 
the receipt and use of such inputs in the project. 
27. 
As already noted above, a Policy Interpretation 
Committee was constituted. The said committee held a meeting on 
07.10.2002, chaired by the DGFT. One of the agenda items 

deliberated upon in the said meeting was the claim of the 
respondent regarding inclusion of excise duty component in the 
price quoted before the project authority as a case of deemed export 
and refund of the same through the duty drawback route. The 
Policy Interpretation Committee discussed the case of the 
respondent and opined that in case any such firms were still 
competitive and able to supply goods at international prices despite 
including the component of excise duty in the price quoted before 
the project authority, the deemed export benefit could not be 
denied to such firms. Hence, the committee decided to permit 
deemed export benefit even in cases where the excise duty 
component was factored in the pricing quoted provided other 
conditions of deemed export benefit were adhered to. 
27.1. 
From a perusal of the minutes of the meeting of the 
Policy Interpretation Committee held on 07.10.2002, it is evident 
that the committee had opined to extend the deemed export benefit 
to those firms which included excise duty component in the tender 
pricing quoted before the project authority such as the respondent. 
There is nothing in the minutes to indicate that such benefit was 
being extended to the respondent as a one off case or by way of 
concession. 

28. 
Based on the minutes of the Policy Interpretation 
Committee meeting held on 07.10.2002, DGFT issued letter dated 
01.11.2002, a copy of which was marked to the respondent, 
superseding the previous rejection order dated 21.06.2002 and 
allowing duty drawback to be paid to the respondent for 
materials/goods, such as, steel, cement etc., used in the civil works 
of Koyna Hydro Electric Project. The amount of drawback 
refundable to the respondent was quantified at Rs.2,05,79,740.00. 
In the said letter, it was, however, mentioned that grant of 
drawback should not be treated as a precedent. It was thereafter 
that cheques were issued paying the aforesaid amount of duty 
drawback to the respondent. At that stage, respondent submitted 
representations contending that there was delay in the refund of 
drawback and therefore, it was entitled to interest from the relevant 
date at the rate of fifteen percent in terms of the notification 
No.22/95 dated 29.05.1995 (we may mention that the respondent 
had placed reliance on the aforesaid notification which fixed 
interest at the rate of fifteen percent for delayed refund of duty 
under Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act). However, such 
representations were rejected by the DGFT on 10.07.2003 and 
06.08.2003 respectfully. In the rejection letter dated 10.07.2003, 
respondent was informed by the office of DGFT that there was no 

provision for payment of interest on the deemed export duty 
drawback. Therefore, the request for payment of interest could not 
be agreed upon. 
29. 
Learned Single Judge referred to the circular dated 
05.12.2000 and observed that pursuant thereto appellants had 
paid the duty drawback to the respondent. However, there was 
delay in payment of duty drawback at least from the date of the 
clarificatory circular dated 05.12.2000. Therefore, respondent 
would be entitled to interest from the date of the clarification till 
the date of payment. After observing that the Customs Act provides 
for interest on delayed refund within the range from five percent to 
thirty percent, learned Single Judge directed the appellants to pay 
interest on the delayed refund from the date of the clarificatory 
circular dated 05.12.2000 till the date of payment within a period 
of three months. 
30. 
Appellants filed assailing 
the aforesaid decision of the learned Single Judge. On the other 
hand, respondent also filed a writ appeal being Writ Appeal 
No.3699 of 2005 assailing the directions of the learned Single 
Judge to pay interest only from the date of the circular dated 
05.12.2000. 

30.1 
Before the Division Bench, it was contended on behalf of 
the appellants that it was only under the Foreign Trade Policy, 
2004-2009 that for the first time payment of simple interest at the 
rate of six percent per annum in the event of delay in refund of duty 
drawback was provided. There was no provision for payment of 
interest on delayed refund of duty drawback on deemed export 
prior thereto. Therefore, respondent was not entitled to interest 
even from 05.12.2000 as directed by the learned Single Judge. It 
was canvassed before the Division Bench on behalf of the 
appellants that only due to magnanimity on the part of the Central 
Government refund of duty drawback under deemed export was 
paid to the respondent. As such, refund would not carry any 
interest. 
30.2 
The Division Bench repelled such contentions advanced 
on behalf of the appellants and held that in view of the circular 
dated 05.12.2000, it was clarified that even civil construction 
works were entitled to the benefit of deemed export under the Exim 
Policy. After saying so, the Division Bench noted that as a matter 
of fact, an amount of Rs.2,05,79,740.00 was paid to the respondent 
as duty drawback. Thereafter, the Division Bench analysed the 
circular dated 05.12.2000 and upon such analysis it was observed 

that the position vis-à-vis refund of duty drawback in civil 
construction work treating it as deemed export was clarified in an 
earlier circular dated 20.08.1998. Thus, according to the Division 
Bench, by the year 1998 itself, DGFT had clarified that civil 
construction work was entitled to the benefit of duty drawback as 
deemed export. Having held so, the Division Bench posed a 
question as to whether the respondent would be entitled to interest 
after expiry of three months from the date of the applications for 
refund of duty drawback? Corollary to the above question was an 
ancillary question as to whether a clarificatory or declaratory 
notification or circular would have retrospective operation? After 
referring to decisions of this Court reported in 1993 Supplementary 
(3) SCC 234 S. S. Grewal versus State of Punjab, (1995) 
Rajagopal Reddy (dead) by Lrs. Vs. Padmini Chandrasekharan 
(dead) by Lrs., and (2004) Zile Singh versus State of 
Haryana, the Division Bench opined that the minute the Exim 
Policy came into force the benefit of duty drawback automatically 
became available to the respondent and that the clarification was 
only with regard to the doubts expressed in some quarters as to 
whether civil construction works were also entitled to such benefit. 
By virtue of the two circulars dated 20.08.1998 and 05.12.2000, 
no new right or benefit came to be created; those two circulars were 

clarificatory in nature only clarifying that the benefit under the 
Exim Policy 1992-1997 was available to civil construction as well. 
Therefore, such benefit would take effect from the date of the Exim 
Policy. It was thereafter that the Division Bench posed the further 
question as to what would be the rate of interest on the delayed 
refund. In this connection, the Division Bench referred to Sections 
27A and 75A of the Customs Act and came to the conclusion that 
the date of payment of interest would have to be on expiry of the 
period of three months from the date of making an application for 
refund of duty drawback. The Division Bench held that the 
respondent would be entitled to interest from the date of expiry of 
three months after submission of applications for refund back in 
the year 1996 till the time the payment was made at the rate of 
fifteen percent as awarded by the learned Single Judge. 
Consequently, the appeal of the appellants was dismissed while the 
appeal of the respondent was allowed. 
31. 
Reverting back to the Exim Policy of 1992-1997, we 
have already noted about the Duty Exemption Scheme. We have 
noted that under the Duty Exemption Scheme, import of duty free 
raw materials, components, intermediates, consumables, parts, 
spares including mandatory spares and packing materials 

required for the purpose of export production could be permitted 
by the competent authority under five categories of licences 
mentioned in Chapter VII including special imprest licence. 
Section 56 provided that a special imprest licence was granted for 
the duty free import of raw materials, components, consumables, 
parts, spares including mandatory spares and packing materials 
to main/sub-contractors for the manufacture or supply of 
products when such supply were made to projects financed by 
multilateral or bilateral agencies, such as, the International Bank 
for 
Reconstruction 
and 
Development 
under 
international 
competitive bidding or under limited tender system. 
31.1 
In Chapter X ‘deemed export’ has been defined. It is a 
transaction in which the goods supplied do not leave the country 
and the payment for the goods is received by the supplier in Indian 
rupees, but the supplies earn or save foreign exchange for the 
country. Section 121 declares that the categories of supply of 
goods mentioned in the said section would be regarded as ‘deemed 
export’ under the Exim Policy provided the goods were 
manufactured in India and the payment was received in Indian 
rupees. This included supply of goods to projects financed by 
multilateral or bilateral agencies or any other agency that may be 

notified by the Central Government, such as, the International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development under international 
competitive bidding or under limited tender system in accordance 
with the procedures of those agencies. 
31.2 
Section 122 clarifies that deemed export would be 
eligible for benefits under the Duty Drawback Scheme in respect 
of manufacture and supply of goods by treating those as deemed 
export. 
32. 
That apart, as already mentioned in the earlier part of 
the judgement, the Explanation below sub-section (1) of Section 
27 of the Customs Act clarifies that the expression ‘the date of 
payment of duty or interest’ in relation to a person other than an 
importer shall be construed as ‘the date of purchase of goods’ by 
such person. 
33. 
Therefore, on a conjoint and careful reading of the 
relevant provisions of the Exim Policy, 1992-1997 in conjunction 
with the Central Excise Act and the Customs Act, it is evident that 
supply of goods to the project in question by the respondent was a 
case of ‘deemed export’ and thus entitled to the benefit under the 
Duty Drawback Scheme. The language employed in the policy 

made this very clear and there was no ambiguity in respect of such 
entitlement. 
34. 
Even if there was any doubt, the same was fully 
explained by the 1995 Rules. In fact, under the definition clause 
of the 1995 Rules, duty drawback, in relation to any goods 
manufactured in India and exported has been defined to mean the 
rebate of duty or tax chargeable on any imported materials or 
excisable materials used or taxable services used in the 
manufacture of such goods. In the preceding paragraphs, we have 
noted the meaning of the expressions ‘excisable materials’ and 
‘manufacture’. 
34.1 
Rule 3 of the 1995 Rules makes it abundantly clear that 
a drawback may be allowed on the export of goods at such amount 
or at such rates as may be determined by the Central Government. 
Further, Rule 14 provides for payment of drawback and interest. 
35. 
It was, therefore, not correct on the part of the 
appellants to contend that there was no provision for payment of 
interest on delayed refund of duty drawback. That apart, it is 
wholly untenable for the appellants to contend that refund of duty 
drawback was granted to the respondent as a concession, not to 
be treated as a precedent. As we have seen, respondent is entitled 

to refund of duty drawback as a deemed export under the Duty 
Drawback Scheme. The applications for refund were made in 1996. 
Decision to grant refund of duty drawback was taken belatedly on 
07.10.2002 whereafter the payments were made by way of cheques 
on 
31.03.2003 
and 
20.05.2003. 
Admittedly, 
there 
was 
considerable delay in refund of duty drawback. 
36. 
As we have already examined, under sub-section (1) of 
Section 75A of the Customs Act, where duty drawback is not paid 
within a period of three months from the date of filing of claim, the 
claimant would be entitled to interest in addition to the amount of 
drawback. This section provides that the interest would be at the 
rate fixed under Section 27A from the date after expiry of the said 
period of three months till the payment of such drawback. If we 
look at Section 27A, the interest rate prescribed thereunder at the 
relevant point of time was not below ten percent and not exceeding 
thirty percent per annum. 
37. 
The Central Board of Excise and Customs vide its 
notification bearing No.32/1995 (NT) – Customs dated 26.5.1995 
had fixed the rate of interest at fifteen percent for the purpose of 
Section 27A of the Customs Act. The High Court while awarding 
interest at the rate of fifteen percent per annum, however, did not 

refer to such notification; rather, there was no discussion at all as 
to why the rate of interest on the delayed refund should be fifteen 
percent. Therefore, at the first glance, the rate of interest awarded 
by the High Court appeared to be on the higher side and without 
any reason. 
38. 
Be that as it may, having regard to our discussions 
made above, we have no hesitation in holding that the respondent 
was entitled to refund of duty drawback. Appellants had belatedly 
accepted the said claim and made the refund. Since there was 
belated refund of the duty drawback to the respondent, it was 
entitled to interest at the rate which was fixed by the Central 
Government at the relevant point of time being fifteen percent. 
39. 
That being the position, we find no good reason to 
interfere with the judgment and order of the Division Bench of the 
High Court dated 22.8.2008. There is no merit in the appeal, which 
is accordingly dismissed. No costs..………………………………J.
