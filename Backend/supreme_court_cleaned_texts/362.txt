1 High Court of Judicature at Madras, Bench at Madurai 
2 II Additional District Judge for CBI Cases, Madurai 

4. 
 
The proceedings arise out of common FIR No. RC MA1 2004 
A 0061 dated 27.09.2004 registered by Central Bureau of Investigation 
(C.B.I.) under Section 120-B, read with Sections 420, 477(A) of IPC and 
Section 13(2), read with Section 13(1)(d) of Prevention of Corruption 
Act,1988 at Chennai. It is a case in which fraudulent transactions were 
made by the accused in connivance with the officers working at that 
time in Indian Bank at Srirangam Branch, Trichy. 
5. 
 
The petitioner in SLP(Crl.) No.3787 of 2024 is proprietor of 
M/s Kumaran Silks whereas the petitioner in SLP(Crl.) No.3788 of 2024 
is the partner in M/s Sri Ganesh Godown. In the FIR, there are total 14 
accused out of which 4 are bank officials and 10 are private 
businessmen. 
6. 
 
The allegations against the accused were that the bank 
officers had made certain unauthorised debits in external clearing 
account and local drafts accounts and the said amount were credited to 
different parties accounts to offset the unauthorised temporary 
Demand Overdraft allowed earlier. The transactions were done in 
September 2002. The result was interest free advance to the 
petitioners. Inspection was carried out by the senior officers of the 
bank on 09.01.2004. It was noticed that certain debit entries were made 
in the external clearing account and credited in the accounts of the 

petitioner. These could be made only if any negotiable instrument is 
submitted for clearing. In the case in hand, there was no instrument 
submitted. Even the temporary overdraft granted to the parties was not 
reported to the head office. After the inspection, the fraudulent entries 
were pointed out on 09.01.2004 to the tune of ₹ 1,10,66,100/- (Rupees 
one crore ten lakhs sixty-six thousand and one hundred only) in the 
case of 10 borrowers including the petitioners. Immediately on the next 
date, the payment got deposited by the manager of the bank. It is in 
this factual scenario that the Trial Court convicted the petitioners, and 
the conviction was upheld by the High Court. 
7. 
 
The star argument raised by Senior Counsel appearing for 
the petitioners was that there were 5 separate trials of the accused. 
However, the High Court without discussing the evidence in detail in 
each case separately has upheld the conviction by merely noticing the 
details of the exhibits, the prosecution witnesses and the defence 
witnesses in the matter. The petitioners cannot be said to be the 
persons involved in the cheating. They had not availed any undue 
benefit. Grant of loans by the banks is a normal practice. Security was 
furnished when overdraft facility was granted. Immediately when the 
petitioners were pointed out that the amount is to be returned back, 
they deposited the entire amount. No case of cheating was made out as 

the bank did not suffer any loss. It was a normal business transaction. 
In support of the arguments, reliance was placed upon the judgment of 
this court in A.T. Mydeen and Another vs. Assistant Commissioner, 
Customs Department3. 
8. 
 
After hearing learned counsel for the petitioners, we do not 
find that any case is made out for grant of leave to appeal. As already 
noticed above it is a case where bank officers and the private 
businessmen, two of whom are petitioners before this court, had 
cheated the bank. The fraud started in the year 2002, when without 
there being any instrument submitted to the bank for clearance from 
the accounts in which there was no balance, entries were made in the 
external clearing account and local drafts account for giving credit to 
the petitioners. The entries were made on 27.09.2002 for clearing of 
overdraft of about ₹ 20 lakhs granted to the petitioner/T.R. Vijayaraman 
from July, 2002 onwards, immediately, after the petitioner opened his 
current account with the bank. The modus operandi having come to the 
notice of the higher officers, inspection of the branch was carried out 
on 09.01.2004. When confronted the accused persons got the amount 
deposited immediately on the next day. It came out in the report that 
 
3 (2022): 2021 INSC 697 

advance was enjoyed by the petitioners without payment of any 
interest. It was not a loan transaction as was sought to be argued. 
9. 
 
The argument that the High Court had failed to consider all 
the issues in detail is merely to be noticed and rejected as it was a case 
of confirmation of conviction by the Trial Court. Relevant facts have 
been noticed and relevant evidence discussed by the High Court, as it 
was agreeing with the views expressed by the Trial Court. 
10. 
 
The manner in which the entries were made in the accounts 
could not be disputed. In SLP (Crl.) No.3787 of 2024, the amount 
deposited by the petitioner after the inspection was to the tune of ₹ 
20.05 lakhs (Rupees twenty lakhs and five thousand only) which was ₹ 
21.45 lakhs (Rupees twenty-one lakh and forty-five thousand only) in 
SLP (Crl.) No.3788 of 2024. 
10.1 
The argument that the petitioners did not have any control 
over the bank officials in the manner in which the entries were made in 
the books of accounts, is nothing else but of desperation. All the 
accused in connivance with each other have cheated the bank, by 
submitting cheques of the accounts in which there was no balance, or 
without any submission thereof and entries by the bank officers in the 

books of account showing them to be pending for clearing and giving 
credit to the account holder/accused. 
11. 
 
We may also notice that SLP(Crl.) No.2722 of 2024 filed by 
the R. Geetha, one of the accused account holders in the same FIR, was 
dismissed by this court on 07.03.2024. 
12. 
 
For the reasons mentioned above, we do not find any case 
is made out for grant of leave to appeal. The Special Leave Petitions are 
accordingly dismissed. The petitioners are directed to surrender 
before the concerned Trial Court within 2 weeks from today.
