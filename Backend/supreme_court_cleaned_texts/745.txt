Special Leave Petition (Civil) Nos.32406-07 of 2017 have 
been filed by Legal Representatives (for short “LRs”) of the deceased 
patient seeking enhancement of compensation awarded on account of 
alleged medical negligence, whereas Special Leave Petition (Civil)

parties shall be referred to by their positions before the National

3. 
 
Briefly, the facts available on record are that a complaint2 
was filed before the District Forum3 on 01.08.2003, by the predecessor 
in interest of the petitioners before this Court in Special Leave Petition 
(Civil) Nos.32406-07 of 2017, seeking compensation of ₹14,00,000/- on 
account of death of his wife (late Sheela Malviya). The allegations were 
of medical negligence. She was admitted in the nursing home 
managed by the deceased respondent No.1 Dr. A.H. Memon, who is 
now represented by his LRs, for the treatment of Nasal Polyps. On 
17.08.2001 (pg. no. 17) Endoscopic Polypectomy was performed, 
however, she suffered from cardiac arrest soon after completion of the 
 
1 The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission at New Delhi. 
2 Complaint Number 310 of 2003 
3 District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Raipur (Chhattisgarh). procedure. Since Dr. A.H. Memon’s hospital did not have ventilator 
facility, she was shifted to the opposite party No. 5, Dr. Rajendra 
Banthia’s nursing home on the same day. The patient was given 
treatment for around 19 days at Dr. Rajendra Banthia’s nursing home, 
however her condition remained critical. On 06.09.2001 (page no. G), 
she was shifted to opposite party No.6, Dr. Gautam Darda’s hospital 
where the patient expired on 07.09.2001. 
4. 
 
The District Forum vide order dated 26.07.2006 dismissed 
the complaint qua opposite party Nos.1 to 4 and 6 to 8 before it, namely; 
Dr. A.H. Memon, Dr. M. Arif Memon, Dr. S. Rathi, Dr. Anil Jain, Dr. Aarti 
Gautam Darda, Dr. Chandrika Sahu and Dr. Atul Tiwari. 
5. 
 
The complaint was accepted only qua opposite party No.5 
namely Dr. Rajendra Banthia. He was directed to refund the entire 
treatment charges received by him to the tune of ₹1,20,000/-. 
Additionally, ₹50,000/- was directed to be paid on account of 
deficiency of service and ₹2,000/- were awarded as legal expenses. 
The amount was to be paid with interest @ 9% p.a. from 17.08.2001 till 
realization. 
6. 
 
Aggrieved against the aforesaid order, the complainant 
namely late Shri D.C. Malviya, husband of the deceased and also the 

opposite party No.5 Dr. Rajendra Banthia against whom compensation 
was awarded, filed appeals4 before the State Commission5. Both the 
appeals were dismissed by the State Commission vide order dated 
12.10.2009. 
7. 
 
Still aggrieved, both the aforesaid parties filed Revision 
Petitions6 before the National Commission. The revision petition filed 
by late Shri D.C. Malviya represented through his LRs, was allowed to 
the extent that in addition to the relief already granted by the District 
Forum, opposite party No.1 through LRs and opposite parties No. 2 to 
4 were directed to pay compensation of ₹3,00,000/- jointly and 
severally to the LRs of the complainant. Opposite party 7 and 8 were 
directed to pay ₹50,000/- each for giving contradictory CT Scan 
reports. Cost of ₹20,000/- was also directed to be paid by all opposite 
parties except opposite party No.6. Opposite party No.5, Dr. Rajendra 
Banthia was directed to pay compensation as awarded by District 
Forum. The amount was directed to be paid within four weeks from the 
date of receipt of copy of the order failing which interest @ 9% p.a. was 
payable from the date of filing of complaint till the realization. 
 
4 Appeal Number 457 of 2006 and Appeal Number 472 of 2006 
5 Chhattisgarh State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Pandri, Raipur. 
6 Revision Number 24 of 2010 and Revision Number 382 of 2010 

8. 
 
Aggrieved against the common order passed by the 
National Commission the LRs of the complainant preferred Special 
Leave Petition Nos. 32406-07 of 2017 seeking further enhancement of 
compensation. Opposite party Nos. 5, 7 and 8 also preferred Special 
Leave Petition (Civil) Nos.19478-79 of 2019 challenging the National 
Commission’s order. 
9. 
Brief arguments raised by the learned counsel for the LRs of 
the complainant seeking enhancement of compensation are that once 
the deficiency in service is proved, the compensation had to be 
assessed by applying the multiplier method. It was argued that 
deceased patient being a housewife, her notional income should have 
been taken for calculation of just and fair compensation. 
9.1 
 
It was also submitted that the National Commission did not 
provide any break-up for arriving at the enhanced compensation 
amount. Further, no compensation was awarded on account of future 
prospects, cost of litigation and under other heads. It was also argued 
that the National Commission ought to have awarded interest from the 
date of filing of the complaint. It was not justified in awarding interest 
only upon the opposite parties failing to pay the compensation amount 
within four weeks of the date of the passing of the order. 

10. 
 
On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the 
contesting doctors against whom damages have been awarded 
submitted that it was not a case of deficiency in service as they had 
provided best medical aid, advice and treatment as per the standard 
medical protocols but still the patient could not survive. The amount of 
compensation awarded to the LRs of the complainant should be set 
aside as it will remain a scar on their professional career. 
11. 
 
Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the 
relevant record. 
12. 
 
Firstly, coming to the petitions filed by the contesting 
doctors. A perusal of the paper book and various orders passed by this 
Court shows that notice has not been issued in the same. 
13. 
 
As far as petitions filed by the LRs of the deceased 
complainant are concerned, it is an admitted position that the 
Endoscopic Polypectomy procedure performed on the deceased 
patient was successful. It was after the procedure that the patient 
suffered cardiac arrest, which led her shifting to opposite party No.5, 
Dr. Rajendra Banthia’s nursing home, and subsequently to opposite 
party No.6, Dr. Gautam Darda’s hospital, where she eventually died. It 

was submitted on behalf of the LRs of the deceased patient that the 
opposite parties No. 1 to 4 were negligent in not conducting proper 
pre-anesthetic 
checkup 
before 
performing 
the 
procedure. 
Furthermore, it was submitted that the opposite party No. 5, Dr. 
Rajendra Banthia, who is a general physician, treated the patient 
without referring her to better medical facility in a timely manner. The 
submissions put forth by the LRs of the deceased complainant were 
duly considered by the National Commission, which after considering 
the material available on record provided for additional compensation 
to be paid by the opposite parties. 
14. 
 
The position as it stands today after considering the reliefs 
awarded by the National Commission against different parties is: 
Amount awarded 
(in ₹) 
Towards 
Payable By 
3,00,000/ (jointly 
and severally) 
Medical Expenses, Loss 
of 
Love 
and 
Mental 
Agony. 

Opposite Party No.1 
(Dr. 
A. 
H. 
Memon 
through LRs) 
Opposite Party No. 2 
(Dr. M.Arif Memon) 
Opposite Party No. 3 
(Dr. S. Rathi) 
Opposite Party No. 4 
(Dr. Anil Jain) 
50,000/- 
For giving contradictory 
CT Scan Report. 
Opposite Party No.7 
(Dr. Chandrika Sahu) 
50,000/- 
For giving contradictory 
CT Scan Report. 
Opposite Party No.8 
(Dr. Atul Tiwari) 

20,000/- 
Costs. 
All 
opposite 
parties 
except Opposite Party 
No.6 (Dr. Aarti Gautam 
Darda) 
1,20,000/- 
(with 
interest at 9% p.a. from 17.08.2001) 
Refund of treatment cost. 

Opposite Party No.5 
(Dr. Rajendra Banthia) 
50,000/- 
(with 
interest at 9% p.a. from 17.08.2001) 
 
Compensation 
for 
deficiency in service. 
2000/- 
Legal Costs. 
 
15. 
 
Out of the aforesaid parties, the opposite party No.1 
through LRs and opposite party Nos. 2 to 4 have not challenged the 
order. Whereas in the S.L.P. (C) Nos.19478-19479 of 2019 filed by the 
opposite party No. 5 and opposite party Nos. 7 and 8, notice has not 
been issued. 
16. 
 
From the facts as noticed and on a perusal of the orders 
passed by the different forums, better care of the patient could have 
been taken but the fact remains that she did not survive. She was 51 
years of age at the time of her death. The National Commission has 
awarded additional compensation of ₹3,00,000/- in lumpsum to be paid 
by opposite party No. 1 through LRs and opposite party Nos. 2 to 4, 
along with ₹50,000/- each to be paid by opposite party No. 7 and 8, 
which in our opinion seems to be reasonable and justified, hence, 
deserves no further enhancement. The value of human life cannot be 

assessed in monetary terms whatsoever is awarded is a matter of 
solace. 
17. 
 
We find the reliefs given above are sufficient in S.L.P.(C) 
Nos.32406-32407 of 2017 and hence no case is made out for grant of 
leave in the instant petitions. The same are accordingly dismissed. 
18. 
 
Since the amount involved in the S.L.P. (C) Nos.19478-19479 
of 2019 filed by the contesting doctors is minimal, no notice was issued 
by this Court. We do not find any merit in the present Special Leave 
Petitions as well, which are hereby dismissed.
