3. The issue pertains to the selection and appointment 
to the post of City Manager under the Urban 
Development and Housing Department, Govt.of 
Bihar. The said post is governed by the Bihar City 
Manager 
Cadre 
(Appointment 
and 
Service 
Conditions) Rules, 20141, which were framed under 
Article 309 of the Constitution of India. 
4. For the present case, it is relevant to reproduce Rule 
5 and Rule 11 of Rules 2014, which reads as follows: 
 "Rule 5 - Process of Recruitment, appointment and 
procedure of Recruitment:- (1) Appointment to the basic

Determination of subjects for written examination will

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. OF 2024(C)Nos.9656-57/2023

the Department. 
(ii) Not withstanding anything contain in these Rules, 
where any post in the cadre is vacant due to 
unavailability of suitable candidate or where any post 
is vacant due to leave of anyone or is vacant on 
temporary basis, in the interest of work that post may 
be filled up by suitable qualification holder person by 
deputation/ contract basis. 
 
Rule 11 - Residual matters.- Rules, regulations and 
orders of the State Government for employees of 
suitable level will apply for members of this cadre with 
regard to the matters particularly not covered in these 
Rules or any regulations made under these Rules." 
 
5. Appellants 
issued 
an 
advertisement 
dated 
15.11.2016 under Rules, 2014, for appointment to 
152 posts of City Managers in the State of Bihar. The 
advertisement contained the required information 
regarding the vacancies, eligibility, criteria etc. and 
the selection procedure to be followed for the 
appointment. 
6. In the advertisement, the sub-heading of the 
'Selection Process' states, 
"The commission will prepare a merit list on the basis 
of written examination and experience (for candidates 

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. OF 2024(C)Nos.9656-57/2023

working on the post of City Manager on contract) after 
receiving online applications submitted by eligible 
candidates. Total 100 marks will be determined for 
direct Recruitment. The written examination will be 
conducted of 100 questions and each question carrying 
0.70 marks. 0.70 marks will be given for the correct 
answer and 0.70/4 marks will be deducted for the 
wrong answer. 
Similarly, out of total 100 marks, 70 marks will be 
determined for written examination. Candidates 
working on contract basis on the post of City Manager 
will be given 10 marks per year and maximum 30 
marks for their experience." 
 
7. The sub-heading of the 'Qualifying marks' states 
 
 "The minimum qualifying marks for the candidates for 
the written test are as follows:- 
General Class - 40% 
Backward Class - 36.5% 
Most Backward Class - 34% 
SC/ST - 32% Female - 32%". 
 
8. Under the said advertisement, Respondent No. 1, 
who had no prior work experience, participated in 
the 
written 
examination 
conducted 
by 
the 
appellants for the said post. She achieved 22.575 
marks out of 70 in the written examination. The 

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. OF 2024(C)Nos.9656-57/2023

appellants 
declared 
her 
unsuccessful 
vide 
communication dated 27.12.2019. The reason for 
declaring respondent no. 1 as unsuccessful was that 
she did not obtain the minimum qualifying marks of 
32% as she had secured 22.5 marks in the written 
test and as she had no prior work experience, she 
achieved 0 marks out of 30 for the work experience. 
In totality, she has achieved 22.5 marks out of 100, 
below the minimum requirement of 32%. Meanwhile, 
respondent no. 1 contends that the minimum 
requirement of 32% mentioned in the advertisement 
is just for the written test as per a simple textual 
interpretation. She has achieved 22.5 marks out of 
70, which comes to 32.14%, above the minimum 
qualifying marks of 32%. 
 
9. Dissatisfied with the result communicated to her, 
she approached the High Court by filing a writ 
petition registered as C.W.J.C. No. 7051/2020, 
praying therein for issuance of an appropriate 

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. OF 2024(C)Nos.9656-57/2023

writ/order/direction to the appellants to call her for 
counselling as she was qualified as per the 
advertisement and secured more marks than the 
qualifying marks prescribed for the written test. She 
further prayed for quashing the letter dated 
27.12.2019 and also for issuing directions for giving 
her appointment. 
10. 
The Single Judge allowed the Writ Petition vide 
judgment dated 15.10.2020. The operative part of 
the judgment in favour of respondent No. 1 reads as 
under: 
"Considering the submission of the parties and also on 
consideration of the advertisement which contains the 
qualifying marks, the Court is of the considered view 
that the minimum qualifying marks is relatable to only 
written test and once the candidates qualified in the 
written test he is entitled to be considered for 
preparation of merit list and those candidates who 
qualified in the written test cannot be excluded from 
consideration zone on the ground that the candidates 
failed to obtain qualifying marks over and above 
qualifying marks in the written test. Not only written 
examination but also 40%, 36.5%, 34%, 32% and 32% 
in General, BC, E.B.C., SC/ST and female categories 

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. OF 2024(C)Nos.9656-57/2023

on the basis of total 100 marks which includes written 
test as well as experience. Accordingly, the writ 
petition is disposed of with direction to the respondents 
to consider the case of the Petitioner and alike for 
appointment against the post of City Manager on the 
basis of qualifying marks in the written test and 
prepare merit list. The entire exercise in this regard 
must be completed by the respondents at the earliest 
preferably within a period of three months from the 
date of receipt/production of a copy of this order." 
 
11. 
Aggrieved by the judgment, the appellants filed 
L.P.A. No. 412/2021 before the Division Bench. 
Some candidates also preferred an L.P.A. No. 
109/2021 against the judgment of the Single Judge 
because despite having experience and more marks 
than Respondent No. 1 they would be adversely 
affected by the above judgment. 
12. 
The appellant Commission was relying on an 
Executive Order dated 16.07.2007, which stated 
"Uniform determination of minimum qualifying marks 
for various competitive examinations has been done by 
Resolution Nos. - 15838 dated 22.12.90 and 10258 
dated 05.08.91 in the following form:- 
General Category -40% 

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. OF 2024(C)Nos.9656-57/2023

Backward Class -36.5% 
Backward Class Annexure 1- 34% 
SC/ST & Women Class-32% 
The determination of minimum qualifying marks in the 
above form will be equally applicable to all written 
examinations 
(objective/subjective) 
for 
various 
reservation categories for competitive examinations of 
all services/cadres. Wherever applicable, it will be 
mandatory to obtain above minimum qualifying marks 
in the interview" 
 
13. 
The Division Bench specifically dealt with the 
Executive order dated 16.07.2007 and dismissed the 
said L.P.A.'s for the reasons recorded which are 
reproduced hereunder: 
"Heard learned counsels for the respective parties. 
Core issue involved in the present lis is whether 
Commission has committed error in taking note of 
criteria laid down in the executive order issued under 
Article 166 of the Constitution dated 16.07.2007 as 
one of the criteria for the purpose of City Manager post 
or not? First respondent was candidate for Recruitment 
to the post of City Manager and she was un-successful, 
therefore, she has approached this Court. Her 
grievance is that having regard to the merit read with 
the number of vacancies she is entitled to selection and 
appointment to the post of City Manager and further 
submitted that if Women Reservation (Horizontal 

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. OF 2024(C)Nos.9656-57/2023

Reservation) is given effect even in such circumstances 
the first respondent is entitled. The post of City 
Manager is governed by Rules, 2014. Perusal of Rule 
5 read with Rule 11 there is no adoption of Government 
order dated 16.07.2007 in so far as criteria in other 
words addition to what-ever the procedure prescribed 
in Rule-5 and Rule 11 of Rules, 2014 is relating to the 
present selection and appointment procedure & 
applicability of various Rules & Government Orders in 
so far such of those persons enter the cadre & it is not 
related to selection procedure. On the other hand if any 
Government order subsequent to Rules, whatever the 
government order and Rules are applicable to the City 
Manager Cadre Post. Rule 11 cannot be read with Rule 
5 so as to read additional criteria for the purpose of 
selection and appointment to the post of City Manager. 
Supplant by any material information by means of 
executive order without tinkering the original rule could 
be issued however, in the present, case executive order 
is dated 16.07.2007 on the other hand Rules is of the 
year 2014 there cannot be a supplant of Government 
order dated 16.07.2007 to Rules, 2014. 
In the light of these facts and circumstances, the 
appellant have not made out a case so as to interfere 
with the order of the learned Single Judge…." 
14. 
Aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order 
dated 
20.12.2022 
(Corrected 
on 
23.02.2023), 
Appellants have approached this Court by filing the 
present appeals. 

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. OF 2024(C)Nos.9656-57/2023

15. 
Upon thoroughly examining all the records and 
arguments presented, we find that the impugned 
judgment is justified and correct. The judgment 
warrants no interference. The Division Bench has 
rightly confirmed the judgment passed by the Ld. 
Single Judge. 
16. 
A conjoint reading of the Rules, 2014 in 
particular rules 5 and 11, with the advertisement 
and giving it a pragmatic and 
harmonious 
construction, what emerges is that 32% in the 
written examination would make a candidate eligible 
and qualified to be placed in the consideration zone. 
However, the merit list would be prepared after 
taking into consideration the marks obtained on 
account of experience. Thus, a candidate similar to 
respondent no.1 would be eligible to be considered 
for appointment having scored 32% marks (22.5 
marks out of 70) in the written examination even 
though having no experience. Whereas another 
candidate who has scored 32% marks in the written 

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. OF 2024(C)Nos.9656-57/2023

with three years experience will have scored a total 
of 22.5 plus 30 a total of 52.5 marks out of 100. 
Such a candidate will stand much higher in the 
merit list. The candidate with just qualifying 32% 
marks in the written (22.5 out of 70) with no 
experience will stand almost at the bottom of the 
merit list, but still she will be eligible and qualified 
to be appointed provided the merit list goes as low 
as 22.5 marks out of 100. Another example may be 
referred where a candidate has three years of 
experience (30 marks) but scores only seven marks 
out of 70 in the written test (10% marks in the 
written test) even though the total obtained would be 
37 marks but would not be eligible or qualified to be 
considered as the minimum required marks in the 
written test i.e. 32% has not been obtained by the 
said candidate. 
 
17. 
The required minimum qualifying marks are 
concerned with marks obtained in the written test 

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. OF 2024(C)Nos.9656-57/2023

only, as is evident from the Rules 2014 as also the 
advertisement, and it has no relevance so far as for 
the final preparation of the merit list. The conduct of 
the appellants by not including respondent no. 1 in 
the merit list is not in consonance with the said 
advertisement. 
18. 
The merit list was prepared in terms of Rule 5, 
read with Rule 11 of Rules 2014, which has been 
presented at the beginning of the judgment. Rules 5 
and 11 deal with the process of Recruitment, 
appointment, recruitment procedure, and Residual 
matters. Nowhere in such rules there is mention of 
any minimum qualifying marks required out of a 
total of 100 marks. 
19. 
The appellants have argued that doubts and 
ambiguities in Rules 2014 can be successfully 
cleared using an Executive Order without tinkering 
with the original Rule. In the present case, the 
Executive Order is dated 16.07.2007 which is much 
earlier to the Rules which are of 2014. Therefore, the 

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. OF 2024(C)Nos.9656-57/2023

Executive Order of 2007 is in no way clarificatory or 
explanatory with respect to the Rules of 2014. The 
Division Bench rightly discarded the applicability of 
the Executive Order dated 16.07.2007. The only 
criteria for minimum qualifying marks have been 
mentioned in the Rules 2014 and the advertisement, 
which states that 32 % for women is the minimum 
qualifying marks for the written test (70 marks) and 
not out of 100 marks as interpreted by the 
appellants. 
20. 
The judgment in the case of Employees’ State 
Insurance Corporation vs. Union of India & Ors.2, 
relied upon on behalf of the appellants has no 
application in the facts of the present case. In the 
above judgment one of the issues was whether the 
executive decision will prevail or the statutory 
regulations. This Court, relying upon the settled law, 
held that the statutory regulations will prevail. In 
 
2 (2022) 

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. OF 2024(C)Nos.9656-57/2023

the present case the view taken by the High Court is 
also giving primacy to the Rules 2014 as compared 
to an earlier executive decision dated 16.07.2007. In 
fact the above judgment helps respondent no.1. 
 
21. 
Respondent no. 1 received 22.5 marks out of 
70, 32.14 per cent, above the minimum qualifying 
marks of 32 per cent as per the advertisement. 
Therefore, the appellants were not right by denying 
her a place on the merit list. Impugned judgement 
does not warrant any interference. 
22. 
Accordingly, these appeals are dismissed.
