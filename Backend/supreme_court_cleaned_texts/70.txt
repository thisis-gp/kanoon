Mehta, J. 

1. 
Leave granted. 
2. 
The instant appeal has been preferred by the accused 
appellant who is facing prosecution for the offence punishable 
under Section 500 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 in a complaint filed 
by the respondent-complainant Anand Dubey in the Court of 
Judicial Magistrate First Class, Hoshangabad. The complaint was 
founded on an allegation that the appellant who is the registered 

Criminal Appeal (Crl.) No(s). 3180 of 2020 

owner of a Daily newspaper named ‘Sunday Blast’ having its 
registered office at Malviya Hospital, Kothi Bazar, Hoshangabad 
Tehsil and District Hoshangabad, allowed a news article to be 
published in the edition dated 24th February, 2013 bearing a title 
“Advocate ne pan masala vyavasayi par karaya jhuta mamla darj”. 
3. 
The respondent-complainant filed the subject complaint in 
the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Hoshangabad alleging 
that the appellant had allowed the said news article to be 
published in his newspaper without ascertaining the true facts and 
that such publication brought down the reputation of the 
respondent-complainant in the eyes of the public at large and 
thus, the accused appellant was liable to be prosecuted for 
criminal defamation punishable under Section 500 of the Indian 
Penal Code, 1860. 
4. 
The learned Magistrate, after considering the averments 
made in the complaint and the statement of witnesses examined 
under Sections 200 and 202 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1973(hereinafter being referred to as ‘CrPC’) rejected the same vide 
order dated 12th June, 2017. 
5. 
The respondent-complainant preferred a revision against the 
order dated 12th June, 2017, which came to be allowed by the 

Criminal Appeal (Crl.) No(s). 3180 of 2020 

learned Additional Sessions Judge, Hoshangabad vide order dated 
15th October, 2018 and the order passed by the learned Magistrate 
was reversed. The accused appellant herein challenged the said 
order by filing MCRC No. 44473 of 2018 before the High Court of 
Madhya Pradesh which dismissed the same vide order dated 29th 
January, 2020. The order dated 29th January, 2020 and all further 
proceedings of the complaint are assailed in the present appeal. 
6. 
No one has appeared to contest the appeal on behalf of the 
respondent-complainant despite service. 
7. 
We have considered the submissions advanced on behalf of 
the appellant and have gone through the material placed on record 
including the orders passed by the Courts below as well as the 
High Court. 
8. 
Having considered the entirety of the material available on 
record, we find that the order dated 12th June, 2017 passed by the 
learned Magistrate First Class, Hoshangabad rejecting the 
complaint of the respondent-complainant is a well-reasoned order. 
The learned Magistrate in its order referred to the Fundamental 
Right of Freedom of Speech and Expression enshrined under 
Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India and held that the 
publication in question did not warrant prosecution of the accused 

Criminal Appeal (Crl.) No(s). 3180 of 2020 

appellant for the offence punishable under Section 500 of the 
Indian Penal Code, 1860. We are also of the view that the news 
article in question was published in good faith and in exercise of 
the Fundamental Right of Freedom of Speech and Expression 
enshrined under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. 
9. 
As an upshot of above discussion, we are of the opinion that 
the view taken by the learned Magistrate cannot be termed to be 
illegal or unjustified warranting interference by the High Court in 
exercise of the revisional jurisdiction. 
10. Resultantly, the order dated 15th October, 2018 passed by the 
learned Additional Sessions Judge as well as the order dated 29th 
January, 2020 passed by the High Court are quashed and set 
aside. 
11. As a consequence, all proceedings sought to be taken against 
the accused appellant in pursuance of the complaint filed by the 
respondent-complainant under Section 500 of the Indian Penal 
Code, 1860 are also quashed. 
12. The appeal stands allowed accordingly.
