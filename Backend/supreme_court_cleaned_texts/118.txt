CRIMINAL APPEAL NO(S). OF 2024 
 
 ( SLP(Crl.) No(s). 3169 of 2023) 

JUDGMENT 
 
Mehta, J. 
 
1. 
Leave granted. 
2. 
Heard learned counsel representing the parties and perused 
the material available on record. 
3. 
The appellants-Farhana and Sadarul Islam have filed the 
instant appeals for assailing the orders dated 14th November, 2022 
and 6th December, 2022 passed by the Division Bench of the High 
Court of Judicature at Allahabad rejecting Criminal Miscellaneous 

Writ Petition Nos. 16653 of 2022 and 18326 of 2022 preferred by 
the appellants respectively, with a prayer to quash the Case Crime 
No. 424 of 2022 registered against the appellants for the offence 
punishable under Section 3(1) of the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and 
Anti-Social Activities(Prevention) Act, 1986(for short ‘Gangsters 
Act’) at Police Station-Bhognipur, District-Kanpur Dehat. 
4. 
The short issue presented for adjudication in these appeals 
is as to whether the proceedings of the FIR under the provisions of 
the Gangsters Act and the prosecution of the accused can be 
continued in spite of exoneration in the predicate offences covered 
by Section 2(b)(i) of Gangsters Act. For the sake of convenience, 
Section 2(b)(i) of the Gangsters Act is quoted hereinbelow:- 
“2(b) “Gang” means a group of persons, who acting either 
singly or collectively, by violence, or threat or show of 
violence, or intimidation, or coercion or otherwise with the 
object of disturbing public order or of gaining any undue 
temporal, pecuniary, material or other advantage for himself 
or any other person, indulge in anti-social activities, 
namely— 

offences punishable under Chapter XVI, or 
Chapter XVII, or Chapter XXII of the 
Indian Penal Code, or…..” 
 
5. 
The FIR impugned before the High Court came to be 
registered against the appellants at the instance of the inspector 
in-charge of the Police Station, Kanpur Dehat alleging inter alia 
that the appellants, being the members of a gang led by Puskal 

Parag Dubey, were involved in following criminal cases:- (1) Crime 
Case No. 190 of 2021 under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 323, 504 
and 506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860(for short ‘IPC’) and 
(2)Crime Case No. 173 of 2019 under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 
IPC against Sadarul Islam and (3) Crime Case No. 173 of 2019 
under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 IPC against Farhana and, thus, 
they were liable to be prosecuted for the offences punishable under 
the Gangsters Act. The FIR further narrated that the gang has 
criminal history and with a view to impose a restriction on the 
activities of the gang, the FIR was being registered after obtaining 
prior approval pertaining to the Gang Chart from the District 
Magistrate under Section 3(1) of the Gangsters Act. 
6. 
The appellants assailed the aforesaid FIR by way of filing the 
captioned criminal writ petitions before the High Court on the 
premise that as on the date of the filing of the FIR, only one case 
was registered against them and hence, the proceedings under 
Section 3(1) of the Gangsters Act were liable to be quashed and set 
aside. 
7. 
Learned Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at 
Allahabad considered the ratio of the judgment rendered by this 
Court in the case of Shraddha Gupta v. State of Uttar Pradesh 

and Others1 wherein it was held that prosecution under the 
Gangsters Act can be initiated even against the person who is 
involved in a single offence/FIR/charge-sheet for any of the anti-
social activities mentioned in Section 2(b) of the Gangsters Act and 
rejected the criminal writ petitions by the impugned orders dated 
14th November, 2022 and 6th December, 2022 which have been 
assailed in the present appeals. 
8. 
Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the 
decision rendered in the case of Shraddha Gupta(supra) would 
not apply to the case of the appellants because in the intervening 
period, proceedings of both the criminal cases being Crime Case 
No. 173 of 2019 and Crime Case No. 190 of 2021 have been 
quashed in the following manner:- (i) 
Crime Case No. 173 of 
2019 registered against both the appellants, namely, Farhana and 
Sadarul Islam was quashed by the High Court of Judicature at 
Allahabad, vide order dated 3rd March, 2023, passed in Application 
under Section 482 No. 7228 of 2023; (ii) Crime Case No. 190 of 
2021 registered against appellant Sadarul Islam was also quashed 
by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad vide order dated 18th 
 
1 2022 SCCOnline SC 514 

October, 2023, passed in Application under Section 482 No. 18493 
of 2023. 
9. 
On these grounds, learned counsel for the appellants urged 
that there being no on-going prosecution of the appellants for any 
offence(s) involving anti-social activities as defined in Section 2(b)(i) 
of the Gangsters Act, the continuation of the proceedings of the 
criminal case and the charge-sheet filed against the appellants 
pursuant to investigation of Case Crime No. 424 of 2022 under the 
Gangsters Act is absolutely unjustified and tantamounts to abuse 
of process of the Court. 
10. On these submissions, he implored the Court to accept the 
appeals and quash the proceedings of the criminal case pending 
against the appellants in the jurisdictional Court. 
11., learned counsel representing the State urged that 
there is no dispute that at the time of registration of FIR, the 
appellants were being prosecuted for multiple FIRs involving anti-
social offences as defined under Section 2(b)(i) of the Gangsters Act 
and hence, the proceedings of the FIR under the Gangsters Act 
cannot be quashed in light of decision rendered by this Court in 
the case of Shraddha Gupta(supra). 

12. From a bare perusal of Section 2(b)(i) of the Gangsters Act, it 
would become apparent that the person alleged to be the member 
of the gang should be found indulging in anti-social activities 
which would be covered under the offences punishable under 
Chapters XVI, or XVII or XXII IPC. There is no dispute that the 
case set up by the prosecution against the appellants insofar as 
the offences under the Gangsters Act are concerned, is limited to 
Section 2(b)(i) reproduced supra and none of the other clauses of 
the provision have been pressed into service for the proposed 
prosecution. 
13. Needless to say that for framing a charge for the offence under 
the Gangsters Act and for continuing the prosecution of the 
accused under the above provisions, the prosecution would be 
required to clearly state that the appellants are being prosecuted 
for any one or more offences covered by anti-social activities as 
defined under Section 2(b). 
14. There being no dispute that in the proceedings of the sole FIR 
registered against the appellants for the offences under Chapter 
XVII IPC being Crime Case No. 173 of 2019, the appellants stand 
exonerated with the quashing of the said FIR by the High Court of 
Judicature at Allahabad by exercising the powers under Section 

482 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, vide order dated 3rd 
March, 2023 passed in Application No. 7228 of 2023. 
15. Hence, the very foundation for continuing the prosecution of 
the appellants under the provisions of the Gangsters Act stands 
struck off and as a consequence, the continued prosecution of the 
appellants for the said offence is unjustified and tantamounts to 
abuse of the process of Court. 
16. As a consequence of the discussion made herein above, the 
impugned orders dated 14th November, 2022 and 6th December, 
2022 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad are 
quashed and set aside. Resultantly, the impugned FIR being 
Crime Case No.424 of 2022 for offence punishable under Section 
3(1) of the Gangsters Act, registered at Police Station- Bhognipur, 
District- Kanpur Dehat and all the proceedings sought to be taken 
thereunder against the appellants are hereby quashed. 
17. The appeals are allowed accordingly. 
18. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
