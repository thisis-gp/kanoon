CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. OF 2024 
( SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023) 

KUNHIMUHAMMED…APPELLANT 
VERSUS 
THE STATE OF KERALA 
 …RESPONDENT 
JUDGMENT 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 
1. Leave granted. 
2. This appeal assails the correctness of the judgment 
and order dated 18.09.2018 whereby the appeal of 
the appellant-accused no.1, against his conviction 
under sections 302, 324 and 326/34 of Indian 
Penal Code, 18601 has been dismissed. The 
prosecution story in brief is: 
 
1 IPC 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

2.1. On 10.04.2006, the sympathizers of United 
Democratic Front (UDF) and Left Democratic 
Front (LDF) fought against each other in 
connection with the dispute regarding the 
drawing of their election symbol at a place near a 
library in Kunnappalli, Pathaikkara Village. A 
criminal case with non-bailable offences was 
registered against the sympathisers of UDF in 
connection with the above incident. 
2.2. 
On 11.04.2006, The appellant along with the 
other accused who are sympathisers of Indian 
Union Muslim League on account of above enmity 
and with the intention to commit murder of 
deceased Subrahmannian and CW-1 Vasudevan 
Ramachandra, waited at Mukkilaplavu Junction 
for their arrival and at about 08:45 PM when the 
deceased along with Vasudevan Ramachandra 
reached at the above-mentioned place, the first 
accused attempted to beat the deceased with a 
tamarind stick, on his head. The deceased saved 
himself from the said attack and snatched the 
stick from the first accused and started 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

assaulting the first accused on his forehead and 
back with the same stick. At this stage, the first 
accused took out a knife from his hip region and 
stabbed the deceased on the left side of chest, 
back of the head and the left shoulder. On seeing 
the above incident, CW-1 made an attempt to 
obstruct the first accused from assaulting the 
deceased, however, the first accused stabbed him 
on the left side of the buttock of CW-1 with the 
same knife. When CW-1 fell on the ground, the 
second accused caused a fracture on the right 
foot bone of CW-1 by beating him with another 
tamarind stick. Thereafter, the third accused 
assaulted CW-1 by beating on his right chest with 
a wooden stick. 
2.3. After the said incident, the injured and the 
deceased were taken to the Maulana Hospital 
where Additional Sub-Inspector CW-32 reached 
and recorded the statement of CW-1 on the basis 
of which the First Information Report was 
registered as Crime No.260 of 2006 against the 
three accused under sections 302/324 read with 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

section 34 IPC. The accused were thereafter 
arrested. The Investigating Officer prepared the 
inquest report, spot map, and recovered the knife 
under the seizure memo on the basis of the 
disclosure statement made by the first accused. 
2.4. 
After completing the investigation, the charge 
sheet was submitted under sections 302/307 
read with section 34 IPC. The Magistrate took 
cognizance and committed the case for trial to the 
Sessions Court. The Trial Court framed the 
charges under the aforesaid sections and read 
them over to the accused who denied the same 
and claimed trial. 
3. The Prosecution examined 19 witnesses and filed 

Exhibits 
and 

material 
objects. 
The 
statements of the accused under section 313 of 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 19732 were recorded 
wherein again they claimed that they were innocent 
and had nothing to do with the said incident. They 
claimed to have been falsely implicated on account 
 
2 CrPC 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

of political rivalry at the instance of the leaders of 
Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M). 
4. The Trial Court after appreciating the evidence led 
by the parties held that the appellant was found 
guilty of offences punishable under sections 302, 
324 and 326/34 IPC and accordingly sentenced 
him to life imprisonment with a fine of Rs.1 Lakh 
under section 302, IPC, six years rigorous 
imprisonment with a fine of Rs.25,000/- under 
section 326, IPC, and two years imprisonment 
under section 324, IPC. Accused no.2 was found 
guilty of offences punishable under section 326 and 
under sections 324/34 IPC and he was sentenced 
to six years imprisonment under section 326, IPC 
with a fine of Rs.25,000/- and two years rigorous 
imprisonment under section 324 IPC. The third 
accused was also awarded the same sentence as 
accused 
no.2. 
The 
sentences 
were 
to 
run 
concurrently. 
5. Three appeals were preferred before the High Court 
by the three accused separately. The High Court by 
the impugned order dismissed all the three appeals. 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

The second accused and the third accused had 
preferred a separate SLP registered as SLP(Crl.) 
No.2822 of 2019. In the said SLP, leave was 
granted, and it was partly allowed vide judgment 
and order dated 29.07.2019. This Court extended 
benefit of doubt to accused no.3 whereas accused 
no.2’s 
conviction 
was 
upheld, 
however, 
his 
sentence under section 326 for six years was 
reduced to three years. 
6. We have heard Shri Nikhil Goel, learned senior 
counsel appearing for the appellant and Shri P.V. 
Dinesh, learned senior counsel appearing for the 
State of Kerala and perused the material on record. 
The submissions of Shri Goel are limited to the 
extent that this was not a case of premeditated pre 
planned murder. There was no mens rea for 
committing 
culpable 
homicide 
amounting 
to 
murder. The intention was only of assaulting with 
the stick but later on during the fight as the 
deceased overpowered the appellant and started 
assaulting him with the same stick after snatching 
it from the appellant, the appellant pulled out the 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

knife from his back and stabbed the deceased and 
also the injured to save him. He has drawn 
attention to the evidence on record as also to the 
judgment of the Trial Court wherein specific finding 
was recorded to that extent by the Trial Court but 
despite the same, the Trial Court proceeded to 
record conviction under section 302 IPC and not 
section 304 IPC. 
7. He also submitted that the appellant is aged 67 
years and is suffering from multiple ailments and 
that having undergone almost twelve and half years 
of actual sentence, this Court may consider 
reducing the sentence by converting the conviction 
to under section 304 IPC Part II. 
8. On the other hand, Mr. P.V. Dinesh, learned senior 
counsel 
appearing 
for 
the 
respondent-State 
submitted that the Trial Court and the High Court 
have both dealt with this aspect of the matter and 
have concurrently found that this was a case of 
culpable homicide amounting to murder. The fact 
that the appellant was carrying a knife and the 
number of assaults made by him on the deceased 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

as also the injury would clearly show that the 
intention was to commit murder. 
9. Having heard the learned counsels for the parties, 
we find it imperative to look into the evidence, 
witness testimonies, and injury reports to better 
understand and analyse the incident to see whether 
the culpable homicide in the present case amounts 
to murder or not. A meticulous analysis of the 
evidence on record is necessary to check whether 
the appellant had the intention to kill the deceased 
or if he can be given the benefit of reduction of 
sentence on the grounds pleaded in the appeal. To 
understand the evidence and their probative value 
in establishing the offence, it is necessary to look at 
the categorical findings of both the courts below. 
FINDINGS OF THE TRIAL COURT 
10. The Trial Court found appellant guilty of offences 
under Sections 302, 326, and 324, IPC. The Trial 
Court’s findings were primarily based on the direct 
testimony of PW1, an eyewitness who was also 
injured in the incident, and corroborative evidence 
from medical and forensic reports. 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

11. The 
evidence 
of 
PW1 
was 
crucial 
to 
the 
prosecution’s case. The Trial Court carefully 
analyzed his testimony and found it credible, 
reliable, and consistent with the injuries sustained 
by the deceased and PW1, as recorded in the 
medical reports. Although the defense argued that 
PW1 was an interested witness and highlighted 
omissions and contradictions in his testimony, the 
Trial Court concluded that these discrepancies 
were minor and did not affect the core narrative. 
The Trial Court also noted that PW1’s statements 
were corroborated by PW2, who arrived at the scene 
shortly after the incident and observed the accused 
fleeing. PW2’s account was deemed trustworthy 
and supported the prosecution's version. 
12. The recovery of the murder weapon (a knife, marked 
as MO1) at the instance of appellant was a 
significant factor in the Trial Court’s findings. The 
knife was recovered under Section 27 of the Indian 
Evidence Act, 1872 based on information provided 
by appellant during his custodial interrogation. 
Forensic examination confirmed that the knife bore 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

human blood matching the deceased's blood group. 
This finding provided compelling corroboration of 
PW1’s testimony regarding the role of Accused No. 
1 in the fatal assault. Additional physical evidence, 
such as blood-stained sticks recovered from the 
crime 
scene, 
further 
substantiated 
the 
prosecution’s case. 
13. Medical evidence also played a vital role. The 
postmortem report of the deceased, prepared by 
PW-6 (a police surgeon), confirmed that the cause 
of death was multiple stab injuries inflicted with a 
sharp-edged weapon like MO1. PW6 identified 
specific fatal injuries to the heart and lungs, which 
were consistent with the prosecution’s narrative of 
the assault. Similarly, the wound certificate of PW1 
corroborated his account of the injuries he 
sustained during the attack. The Trial Court 
observed that the injuries detailed in the medical 
reports aligned with the testimonies of PW1 and 
PW2, reinforcing the prosecution’s case. 
14. The defense attempted to argue that the incident 
occurred in the exercise of private defense, claiming 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

that the accused were attacked by CPI(M) workers, 
including the deceased and PW1. However, the Trial 
Court 
rejected 
this 
claim, 
finding 
it 
unsubstantiated and improbable. The injuries on 
appellant, documented in the wound certificate, 
were deemed minor and inconsistent with the 
defense’s narrative of a large-scale attack. The 
Court concluded that the accused were the 
aggressors and were not entitled to claim the right 
of private defense. 
15. Ultimately, 
the 
Trial 
Court 
held 
that 
the 
prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt 
that appellant intentionally caused the death of 
Subrahmannian and grievously injured PW1. The 
recovery of the murder weapon, corroborative 
forensic and medical evidence, and the reliable 
testimony of PW1 and PW2 were central to this 
conclusion. Accordingly, appellant was convicted 
under Sections 302, 326, and 324 IPC and 
sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder 
charge, along with additional terms for the other 
offenses. 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

FINDINGS OF THE HIGH COURT 
 
16. The High Court of Kerala meticulously analyzed the 
roles and culpability of each accused based on the 
evidence presented during the trial. The findings 
highlight the distinct involvement of each accused 
in the crime, with a particular focus on the actions 
of appellant. This comprehensive assessment 
ensures that the degree of liability is proportionate 
to their individual actions and intentions as 
discerned from the evidence on record. 
17. The High Court affirmed the findings of the Trial 
Court that Accused No. 1 played a pivotal role in 
the murder. The evidence of PW-1, an injured 
eyewitness, 
was 
central 
to 
establishing 
the 
sequence of events. PW-1 testified that appellant 
first beat the deceased with a wooden stick, causing 
injuries to his left shoulder. When the deceased 
tried to flee, appellant – accused no. 1 drew the 
knife and inflicted a stab wound to his back. As PW-
1 intervened to protect the deceased, appellant–
turned on him, stabbing him in the buttock. This 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

act of aggression was corroborated by medical 
evidence, which indicated that PW-1 sustained 
injuries consistent with the use of the weapon 
recovered during the investigation. Despite PW-1's 
injuries, appellant resumed his attack on the 
deceased, stabbing him multiple times in the chest 
and other vital areas. 
18. The High Court emphasized the significance of the 
post-mortem report, which revealed eight incised 
wounds on the deceased, including fatal injuries to 
the chest, heart, and lungs. PW-6, the police 
surgeon, 
testified 
that 
these 
injuries 
were 
consistent with the knife recovered and that the 
fatal wounds were sufficient in the ordinary course 
of nature to cause death. The chemical analysis 
linking 
the 
knife 
to 
appellant 
was 
further 
corroborated by the presence of human blood 
matching the deceased’s blood group on the 
weapon. The recovery of the knife, facilitated by a 
disclosure statement from appellant, lent further 
credence to the prosecution’s case. 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

19. The High Court also addressed the appellant’s 
argument that the testimony of PW-1 was 
unreliable due to alleged embellishments regarding 
the number of stab injuries. The Court rejected this 
contention, noting that minor omissions in the First 
Information Statement (FIS) could not undermine 
the credibility of PW-1’s account, especially given 
the traumatic circumstances under which the FIS 
was recorded. The court reasoned that PW-1, 
having sustained a stab injury himself, may not 
have been able to provide exhaustive details at the 
time but consistently identified appellant – accused 
no. 1 as the primary assailant. The testimony of 
PW-2, an independent eyewitness, corroborated 
PW-1’s 
account, 
further 
strengthening 
the 
prosecution’s case against appellant. 
20. The High Court concluded that the actions of 
appellant demonstrated clear intent to cause death. 
The deliberate targeting of vital organs with a sharp 
weapon indicated premeditation or, at the very 
least, the formation of intent during the incident. 
The court observed that while the altercation may 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

have initially involved the use of sticks, appellant’s 
decision to escalate the violence by drawing and 
using a knife was an intentional and unilateral act. 
This conduct set him apart from the other accused, 
whose actions were limited to assaulting the victims 
with sticks. 
21. In contrast, accused nos. 2 and 3 were found guilty 
of lesser offenses under Section 326 IPC for causing 
grievous hurt to PW-1. The evidence established 
that they used sticks to beat PW-1, resulting in 
non-fatal injuries, including a fracture to his leg. 
The High Court concurred with the Trial Court’s 
finding that there was insufficient evidence to prove 
that Accused Nos. 2 and 3 shared a common 
intention with appellant to commit murder. The 
court noted that there was no evidence to suggest 
that they were aware of the knife concealed by 
appellant or his intent to use it. This lack of 
knowledge precluded the application of Section 34, 
IPC to hold them vicariously liable for the murder. 
22. The High Court underscored the principle that 
liability must be determined based on the specific 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

actions and intentions of each accused. While 
accused nos. 2 and 3 were complicit in the assault, 
their participation did not extend to the homicidal 
attack perpetrated by accused no. 1. The court 
further noted that the initial assault with sticks did 
not indicate a pre-arranged plan to kill the 
deceased. Had there been such an intention, the 
attack would have begun with the use of the knife 
rather than sticks. 
23. The High court also dismissed the appellant’s plea 
for leniency based on parity with the co-accused. It 
emphasized that the role of appellant was 
materially different and far more culpable than that 
of accused Nos. 2 and 3. The fatal injuries inflicted 
by appellant on the deceased were deliberate, 
targeted, and intended to cause death, whereas the 
actions of the co-accused were confined to non-fatal 
assaults on PW-1. The principle of parity, therefore, 
did not apply in this case. 
24. The High Court upheld the conviction of appellant 
under Section 302 IPC for the murder of 
Subrahmannian. The court noted that the evidence 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

against 
him 
was 
overwhelming, 
including 
eyewitness testimonies, medical reports, and 
forensic findings. The sentences imposed on 
Accused Nos. 2 and 3 under Section 326 IPC were 
also affirmed, as they appropriately reflected their 
limited roles in the incident. 
FINDINGS ON THE GROUNDS FOR REDUCTION OF 
SENTENCE 
25. SCUFFLE AND LACK OF INTENT: The appellant's 
counsel has argued that the incident arose out of a 
scuffle between two rival factions, during which the 
act of stabbing and killing the deceased was not 
premeditated but rather occurred spontaneously in 
the heat of the moment. According to the appellant, 
there was no deliberate intent to commit murder, 
and the unfortunate event resulted from a 
confrontation that escalated during the altercation. 
However, 
this 
submission 
has 
been 
closely 
examined and dismissed by both the Trial Court 
and the High Court, based on substantial evidence 
presented during the proceedings. 
A. Fatal Injuries: 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

25.1 The severity of the injuries inflicted on the 
deceased has been central to the Courts’ 
conclusion that the act qualifies as murder under 
Section 300 of the IPC. As per the post-mortem 
report, the deceased sustained both external and 
internal ante-mortem injuries that were identified 
as being inflicted by a sharp-edged knife. These 
injuries, detailed in the Trial Court's order, 
include multiple incised penetration wounds to 
vital regions such as the chest, rib cage, lungs, 
and heart. 
25.2 The evidence of PW-6, the police surgeon who 
conducted the post-mortem examination, was 
instrumental in establishing the fatal nature of 
the injuries. He testified that the death resulted 
from multiple injuries, including several incised 
wounds caused by the knife recovered during the 
investigation. The injuries sustained by the 
deceased, as per the report, were as follows: 
External Antemortem Injuries: 
1. (a) Incised wound 4x2x0.5cm involving back of 
right side of head, horizontal, upper inner end at 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

2 cm below occiput and 2 cm outer to midline 
back, with tapering ends. 
2. Incised penetrating wound 12x3xl-2cm involving 
top and back of left shoulder, extending vertically 
downwards and backwards, upper inner end at 
17 cm outer to mid line front and on top of 
shoulder. 
3. (a) Incised penetrating wound (stab wounds) 
3x2x3.5cm involving front of left chest, oblique, 
upper end near to midline front than lower, upper 
inner end at 12 cm outer to midline front and II 
cm below middle of collar bone, directed 
downwards. backwards and right wards, with 
tapering ends, and contusion of margins. 
4. (a) Incised penetrating wound (stab wound) 
2xl.5x3.5cm including · front of right chest, 
oblique, upper end away from midline front than 
lower end, upper inner end at 10 cm outer to 
midline front and 17 cm below middle of collar 
bone, directed downwards, backwards and 
leftwards, with tapering ends and contusion of 
margins. 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

5. Incised wound 2x0.8x0.5cm involving dorsum of 
left hand at the root of middle finger. 
Internal Antemortem Injuries: 
1. (b) Contusions of scalp 17x10 em involving front 
half and 5x3cm involving right side of back. Inter 
one is. under neath and around the injury No. 1 
-(a). 
2. (b) (i) contusion 23x9cm involving left front chest 
wall upper inner end at collar bone and in midline 
front. 

Incised penetrating wound 8x0.5x I cm 
involving left front chest wall (rib cage and inter 
costal muscles), oblique, which penetrates into 
chest cavity, with fracture separation of 3rd 
and 4th ribs and contusion of edges the upper 
inner end at I 0 cm outer to midline front and 
9 cm below middle of collar bone. 
(iii) Incised 
penetrating 
wound 
7x2x1.5 
em 
involving left atrium and upper part of left 
ventricle of heart, which penetrates through 
entire thickness of antero lateral wall into 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

cavity, tearing mitral valve leaflets, with 
contusion at the edges of the wound. 

Laceration of left lung 4xlx0.5cm involving 
outer aspect of upper lobe and 2x2x0.5cm 
including outer aspect · of lower lobe and 
contusion 6x3 cm involving outer aspect of 
lower lobe just below the previous injury 
Injury No. 3 (b) is underneath and corresponds 
with and continuation of injury no. (3) (a), and 
total depth of both injuries taken together is 6 
cm. 
4.(b) (i) Contusion 10x7 cm involving right front 
chest wall upper inner end at 13 cm belowcollar 
bone and in midline front. 
(ii) Incised penetrating wound 4x2x2cm involving 
right front chest wall (rib cage and intercostale 
muscles), oblique, penetrates into the chest 
cavity, with fracture separation of 5th rib, the 
upper inner end at 9 cm outer to midline front 
and 20 cm below middle of collar bone, with 
contusion of edges. 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

(iii) Laceration of right lung 2xlx0.5 cm involving 
outer aspect of middle lobe. 
Injury No. (4) (b) is underneath, corresponds 
with and continuation of injury No. (4) (a) and 
the total depth of both injuries taken together 
is 5 cm. 
25.3 Among the injuries, some were specifically 
identified as fatal, including: 
i. Penetrating wounds to the chest and rib 
cage. These injuries caused significant trauma 
to the internal organs, including the lungs and 
heart. ii. Laceration of the heart. The most critical 
injury involved a penetrating wound measuring 
7x2x1.5 cm in the left atrium and the upper part 
of the left ventricle, which extended through the 
entire thickness of the anterolateral wall of the 
heart. This injury also tore the mitral valve 
leaflets and caused contusions at the edges of 
the wound. The medical expert opined that this 
particular injury was sufficient to cause death 
in the ordinary course of nature. Additionally, 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

other injuries inflicted on the deceased were of 
such severity that they compounded the fatal 
outcome. 
25.4 This Court held in Virsa Singh vs. State of 
Pepsu3, that to see whether the injury intended 
and thus caused by the accused was sufficient in 
the ordinary course of nature to cause death or 
not, it must be examined in each case on the 
basis of the facts and circumstances. In that 
case, the injury was caused with a knife blow to 
the stomach and it was inflicted with such force 
that the knife penetrated the abdomen of the 
deceased and caused injuries to the bowel. The 
expert opinion of the doctor therein stated on 
record that such an injury was sufficient in the 
ordinary course of nature to cause death. 
Further, in the absence of any evidence or 
circumstances to prove that the injury was 
accidental or unintentional, it was presumed that 
the accused had intended to cause such injury, 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

thus making it fall under clause 3 of Section, 300 
IPC. 
25.5 It has been held by this Court in several cases 
such as Manubhai Atabhai vs. State of 
Gujarat4, and Arun Nivalaji More vs. State of 
Maharashtra5, that when the ocular evidence of 
eye witnesses are reliable and well corroborated 
by medical, and other evidence also inspires the 
confidence that the accused had the intention to 
cause such fatal injuries, then such evidence is 
enough to prove the charge of murder beyond 
reasonable doubt. This intention is to be gathered 
from a number of circumstances and evidence 
like the place of injury the nature of the weapon, 
the force applied while inflicting the injury, and 
other such considerations. Whether the accused 
had any intention to kill the deceased has to be 
judged upon taking into consideration the facts 
of each case. 
 
4 (2007) 
5 (2005) 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

25.6 This position has been elaborated by this Court 
in the case of Nishan Singh vs. State of Punjab6, 
where the accused person had snatched the 
weapon carried by someone else and brutally 
inflicted injuries on the deceased. The Court 
stated that in such a case it cannot be said that 
he did not have the intention to cause death. 
25.7 The prosecution established beyond doubt that 
these injuries were inflicted by the appellant–
accused no. 1 using a knife, which was recovered 
during the investigation based on the appellant’s 
disclosure statement. PW-18, the Investigating 
Officer, corroborated this recovery, and the 
seizure report was further attested by PW-16, an 
independent witness. Further, the doctor PW-6 
has stated that these injuries are sufficient to 
cause death in the ordinary course of nature. 
Cross-examination of these witnesses did not 
reveal any inconsistencies that could undermine 
the credibility of the evidence. Consequently, the 
 
6 (2008) 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

courts have rightly concluded that the fatal 
injuries inflicted by the appellant were the direct 
cause of the deceased’s death. 
B. Intention to Commit Murder 
25.8 The appellant's primary defence has been the 
absence of intent to commit murder. However, 
intent can be inferred from the circumstances 
surrounding the act, including the nature and 
location of the injuries inflicted, the weapon used, 
and the actions of the appellant during the 
incident. The injuries were concentrated on the 
vital parts of the deceased’s body, such as the 
chest and ribs, which house critical organs like 
the heart and lungs. The deliberate targeting of 
these areas indicates a clear intent to cause harm 
that could lead to death. According to the 
testimony of the injured eyewitness, the appellant 
stabbed the deceased with considerable force, 
further corroborating the prosecution’s argument 
that the injuries were inflicted intentionally or at 
least with the knowledge of their natural 
consequence. While other co-accused were 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

reportedly armed with sticks, the appellant–
accused no. 1 was in possession of a sharp knife, 
which was used to inflict severe injuries. The 
decision to carry and use such a weapon during 
the scuffle reflects a readiness to escalate 
violence beyond a mere physical altercation. Even 
if the appellant did not have a prior intention to 
murder 
the 
deceased, 
the 
circumstances 
demonstrate that such injuries were caused 
which were sufficient in the ordinary course to 
cause death. The deliberate act of stabbing vital 
parts of the body, coupled with the force used, 
indicates that the appellant must have been 
aware of the likely fatal consequences of his 
actions. Under the provisions of Section 300 IPC, 
an intention to cause such injuries that are 
sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to 
cause death qualifies as murder, and even if 
ingredients other than intention to cause murder 
are proved, mere knowledge of the result of fatal 
actions is enough to ascribe culpability to the 
accused person. 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

25.9 The lower courts have also dismissed the 
appellant’s argument that the act was not 
premeditated. While the attack may not have 
been planned in advance, intent can emerge in 
the heat of the moment, particularly during a 
violent confrontation. The appellant’s decision to 
use a lethal weapon and the precise targeting of 
the victim’s vital organs are sufficient to establish 
the requisite intent for murder or at least 
knowledge of the possible consequences of one’s 
actions and to hold the appellant liable for death 
of the deceased as per clause 3 of Section 300, 
IPC. 
25.10 This Court held in Virsa Singh (Supra), that the 
prosecution must prove that there was an 
intention to inflict that particular injury, that is 
to say that the injury was not accidental or 
unintentional or that some other kind of injury 
was intended, and that particular injury was 
sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to 
cause death. 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

25.11 The third clause of section 300 speaks of an 
intention to cause bodily injury which is 
sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to 
cause death. This Court in the above-mentioned 
judgment held that to bring the case under this 
part of the section the prosecution must establish 
objectively: 
1. That a bodily injury is present; 
2. That the nature of injury must be proved; 
3. It must be proved that there was an intention 
to inflict that particular bodily injury; 
4. That the injury inflicted is sufficient to cause 
death in the ordinary course of the nature. 
25.12 The Court further held that: 
“13. 
Once 
these 
four 
elements 
are 
established by the prosecution (and, of 
course, the burden is on the prosecution 
throughout) the offence is murder under S. 
300, “Thirdly. It does not matter that there 
was no intention to cause death. It does 
not matter that there was no intention 
even to cause an injury of a kind that is 
sufficient to cause death in the ordinary 
course of nature (not that there is any real 
distinction between the two). It does not 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

even matter that there is no knowledge 
that an act of that kind will be likely to 
cause death. Once the intention to cause 
the bodily injury actually found to be 
present is proved, the rest of the enquiry is 
purely objective and the only question is 
whether, as a matter of purely objective 
inference, the injury is sufficient in the 
ordinary course of nature to cause death. 
No one has a licence to run around 
inflicting injuries that are sufficient to 
cause death in the ordinary course of 
nature and claim that they are not guilty of 
murder. If they inflict injuries of that kind, 
they must face the consequences; and they 
can only escape if it can be shown, or 
reasonably deduced that the injury was 
accidental or otherwise unintentional.” 
25.13 This position has further been upheld by this 
Court recently in the case of Vinod Kumar vs. 
Amritpal7, wherein the bench observed that: 
“24. Once the prosecution establishes the 
existence of the three ingredients forming 
a part of “thirdly” in Section 300, it is 
irrelevant whether there was an intention 
on the part of the accused to cause death. 
Further, it does not matter that there was 
no intention even to cause the injury of a 
kind that is sufficient to cause death in 
 
7 (2021) 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

ordinary course of nature. Even the 
knowledge that an act of that kind is likely 
to cause death is not necessary to attract 
“thirdly”.” 
25.14 This Court in the case of Balkar Singh vs. State 
of Uttarakhand8, while following the judgment 
in Virsa Singh (Supra) further elaborated the 
position of law and laid down that culpable 
homicide is murder if two conditions are fulfilled: 
a. the act which caused death is done with the 
intention of causing death or is done with the 
intention of causing a bodily injury; and 
b. the injury intended to be inflicted in sufficient 
in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. 
25.15 The Court in the above-mentioned judgment 
clarified that even if the intention of accused was 
limited to inflicting a bodily injury sufficient to 
cause death in the ordinary course of nature, the 
offence of murder would still be made out. 
25.16 The third clause of Section 300, IPC defines 
murder as the act of causing death by causing 
such bodily injury as is likely to result in death in 
 
8 (2009) 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

the ordinary course of nature. In the present 
case, the appellant’s actions satisfy these criteria. 
The appellant was armed with a knife, which he 
used to inflict multiple injuries on vital organs. 
The fatal nature of these injuries, as confirmed by 
medical evidence, and the circumstances of the 
attack clearly point to an intent to cause death or 
at least an intention to inflict injuries with the 
knowledge that they were likely to result in death. 
Even if it is presumed that the appellant – 
accused no. 1 did not have an intention to cause 
such bodily injury, the act of causing injuries 
with knife to vital parts is reflective of the 
knowledge that causing such injuries is likely to 
cause death in the ordinary course. 
25.17 The defence’s argument that the incident was a 
spontaneous scuffle does not absolve the 
appellant of liability. While the scuffle may have 
triggered the attack, the appellant’s use of a lethal 
weapon and the manner in which the injuries 
were inflicted elevate the act from culpable 
homicide to murder. Courts have consistently 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

held that intent can be inferred from the nature 
and severity of injuries, as well as the choice of 
weapon and the manner of its use. The use of a 
lethal weapon and the deliberate targeting of vital 
parts of the body are strong indicators of such 
intent. 
25.18 In light of the evidence and the legal principles 
involved, the appellant’s plea for leniency on the 
grounds of spontaneity and lack of premeditation 
cannot be sustained. The nature and location of 
the injuries inflicted, the choice of weapon, and 
the circumstances of the attack unequivocally 
establish the liability of the appellant for causing 
the death of Subrahmannian. The argument that 
the act was committed in the spur of the moment 
does not diminish the gravity of the offence or the 
appellant’s culpability. 
2. Plea of Private Defence: The appellant’s counsel 
has invoked the right of private defence arguing 
that the act of stabbing was carried out under a 
perceived threat to the appellant–accused no. 1’s 
life. It is further contended that the appellant 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

exceeded the bounds of lawful defence, thereby 
bringing the act within the ambit of Exception 2 to 
Section 300, IPC, which reads: 
"Culpable homicide is not murder if the 
offender, in the exercise of good faith of the 
right of private defence of person or 
property, exceeds the power given to him 
by law and causes the death of the person 
against whom he is exercising such right." 
 
26.1 To bring the appellant’s act under section 304, 
IPC in light of the offence being committed in 
exercise of private defense and thereby exceeding 
the power given under the law, that is under 
exception 2 to section 300, IPC – the ingredients 
therein must be proved. The ingredients for this 
exception are: 
1. 
The accused must be free from fault in 
bringing about the encounter; 
2. 
There must be an impending peril to life or of 
great bodily harm, either real or apparent; 
3. 
Injuries received by the accused; 
4. 
The injuries caused by the accused; 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

5. 
The accused did not have time or opportunity 
to take recourse to public authorities. 
26.2 This Court in Darshan Singh v. State of 
Punjab9, held that the law provides for the right 
of private defense to citizens to enable them to 
protect 
themselves 
when 
confronted 
with 
imminent danger or unlawful aggression. But 
such protection must not be misused or extend 
beyond the necessities of the case. 
26.3 The counsel for the appellant has argued that the 
appellant acted under a genuine belief of 
impending harm. However, this argument falls 
short upon scrutiny of the injuries sustained by 
the appellant during the altercation. As per the 
wound certificate, the appellant suffered only 
minor injuries: 
i. 
A contusion on the back of the buttock. ii. 
An abrasion over the forehead. 
26.4 The medical evidence confirms that these injuries 
were superficial and did not pose any real or 
 
9 (2010) 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

imminent threat to the appellant’s life or safety. 
The courts below have rightly concluded that the 
appellant’s perception of danger was neither 
reasonable nor proportional to the force he 
employed in response. It is a settled position of 
law that the number of injuries on the accused 
side by itself may not be sufficient to establish 
right of private defense, as has been held by this 
Court in V. Subramani vs. State of Tamil 
Nadu10. But it has further been held that an 
overall view of the case has to be taken to check 
whether a case for private defense is made out 
from the evidence on record. 
26.5 Even if the appellant claims to have acted in 
defense, his role in bringing about the altercation 
cannot be overlooked. The appellant cannot 
benefit from the exception when he was 
instrumental in creating the circumstances that 
led to the confrontation. It has been held in the 
case of Sone Lal vs. State of U.P.11, that when 
 
10 (2005) 
11 (1981) 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

the aggressors, even if they receive injuries from 
the victims of their aggression, cannot have the 
right of private defence. The courts below have 
made a categorical finding that the appellant–
accused no.1 and his co-accused were the 
aggressors in the altercation. The attack was 
initiated by the accused group, who were armed 
with sticks and a knife, with the intent to 
intimidate 
or 
harm 
the 
victim 
and 
his 
companions. This fact is substantiated by the 
testimony of PW-1, an injured eyewitness, who 
described the sequence of events leading up to 
the stabbing. Even if it were assumed that the 
appellant–accused no. 1 acted in self-defense, the 
evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the 
force used was excessive and disproportionate. 
The act of stabbing the deceased multiple times 
in vital organs such as the chest and heart goes 
far beyond what is permissible under the right of 
private defense. 
26.6 As noted in the post-mortem report and 
corroborated by the testimony of PW-6 (the police 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

surgeon), the injuries inflicted on the deceased 
were severe and intentional, including a fatal 
wound to the heart. The appellant’s actions 
cannot be justified as a defensive response to the 
minor injuries he sustained. 
26.7 In light of the above findings, the plea of 
exceeding the right of private defense under 
Exception 2 to Section 300, IPC, is not applicable 
to the appellant’s case. The courts below have 
rightly rejected this argument, holding that the 
appellant was not under any imminent peril and 
that his actions were deliberate and excessive. 
3. Parity with Other Accused Persons: 
27.1 The appellant has further contended that his 
sentence should be reduced on the grounds of 
parity with his co-accused. It is argued that since 
one co-accused had his sentence reduced, and 
another was acquitted by this Court, the 
appellant should be afforded similar leniency. 
The appellant is seeking similar leniency on the 
ground that the circumstances and involvement 
of all accused were substantially similar. 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

27.2 The doctrine of parity ensures fairness in 
sentencing 
when 
co-accused 
persons 
are 
similarly situated and share the same level of 
culpability. However, parity is not an automatic 
entitlement; the role, intent, and actions of each 
accused must be individually assessed to 
determine their degree of involvement in the 
crime. 
27.3 The evidence presented during the trial clearly 
establishes that the appellant played a distinct 
and more culpable role in the incident. While the 
co-accused were armed with sticks and caused 
non-fatal injuries to the victims, the appellant 
alone was armed with a knife and used it to inflict 
fatal injuries on the deceased. The testimony of 
PW-1 reveals that the appellant stabbed the 
deceased after his stick was snatched during the 
altercation. 
This 
sequence 
of 
events 
demonstrates a deliberate escalation by the 
appellant, who resorted to using a deadly weapon 
with the intent to cause grievous harm. 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

27.4 Nothing has been brought on record to show that 
the other accused persons had knowledge of 
appellant being in possession of the knife. Thus, 
there is no evidence to show that the other 
accused persons shared a common intention with 
the appellant to commit murder. The courts 
below have meticulously analyzed the evidence 
and concluded that the co-accused did not share 
a common intention to commit murder. While the 
group acted in concert to assault the victims, the 
fatal 
stabbing 
by 
the 
appellant 
was 
an 
independent and unilateral act. This finding is 
crucial 
in 
distinguishing 
the 
appellant’s 
culpability from that of his co-accused. The 
absence of common intention among the co-
accused precludes the application of vicarious 
liability under Section 34, IPC, for the act of 
murder. 
27.5 The sentence of Accused No. 2 was reduced from 
six years to three years on the grounds that he 
caused only grievous hurt with a stick and did 
not participate in the stabbing and was also 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

unaware of the knife in possession of appellant. 
Accused no.3 was given the benefit of doubt and 
was acquitted due to lack of evidence linking him 
to the assault. 
27.6 The courts have carefully evaluated the evidence 
against each accused and tailored their sentences 
accordingly. The appellant’s argument for parity 
fails to recognize the qualitative differences in 
their roles and the gravity of their actions. The 
appellant’s actions were not only more severe but 
also demonstrated a clear intent to cause death. 
The fatal injuries inflicted on the deceased, as 
detailed in the post-mortem report, leave no room 
for doubt about the appellant – accused no. 1’s 
culpability. The courts below have correctly 
observed that the appellant’s role in the crime is 
incomparable to that of his co-accused. 
27.7 The principle of parity does not apply in the 
present case, as the appellant’s actions were 
materially different from those of his co-accused. 
The sentence imposed on the appellant reflects 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

the gravity of his offense and his individual 
culpability. 
28. Plea of old age and deteriorating health: 
28.1 Another ground taken by the appellant for 
reduction in sentence is that he is a senior citizen 
and has severe health concerns necessitating 
continuous treatment and physiotherapy. This 
Court had once previously granted interim bail to 
the appellant on medical grounds owing to the 
fact that he had suffered a stroke and partial 
paralysis as a result. 
28.2 The Court is cognizant of the appellant's 
advanced 
age 
and 
deteriorating 
medical 
condition, considerations that warrant a humane 
and compassionate approach to justice. These 
factors, when presented in cases of serious 
offences, often invite the judiciary to weigh 
individual circumstances against the broader 
interest of justice. However, the Court is also 
tasked with balancing these personal hardships 
against the severity and nature of the offence, as 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

well as its impact on the rule of law and societal 
harmony. 
 
28.3 In the present case, the appellant has been 
convicted of murder, committed in the course of 
a group attack fueled by political rivalry. The act 
was not one of sudden provocation or impulse but 
arose from a premeditated and collective intent to 
harm the victim, even if the initial intention was 
to cause hurt. The evidence unequivocally 
establishes 
that 
the 
appellant 
actively 
participated in the attack, which culminated in 
the brutal stabbing of the victim in vital parts of 
the body, leading to his death. Such an act, 
carried out with the clear objective to eliminate 
the victim, underscores its heinous nature and 
deliberate execution. 
28.4 While this Court has carefully considered the 
appellant's plea for leniency on account of old age 
and a medical condition, these factors alone 
cannot absolve or mitigate the responsibility for a 
crime of this magnitude. A murder committed 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

with the intent to target vital organs, particularly 
in a group setting, reflects a level of intent and 
cruelty that demands an appropriate punitive 
response. To reduce the sentence in such a case 
would risk undermining the seriousness of the 
crime and the sanctity of life itself, principles that 
the judicial system is duty-bound to uphold. 
28.5 Furthermore, the offence occurred in a context of 
political rivalry, a factor that exacerbates its 
gravity. Crimes rooted in such motives often have 
far-reaching consequences beyond the immediate 
loss of life, contributing to social unrest and 
weakening public confidence in the rule of law. 
The Court must therefore ensure that its 
decisions reinforce the principle of accountability 
and deter the recurrence of such violent acts, 
particularly those that disrupt public order. The 
medical evidence, corroborated by eyewitness 
testimony and the recovery of the weapon, leaves 
no room for doubt. While the Court acknowledges 
the appellant’s advanced age and medical 
condition, these factors cannot outweigh the need 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

for justice and the imperative to uphold the rule 
of law. 
 
28.6 In light of the above, while we empathize with the 
appellant’s personal circumstances, we find no 
compelling justification to interfere with the 
sentence imposed by the lower Court. The nature 
of the offence, its deliberate execution, and its 
societal 
implications 
necessitate 
that 
the 
punishment reflects the seriousness of the crime. 
 
29. Lastly, once conviction under Section 302 of IPC is 
confirmed by all the Courts, then the minimum 
sentence is imprisonment for life, as provided under 
the provision itself. Thus, no ground or reason for 
granting a lesser sentence arises. When the 
minimum sentence itself is life imprisonment, then 
grounds like parity, leniency, old age, health 
concerns, etc. shall not be of any aid to the accused 
while seeking reduction of sentence. Therefore, the 
appellant herein has been granted the minimum 
sentence for committing the offence of murder. 

SLP (CRL.) NO. 4403 OF 2023 

30. After 
thoroughly 
examining 
the 
appellant’s 
submissions and the evidence presented in the 
case, the Court concludes that the appeal against 
conviction and the request for a reduction in 
sentence are without merit. The findings of both the 
Trial Court and the High Court are well-founded 
and supported by compelling evidence. 
31. The courts below have rightly concluded that the 
appellant’s actions amount to murder under 
Section 300, IPC and thus punishable under 
Section 302, IPC. Accordingly, the appeal for 
reduction of the sentence is dismissed. The 
conviction and sentence are upheld.
