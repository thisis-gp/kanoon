CORPORATION & ANR....
APPELLANT(S)
 VERSUS
SMT. SUKANTI MOHAPATRA & ORS....
RESPONDENT(S)
ORDER
Having heard learned counsel for the parties at length, we
are of the view that the impugned judgment passed by the Division
Bench of the High Court, allowing Writ Petition (Civil) nos.
7220/2007 and 8405/2007 filed by respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti
Mohapatra and Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra, is unsustainable, both on
facts and in law.
2.
The appellant before us – Orissa State Financial Corporation1
had granted a loan of Rs.3,26,258.78 (Rupees three lakhs twenty six
thousand two hundred fifty eight and seventy eight paisa only) to
respondent no. 2 - Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra. The loan was payable
in 24 monthly installments commencing from 31.01.1997 and ending on
31.12.1998.
3.
It is an undisputed and accepted position that respondent no.
1 “Corporation”, for short
CA Nos. 743-744/2017

1 – Sukanti Mohapatra had mortgaged a plot bearing no. 359/5975
having area of Ac 0.20 decimals, situated at Mouza-Dhenkanal,
Odisha2, as a security for the said loan.
4.
The loan remained unpaid in spite of several demand notices
issued by the appellant – Corporation. The loan was finally
recalled on 08.11.2002 with Rs.10,91,673.07 (Rupees ten lakhs
ninety one thousand six hundred seventy three and seven paisa only)
remaining due as on 30.06.2002.
5.
It is the case of the appellant – Corporation that the loan
was granted in respect of a vehicle, which had become untraceable.
6.
The appellant – Corporation took steps and seized the
mortgaged immovable property in terms of and as per the provisions
of Section 29 of the State Financial Corporations Act, 19513.
7.
At the same time, respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti Mohapatra
and Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra were given opportunity to pay the loan
amount and/or to settle the dues. At their request, the sale of the
property was deferred.
8.
On 06.01.2004, respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti Mohapatra
and Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra made a request for one time settlement
under the One Time Settlement4 Scheme-20035. The total amount due
and payable by respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti Mohapatra and
Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra, at that time, was Rs.12,20,000/- (Rupees
2 “the mortgaged immovable property”, for short
3 “the Act”, for short
4 “OTS”, for short
5 “first OTS proposal”, for short
CA Nos. 743-744/2017

twelve lakhs twenty thousand only). The OTS application was
rejected on account of failure of respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti
Mohapatra and Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra to deposit the upfront fee.
9. Respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti Mohapatra and Prasanta Kumar
Mohapatra submitted another OTS proposal under OTS Scheme-2004 on
08.09.20046 along with an interim deposit of Rs.16,400/- (Rupees
sixteen thousand four hundred only). However, this OTS proposal was
rejected on the grounds of willful default, and as the vehicle had
been clandestinely sold and transferred. 
10.
However, on the representation of respondent no. 2 - Prasanta
Kumar Mohapatra, the appellant – Corporation made an OTS proposal
under the OTS Scheme-2004 for settlement of dues on payment of
Rs.6,27,400/- (Rupees six lakhs twenty seven thousand four hundred
only), vide a letter dated 31.03.20067. This OTS proposal was
subject to the condition that the entire amount would be paid
within thirty days, that is, on or before 29.04.2006, or
alternatively, 25% of the amount would be paid within two months
and the balance 75% would be paid within six months. Payments were
not made in terms of the said letter/ OTS Scheme-2004. The proposal
lapsed.
11.
The impugned judgment records that respondent no. 2 -
Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra had submitted a representation dated
07.08.2006 for reduction of the OTS amount from Rs.6,27,400/-
(Rupees six lakhs twenty seven thousand four hundred only) to
6 “second OTS proposal”, for short
7 “third OTS proposal”, for short
CA Nos. 743-744/2017

Rs.4,27,000/- (Rupees four lakhs twenty seven thousand only). It is
the case of the appellant – Corporation that they had rejected the
said representation vide letter dated 02.09.2006.
12.
The impugned judgment, in our opinion, erroneously records
that the appellant – Corporation had wrongly rejected the
relaxation, as sought by respondent no. 2 - Prasanta Kumar
Mohapatra in his letter dated 07.08.2006. We have read the contents
of the said letter, but do not find any extraordinary or special
reason as to why the representation deserved acceptance. Further,
whether or not to accept a representation or reduction of the due
amount, was a commercial decision to be taken by the appellant –
Corporation. It is not for the Court to sit in judgment on the
merits over the proposal, unless there were extraordinary facts or
the proposal/offer made by the appellant – Corporation was not in
accordance with the terms of the OTS scheme.8 The latter part was
not pleaded by respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti Mohapatra and
Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra. In our opinion, no such claim is
acceptable. 
13.
On the other hand, we notice that the appellant – Corporation
had substantially reduced the amount, while accepting the third OTS
proposal to settle the dues on payment of Rs.6,27,400/- (Rupees six
lakhs twenty seven thousand four hundred only). Option had also
been given to respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti Mohapatra and
Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra to pay the said amount by depositing 25%
8 See also State Bank of India v. Arvindra Electronics Private Limited, (2023)
CA Nos. 743-744/2017

amount within two months and the balance 75% within six months.
Respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti Mohapatra and Prasanta Kumar
Mohapatra did not avail the concession.
14.
In the aforesaid position, the appellant – Corporation had no
other option but to proceed with the sale. On 14.11.2006, sale
notice of the mortgaged immovable property was issued with the
offset price of Rs.13,15,000 (Rupees thirteen lakhs fifteen
thousand only). 
15.
Letter dated 24.11.2006 was issued to respondent nos. 1 and 2
– Sukanti Mohapatra and Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra to pay the dues of
Rs.21,58,000/- (Rupees twenty one lakhs fifty eight thousand only),
failing which, the appellant - Corporation would proceed with the
sale of the mortgaged immovable property.
16.
On 29.11.2006, the sale was conducted and the mortgaged
immovable property was sold for Rs.13,20,000/- (Rupees thirteen
lakhs twenty thousand only) in favour of respondent no. 3 – Tusar
Ranjan Mishra. The third respondent deposited 25% of the sale
price, that is, Rs.3,30,000/- (Rupees three lakhs thirty thousand
only) on the date of sale itself. The balance sale consideration of
Rs.9,90,000/- (Rupees nine lakhs ninety thousand only) was paid by
respondent no. 3 – Tusar Ranjan Mishra on 05.12.2006.
17.
Respondent no. 2 - Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra had filed Writ
Petition ( before the High Court, seeking
quashing of the sale notice dated 14.11.2006. Another prayer made
CA Nos. 743-744/2017

was that the appellant – Corporation should accept the payment
under the third OTS proposal dated 31.03.2006. On 06.12.2006, the
High Court passed an interim order and directed respondent no. 2 –
Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra to deposit Rs.2,50,000/- (Rupees two lakhs
fifty thousand only) in two weeks. Respondent no 2 – Prasanta Kumar
Mohapatra had thereupon deposited Rs.2,50,000/- (Rupees two lakhs
fifty thousand only). However, the writ petition was heard and
disposed of vide order dated 12.04.2007, observing that in case a
wrong was done in making the sale, the same would be recalled after
giving an opportunity to first respondent – Sukanti Mohapatra to
repay the amount. Application filed for modification of the said
order was disposed of on 03.05.2007, observing that if any flaw or
irregularity is pointed out by respondent no. 2 - Prasanta Kumar
Mohapatra, the same shall also be taken into consideration.
18.
Respondent no. 1 – Sukanti Mohapatra had sent a
representation dated 3.05.2007 to the appellant – Corporation,
challenging the sale. The same was rejected by the appellant –
Corporation by way of a letter dated 21.06.2007.
19.
Respondent no. 1 – Sukanti Mohapatra had filed Writ Petition
(. Interim
order was passed, directing respondent no. 1 – Sukanti Mohapatra to
deposit Rs.4,00,000/- (Rupees four lakhs only) on or before
07.07.2007 and in the event of the deposit being made, physical
possession of the mortgaged immovable property would not be taken
without leave of the Court.
CA Nos. 743-744/2017

20.
The appellant – Corporation returned Rs.2,50,000/- (Rupees
two lakhs fifty thousand only) to respondent no. 1 – Sukanti
Mohapatra on 27.06.2007 and Rs.4,00,000/- (Rupees four lakhs only)
were again paid by respondent no. 1 on 06.07.2007. 
21.
Respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti Mohapatra and Prasanta
Kumar Mohapatra thereafter filed with similar prayers as in.
22.
On 21.10.2008, the transfer/sale deed was executed in favour
of respondent no. 3 – Tusar Ranjan Mishra. It may be noted here
that the appellant – Corporation should not have executed the said
transfer/sale deed in view of the interim orders passed. However,
in our opinion, this does not settle the matter and cannot be a
good ground to dismiss the present appeals. 
23.
The impugned judgment refers to Sections 31 and 32 of the
Act. In our opinion these provisions have no application in the
facts of the present case as the appellant – Corporation has
proceeded in terms of Section 29 of the Act. To this extent, the
impugned judgment is contrary to law and is unsustainable.
24.
Learned counsel for respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti
Mohapatra and Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra has drawn our attention to
the judgment of this Court in Mahesh Chandra v. Regional Manager,
U.P. Financial Corporation & Ors.9 and Kerala Financial Corporation
9 (1993). Referring to the exercise of power of the State Financial 
Corporation under Section 29, this Court observed that- “Keeping these various 
factors giving rise to conflicting interest the following directions are 
necessary to be issued to be observed by the Corporation while exercising power 
CA Nos. 743-744/2017

v. Vincent Paul & Anr.10 
25.
The decision in Mahesh Chandra (supra) has been overruled in
Haryana Financial Corporation & Anr. v. Jagdamba Oil Mills & Anr.11,
in which it has been held that Section 29 gives a right to the
financial corporation inter alia to sell the assets of the
industrial concern and realize the property pledged, mortgaged,
hypothecated or assigned to the financial corporation. This right
accrues when the industrial concern, which is under a liability to
the financial corporation under an agreement, makes any default in
repayment of any loan or advance or any instalment thereof or in
meeting its obligations as envisaged in Section 29 of the Act.
Section 29(1) gives the financial corporation in the event of
default, the right to take over the management, possession or both,
and thereafter, deal with the property. It is observed that the
under Section 29: 
Every endeavour should be made, to make the unit viable and be put on 
working condition. If it becomes unworkable: 
(1) Sale of a unit should always be made by public auction.
(2) Valuation of a unit for purposes of determining adequacy of offer or 
for determining if bid offered was adequate, should always be intimated to the 
unit holder to enable him to file objection if any as he is vitally interested in
getting the maximum price.
(3) If tenders are invited then the highest price on which tender is to be 
accepted must be intimated to the unit holder.
(4)(a) If unit holder is willing to offer the sale price, as the tenderer, 
then he should be offered same facility and unit should be transferred to him. 
And the arrears remaining thereafter should be rescheduled to be recovered in 
instalments with interest after the payment of last instalment fixed under the 
agreement entered into as a result of tendered amount. 
(b) If he brings third parties with higher offer it would be tested and may
be accepted. 
(5) Sale by private negotiation should be permitted only in very large 
concerns where investment runs in very huge amount for which ordinary buyer may 
not be available or the industry itself may be or such nature that by normal 
buyers may not be available. But before taking such steps there should be 
advertisements not only in daily newspapers but business magazines and papers.
(6) Request of the unit holder to release any part of the property on which
the concern is not standing of which he is the owner should normally be granted 
on condition that sale proceeds shall be deposited in loan account.
10 (2011) 
11 (2002) 
CA Nos. 743-744/2017

guidelines issued in Mahesh Chandra (supra), place unnecessary
restrictions on the exercise of power by the financial corporation
contained in Section 29 of the Act, by requiring the defaulting
unit-holder to be associated or consulted at every stage in the
sale of the property. A person who has defaulted is hardly ever
likely to cooperate in the sale of his assets. In fact, the
procedure indicated in Mahesh Chandra (supra) would only result in
a further delay in realization of the dues by the Corporation
through sale of assets. Thus, the observations in Mahesh Chandra
(supra) do not lay down the correct law and was overruled.
26.
The decision in Kerala Financial Corporation (supra) is of a
two-Judge Bench of this Court, whereas the decision in Haryana
Financial Corporation (supra) is a decision of a three-Judge Bench.
The judgment in Kerala Financial Corporation (supra) carries only a
cursory reference to Section 29 of the Act, and has laid down
guidelines for the sale of properties owned by the Kerala Financial
Corporation, in the absence of State specific rules for the same.
The guidelines deal with the aspect of proper valuation of the
property, and do not comment on or prescribe a procedure for other
aspects of the recovery process. In our opinion, this judgment does
not come to the aid of respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti Mohapatra
and Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra, as the appellant – Corporation was
indulgent and has proceeded fairly. Multiple opportunities were
given to respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti Mohapatra and Prasanta
Kumar Mohapatra to repay the loan amount by way of OTS
proposals/offers, as well as written communication through letters.
CA Nos. 743-744/2017

However, respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti Mohapatra and Prasanta
Kumar Mohapatra remained in default, despite benevolent
consideration and concession afforded to them. Sale was made, as a
matter of last resort.
27.
With regard to the sale, we find that respondent nos. 1 and 2
– Sukanti Mohapatra and Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra have not been able
to find a buyer, who could offer a better price than the one which
has been paid by respondent no. 3 – Tusar Ranjan Mishra.
Nevertheless, keeping in view the facts of the present case and to
balance equities inter se the parties, we give an option to
respondent nos. 1 and 2 – Sukanti Mohapatra and Prasanta Kumar
Mohapatra to pay the entire sale consideration of Rs.13,20,000/-
(Rupees thirteen lakhs twenty thousand only) along with the
registration amount and the stamp duty, to respondent no. 3 – Tusar
Ranjan Mishra, with interest at the rate of 18% per annum,
compounded annually, with effect from 01.01.2007 till the date of
payment. This option can be exercised by respondent nos. 1 and 2 –
Sukanti Mohapatra and Prasanta Kumar Mohapatra by making payment,
on or before 31.07.2024. In case the said payment is not made along
with the interest as directed, the appellant – Corporation will be
entitled to take police aid to put respondent no. 3 – Tusar Ranjan
Mishra in possession of the mortgaged immovable property. The
Station House Officer (SHO) of the jurisdictional police station
shall provide necessary aid and assistance for compliance of this
order.
28.
We have passed the aforesaid directions, as it is accepted by
CA Nos. 743-744/2017

the appellant – Corporation and respondent no. 3 – Tusar Ranjan
Mishra that the payment of Rs.13,20,000/- (Rupees thirteen lakhs
twenty thousand only) made by the latter to the former, has been
adjusted in the loan account of respondent no. 2 – Prasanta Kumar
Mohapatra. 
29.
The appeals are disposed of in the above terms. There shall
be no order as to costs.
Pending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of.
