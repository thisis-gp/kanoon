1. 
Leave granted. 
 
2. 
The present appeal before us is a 
judgement passed by the High Court of Telangana on 
22.11.2021 in Writ Appeal 753 of 2019 whereby the 
Division Bench of the High Court has upheld the 
decision of the Single Judge of the High Court dated 
04.09.2019 in W.P.No.45297 of 2018 whereby the 
Appellant’s Writ Petition was dismissed wherein he 
was contesting his retirement from the Respondent 
No.2 Institute which took effect from 14.08.2018 and 

 CA (C) No.8457 of 2022 
the appointment of Respondent No.4 in his place. 
Aggrieved by this, the Appellant is before us. 
 
3. 
The facts of the case are such that the Appellant 
before us was initially appointed as Lecturer in 
Jawaharlal Nehru Technological (JNT) University in 
1985. He was eventually promoted as Reader in 
1995. 
CSI 
Institute 
of 
Technology 
(CSIIT), 
Respondent No.2 issued an advertisement dated 
25.09.1998 for the post of Director. The Appellant 
applied against the said advertisement and was 
selected and appointed as Director vide appointment 
letter dated 26.11.1998. At the time that the 
appointment letter was issued to the Appellant, the 
age of superannuation according to the All India 
Council For Technical Education (AICTE) and 
University Grants Commission (UGC) Regulations 
was sixty years. These regulations were revised vide 
AICTE notification dated 22.01.2010 and UGC 
regulations dated 18.09.2010 wherein the age of 
superannuation for teachers in Technical Institution 
was enhanced to sixty-five years. 
 
4. 
During his stint of Director at CSIIT the appellant 
claims to have been promoted to the post of 
Professor. On 14.08.2018, the Appellant was relieved 
from the post of Director and Respondent No.4 was 
appointed in his place. Two days later, on 

 CA (C) No.8457 of 2022 
16.08.2018, the Appellant made a representation 
praying that he be continued in service until the age 
of sixty-five. Appellant filed of 
2018 before the High Court against the entrustment 
of work to Respondent No.4. The High Court vide 
order dated 02.11.2018 disposed of this Writ Petition 
directing CSIIT to consider and pass orders on 
Appellant’s representation dated 16.08.2018. CSIIT 
in compliance of the order ultimately rejected the 
Appellant’s representation on 03.12.2018. Aggrieved, 
the Appellant filed 
which was dismissed by the Single Judge vide order 
dated 04.09.2019 primarily on the ground that CSIIT 
is affiliated with JNT University which is following 
sixty years to be the age of superannuation and 
therefore the Appellant cannot expect to be continued 
in service up to sixty-five years of age. This order was 
further challenged by the Appellant before the 
Division Bench of the High Court in Writ Appeal 
No.753 of 2019 which was dismissed vide impugned 
order dated 22.11.2021. 
 
5. 
We have heard Shri Gopal Sankaranarayanan, 
learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant 
and learned senior counsels, Shri Vinay Navare and 
Shri J.Prabhakar appearing on behalf of Respondent 
Nos.1 and 2 and learned counsels Shri Ravinder 

 CA (C) No.8457 of 2022 
Agarwal and Shri Harish Pandey appearing for 
Respondent No.3 and Respondent No.6 respectively. 
 
6. The submissions advanced for the Appellant are that 
he has been retired from service on a premature and 
illegal basis as effected by Respondent Nos. 1 and 2. 
It is contended that when the Appellant was 
appointed to the post of Director in the year 1998, his 
age of superannuation was determined as per the 
AICTE and UGC regulations prevailing at that time, 
which was sixty years of age. However, seeing that in 
2010, AICTE and UGC issued amended regulations, 
wherein the age of superannuation was revised up to 
sixty-five years of age, the same benefit should be 
extended to the Appellant now as professional 
institutes 
cannot 
depart 
from 
such 
binding 
regulations. This stand has been corroborated by 
AICTE; Respondent No.6 vide their Counter Affidavit 
as well. To establish that UGC regulations are not 
merely recommendatory, reliance has been placed on 
the following judgements: 
i. 
Islamic Academy of Education and Ors. vs. State 
of Karnataka and Ors1 
ii. 
Sreejith P.S. vs. Rajasree M.S. and Ors2 
iii. 
Kalyani Mathivanan vs. K.V. Jeyaraj and Ors3 
 
1 2003(6) SCC 697 

3 (2015) 

 CA (C) No.8457 of 2022 
iv. 
Janet Jeyapaul vs. SRM University and Ors4 
v. 
T.M.A Pai Foundation and Ors. vs. State of 
Karnataka and Ors5 
 
7. 
On the other hand, it is contended on behalf of 
Respondent Nos.1 and 2 that the Respondent No.2 
Institute is a Private Unaided Minority Educational 
Institution, administered by Respondent No.1, 
Church of South India and affiliated to the State 
University in the State of Telangana. The subsequent 
amendment to the UGC regulations has not been 
adopted by the State of Telangana and the revised age 
of sixty-five years for superannuation does not 
prevail as the norm in the State and in the JNT 
University with which CSIIT is affiliated. 
 
8. 
It is also submitted that the Appellant was never 
involved in teaching and was only working on the 
post of Director with administrative duties and if the 
AICTE regulations were applicable at all, the benefits 
would still not extend to the Appellant as the said 
regulation uses the term “Teacher” and “Principal” 
distinctly which does not apply to the present 
Appellant as he discharged no teaching duties. It is 
further contended that the Appellant was due for 
retirement at the end of February 2018 and until 
 
4 2015 (16) SCC 530 
5 (2002) 

 CA (C) No.8457 of 2022 
August 
2018, 
the 
Appellant 
was 
making 
representations urging that he be given academic 
duties and was negotiating for his retiral benefits. 
This goes to show that the Appellant himself accepted 
his retirement at sixty years of age. 
 
9. 
Having considered the submissions advanced, we do 
not find merit in the contention that merely because 
the UGC and AICTE regulations were subsequently 
amended in 2010 and the age of superannuation for 
teachers in Technical Institutions was increased to 
sixty-five years, the same benefit would automatically 
extend to the Appellant. The Appellant was working 
as Director in CSIIT which is affiliated with JNT 
University which is governed by the laws applicable 
in the State of Telangana. In this case, the 
Government of Andhra Pradesh (now Telangana) has 
decided to not adopt the amendment increasing the 
age 
of 
superannuation 
to 
sixty-five 
in 
their 
universities or colleges vide G.O.Ms.No.40, Higher 
Education & UE-II Department, dated 28.06.2012. 
The Respondent No.2 Institute is a self-financing, 
Minority Educational Institution administered by the 
Respondent No.1 Church of South India, and it is 
neither run nor funded by the Central Government. 
The regulations governing the age of superannuation 
throughout the State, the JNT University and its 
affiliated colleges including CSIIT is sixty years of age 

 CA (C) No.8457 of 2022 
and therefore, when the teachers of JNT University 
are only to continue up to the age of sixty years, the 
Appellant cannot be given special consideration. 
CSIIT is an affiliated Institute of JNT University. Its 
teachers cannot have their age of retirement more 
than that of the teachers of the affiliating University. 
It would create a serious anomaly, discrimination 
and inequality. If the State Government itself has not 
adopted the amended regulations, the same cannot 
be applicable to the CSIIT. Even CSIIT has not 
determined the age of retirement of teachers to be 65 
years. 
 
10. We have also considered the submission that after 
the 
Appellant 
was 
given 
his 
notice 
for 
superannuation, 
he 
continued 
to 
make 
representations for retiral benefits such as leave 
encashment and gratuity etc. This clearly goes to 
show that the Appellant has accepted his retirement 
at the age of sixty. Any other way, the Appellant is 
not a teacher and was only involved in administrative 
work with CSIIT. The Appellant has not led any 
evidence until now to prove that he qualifies as a 
teacher after becoming Director. AICTE and UGC 
regulations are applicable only to those who qualify 
as teachers and are discharging classroom teaching 
duties. 

 CA (C) No.8457 of 2022 
11. Regarding the judgements relied upon by the 
Appellant to establish that the amended UGC 
regulations are not merely recommendatory, we have 
considered them and find those to be distinguishable 
on fact and as such we are not dealing with them. 
 
12. In view of the above and the fact that the Appellant 
has already retired, and Respondent No.4 is 
discharging his duties as Director of Respondent 
No.2 Institute, we find no reason to interfere with the 
impugned judgement passed by the High Court. 
 
13. Accordingly, the present appeal stands dismissed. 
 
14. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
