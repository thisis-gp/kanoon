JUDGEMENT 
 
SURYA KANT, J. 

Delay condoned. 
 
Leave granted. 
2. 
These appeals are preferred by the expropriated landowners 
(hereinafter ‘Appellants’), impugning the judgement dated 
23.08.2022 passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court at 
Chandigarh (hereinafter, ‘High Court’), whereby their appeals 
seeking further enhancement in compensation for their acquired 
lands, have been dismissed. As a necessary corollary, the High 
Court has allowed the cross appeals filed by the Respondent State, 
challenging the enhancement in compensation made by the 
Reference Court. Consequently, the Awards passed by the 
Reference Court have been set aside and the compensation as was 
granted by the Land Acquisition Collector (hereinafter, ‘LAC’) has 
been restored. 
A. FACTS 
3. 
The instant dispute regarding the grant of just and fair 
compensation originated with the issuance of a notification under 
Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter, ‘1894 

9 | P a g e 
 
Act’) on 11.02.2011, for the acquisition of approximately 302.75 
acres of land by the Respondent State. This land, including the 
Appellants’ lands, is situated in the revenue estate of Tauru village 
in Mewat District. The acquisition process was initiated for the 
development and utilisation of land for public purposes, 
specifically for carving out Residential and Utility Areas in Sectors 
7, 8 and 11 in Mewat District under the Haryana Urban 
Development Authority Act, 1977. A notification under Section 6 
of the 1894 Act was thereafter issued on 10.02.2012. 
4. 
The LAC passed the award on 22.10.2013 in respect of the 
land admeasuring 302.75 acres and estimated the compensation 
at Rupees 45,00,000/- per acre, along with 30% solatium and an 
additional amount of 12% per annum for the acquired land. 
Further, 
compensation 
for 
the 
lands 
abutting 
the 
Mohammadpur—Sohna—Tauru bypass road were enhanced by 
20% and 25%, respectively, over the already fixed rate. The LAC 
assessed the compensation primarily based on the rates fixed by 
the Divisional Level Rate Fixation Committee in the following 
manner: (a) 2057 Kanal at Rupees 45,00,000/- per acre; (b) 113 
Kanals and 9 Marlas at Rupees 54,00,000/- per acre; and (c) 251 
Kanals and 11 Marlas at Rupees 56,25,000/- per acre. In addition 

10 | P a g e 
 
to this, the LAC also affixed compensation for building structures 
and trees wherever subsisting on the acquired lands. 
5. 
Aggrieved by the award dated 22.10.2013, the Appellants 
filed Reference(s) under Section 18 of the 1894 Act before the 
Additional District Judge, Mewat (hereinafter, ‘Reference Court’). 
The Reference Court, vide separate awards, enhanced the market 
value of the acquired land to Rupees 92,62,500/- per acre, in 
addition to granting other statutory benefits. The Reference Court, 
in this instance, relied upon a sale exemplar, Ex. P76, to assess 
the market value of the acquired land as on the date of the 
issuance of Section 4 notification, and subsequently increased the 
compensation amount. Both the Appellants and the Respondent, 
being dissatisfied with the decision of the Reference Court, 
preferred appeals before the High Court. 
6. 
In this vein, the High Court allowed the appeals preferred by 
the Respondent State while dismissing those filed by the 
Appellants. The High Court held that the Reference Court had 
incorrectly estimated the market value and enhanced the 
compensation as it ignored various sale instances of comparable 
parcels of land that had been produced by the Respondents. 
Additionally, the High Court also doubted the reliability of Ex. P76, 

11 | P a g e 
 
which was the basis of the Reference Court’s decision, on the 
ground that this sale deed belonged to a commercial plot of land 
and was post the notification issued under Section 4 of the 1894 
Act. Accordingly, the High Court set aside the award(s) of the 
Reference Court and reverted the compensation amount to that 
initially granted by the LAC. Hence, these appeals. 
B. CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES 
7. 
We have heard Learned Senior Counsel for the parties at a 
considerable length and meticulously perused the documents 
submitted on record. 
8. 
S/Shri Narender Hooda, Sunil Dalal and Gagan Gupta, 
Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants, first 
demonstrated the potentiality of the acquired land. They 
contended that the High Court had overlooked the fact that the 
acquired lands fell squarely within the municipal limits of Tauru 
city and were surrounded by civic amenities such as a Bus Stand, 
Hospital, School, College, a Power Station and Industrial as well 
as Residential establishments. They further asserted that the 
acquired land was located on the Sohna-Tauru bypass and was in 
close proximity to the Gurgaon-National Capital Region, as also 
the Industrial Township established at Bhiwadi, Rajasthan. 

12 | P a g e 
 
Additionally, the land is situated between the Sohna—Rewari 
metal road on one side and the KMP Highway on the other. This 
strategic location, they argued, indicated that the market value of 
the acquired land, having immense potential at the time of 
acquisition, could not have been valued at less than Rupees 
5,00,00,000/- per acre. 
9. 
It was contended that the sale exemplars, particularly Ex. 
RW1/D and RW1/F, which have been relied upon by the LAC and 
the High Court while assessing the rate of compensation at Rupees 
45,00,000/- per acre, appertained to the smaller pieces of land and 
were inferior in nature, as the sale consideration mentioned 
therein was lower than the rate estimated by the LAC itself. 
Instead, they urged that Ex. P76 and Ex. P3 ought to have been 
relied upon, owing to their similarity and proximity to the acquired 
land, as well as their temporal proximity to the date of issuance of 
the Section 4 notification. They further emphasised that these sale 
exemplars are the best sale instances to be considered since Ex. 
P76 was registered only a few months after the Section 4 
notification, whereas Ex. P3 was executed prior to the said 
notification. 

13 | P a g e 
 
10. Given what had been adduced, Learned Senior Counsels 
relied on a plethora of decisions in support of their arguments, 
including the judgment of this Court in Dollar Co. v. Collector of 
Madras,1 wherein it was held that a sale deed of a recent date 
could be considered the best evidence. Additionally, they placed 
reliance on the decision in Special Land Acquisition Officer and 
another v. M.K. Rafiq Saheb,2 where this Court held that sale 
deeds pertaining to smaller areas could be taken into 
consideration by applying a cut. 
11. Conversely, Mr. Vikramjit Bannerjee, learned Additional 
Solicitor General of India, representing the Respondents, 
contended that the sale deeds produced by the Appellants could 
not be relied upon as they pertained to sale instances of tiny plots 
of land constituting only a few Marlas. More specifically, he argued 
that Ex. P3 was not reliable since it measured only 1 Kanal and 
10.5 Marlas, making it significantly smaller in comparison to the 
acquired land. Similarly, with respect to Ex. P76, which was also 
heavily relied upon by the Appellants, he asserted that it ought to 
be discarded, not only because it was subsequent to the Section 4 
 
 SC 1670. 
2 (2011). 

14 | P a g e 
 
notification but also since the land therein was purchased for a 
commercial purpose by a private company for warehousing, and 
thus would not accurately reflect the market value of the acquired 
land. 
12. Instead, Mr. Bannerjee urged that the sale instances placed 
on record by the Respondents should be relied upon despite having 
been recorded post the Section 4 notification, as they lend proper 
guidance for estimating the market value of the acquired land on 
the crucial date of 11.02.2021. Lastly, he asserted that even if the 
Court were to consider the sale instance of a smaller parcel of land, 
only those sale exemplars where the land has been used towards 
developmental purposes should be relied upon, and after applying 
the appropriate deduction towards development charges. 
C. ISSUES 
13. Having considered the factual background out of which the 
dispute has arisen and the contentions put forth, the questions 
that fall for our deliberation are set out as follows: 
i. 
Whether the Appellants are entitled to higher rate of 
compensation and if so, to what extent; and 

15 | P a g e 
 
ii. 
How should the quantum of such compensation be 
calculated? 
D. ANALYSIS 
14. As already elucidated in the facts of this case, there has been 
a significant difference in the evaluations conducted by the 
Reference Court and, subsequently, the High Court. The High 
Court has reduced the valuation affixed by the Reference Court by 
half and, instead, restored the compensation amount granted by 
the LAC. Given the differences in the approaches adopted by these 
courts and the variation in outcomes faced by the Appellants, it 
becomes imperative for us to assess the evidence placed on record 
by both parties and determine whether sufficient grounds subsist 
for us to enhance the compensation so awarded. 
15. In this regard, it would be appropriate to refer to the table 
prepared by the High Court, which, in its decision, has aptly 
summarised the different evidence produced by the parties as

16. Upon further examination of the details of this table, it seems 
to us that these exemplars can be classified in the following 
manner: (a) sale instances executed prior to the issuance of 
Section 4 notification; and (b) sales instances executed after the 
issuance of the Section 4 notification. Thereupon, we have taken 
the liberty of further representing this recalibrated categorisation

17. Having distinguished between the two sets of sale instances 
executed before and after the issuance of the Section 4 notification, 
we would now proceed to determine whether the Appellants are 
entitled to compensation at a rate higher than the one determined 
by the High Court. 
18. The process of assessing or affixing compensation is not 
tethered to precision but is rather aimed at a nuanced estimation 
of pertinent factors. This task is governed by Section 23(1) of the 
Land Acquisition Act of 1894, which mandates that, in 
determining compensation for acquired land, the Court must 
consider the ‘market value’ of the land as of the ‘date of publication 
of the notification under Section 4’. The ‘market value’ is to be 
assessed with reference to factors such as standing crops and 
trees, the severance of part of the land, damage to movable or 
immovable property or earnings, the need to relocate one’s 
residence or business, and any loss of profits from the land 
between the publication of the declaration under Section 6 and the 
Collector's assumption of possession. 
19. This Court has through various judicial precedents, 
including a three-judge bench decision in Special Land 

19 | P a g e 
 
Acquisition Officer v. T. Adinarayan Setty,3 held that the 
‘market value’ connotes the price that a willing buyer would pay to 
a willing seller, taking into account the land’s current conditions 
and its advantages and potentialities. For this, typically, the best 
approach is the comparable sales method, under which the bona 
fide sale exemplars of similar lands are relied upon to ascertain 
the market value of the land under acquisition. However, to ensure 
that the valuation is just and proper, this Court has explained that 
such sale exemplars must satisfy certain criteria, including that: 
(a) the sale must be a genuine transaction; (b) the sale deed must 
have been executed around the time of the Section 4 notification; 
(c) the land must be situated near the acquired land; (d) the nature 
of the land covered in the sale instance must be similar to the 
acquired land; and (e) the size of the plot covered by the sale 
instance should be comparable to the land acquired.4 
20. Apart from satisfying these factors, it is also imperative that 
the sale exemplars reflect the price of the land on the ‘date of 
publication of the notification under Section 4’. On account of this 
express condition, there are numerous instances where this Court 
 
 SC 429. 
4 Shaji Kuriakose v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., (2001). 

20 | P a g e 
 
has laid down that the sale exemplars executed after the Section 4 
notification should not ordinarily be relied upon.5 This is grounded 
in the reasoning that once the acquisition process begins, it can 
impact the valuation of the land, rendering subsequent sale 
exemplars to be potentially inaccurate reflections of the true 
valuation of the acquired land. This principle was cogently 
addressed by this Court in A. Natesam Pillai v. Tahsildar,6 
which held that the commencement of acquisition often leads to 
an increase in the market values of adjacent lands, thereby 
discrediting post-notification transactions as reliable indicators of 
the acquired land’s value. 
21. Having been equipped with the factors to be considered while 
selecting a comparable sale instance to draw an estimate from, it 
is perhaps suitable to tackle the core issue and ascertain which of 
the sale exemplars produced before us may be most appropriate to 
be utilised in this exercise. 
22. In the case at hand, the High Court and the Reference Court 
have disagreed on what sale exemplars could be used to determine 
fair compensation. While the Reference Court relied on Ex P76, the 
 
5 General Manager, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. Rameshbhai Jivanbhai Patel, 
2008 (14) SCC 745; Maya Devi v. State of Haryana, (2018). 
6 (2010). 

21 | P a g e 
 
High Court has rejected the same because it was executed after 
the issuance of the Section 4 notification. Nevertheless, the High 
Court has fallen prey to the same error and has relied upon the 
Respondents’ sale exemplars, which were also executed after the 
acquisition had already begun. 
23. As discussed above, post-notification sales can only be 
considered when better evidence is not available on record and 
when the party relying on it can convincingly demonstrate that 
there has been no upward trend in market prices due to the 
acquisition.7 Consequently, in light of this analysis, the sale deeds 
numbered P9, P76, R15 and RW1/C-H, which were executed after 
the date of the issuance of the Section 4 notification, will invariably 
have to be excluded from any further consideration, save and 
except for exceptional and compelling circumstances. 
24. Apart from these sale deeds that were not proximate 
temporally, we also deem it appropriate to exclude the sale deeds 
that are not comparable geographically. It is now a firmly 
entrenched principle of law that, in the ordinary course, sale 
exemplars of lands located in the surrounding villages should 
 
7 Karan Singh v. Union of India, (1997) l; Rishi Pal Singh v. Meerut Development 
Authority, (2006). 

22 | P a g e 
 
generally not be relied upon, as land valuation may vary 
significantly by locality. In the landmark decision of Kanwar 
Singh v. Union of India,8 this Court held that sale exemplars of 
lands situated in an adjacent village cannot be used to determine 
the market value of the acquired land since such lands may differ 
in terms of quality and other attributes. On this ground, the sale 
deeds enumerated Ex. R8 to Ex. R16 and Ex. R18 shall also have 
to be excluded from consideration, as they pertain to a different 
village, namely Gwarka, whereas the acquired land is situated in 
village Tauru. 
25. In light of the exclusions made thus far, we are presently left 
with sale deeds numbered Ex. P2 to Ex. P8 and Ex. P10. In this 
context, the Respondents have sought to argue that considering 
the total area of the land in these sale deeds being very small in 
size, they are also liable to be discarded. True it is, that such sale 
deeds ought not to directly form the basis for determining the rate 
at which compensation is to be awarded. Indeed, a thorough review 
of relevant precedents in this backdrop does reveal that smaller 
parcels of land conventionally command higher prices. Relying on 
 
8 (1998). 

23 | P a g e 
 
such sale exemplars also, especially when only single solitary such 
instances are presented, may thus not be appropriate.9 
26. However, there is no bar in law against considering sale 
exemplars of smaller plots, provided they are subjected to 
adequate developmental charges. The rationale behind applying 
such cuts lies in the fact that smaller plots often command higher 
prices due to their developed nature, whereas a larger tract of land 
which is acquired for development may require significant 
allocation for creating roads, parks, essential services, etc.10 
Accordingly, these sale exemplars can be relied upon only after 
applying 
appropriate 
cuts. 
This 
Court 
in 
Chimanlal 
Hargovinddas v. LAO,11 authoritatively ruled that when valuing a 
large block of land, appropriate deduction must be made for setting 
aside areas for roads, open spaces and dividing the land into 
smaller plots suitable for the construction of buildings. 
27. In the instant case, there are multiple sale deeds of smaller 
plots, and these represent the best available evidence for 
estimating compensation. Since there is no legal impediment to 
considering such sale deeds, the logical progression in the 
 
9 Administrator General of West Bengal v. Collector, Varanasi, (1988). 
10 Ibid; Atma Singh v. State of Haryana and others, (2008). 
11 (1988). 

24 | P a g e 
 
compensation estimation process would be to identify the most 
suitable sale deed(s) for determining the market value and 
subsequently, to apply adequate deductions on the same. The 
solution to this state of flux may thus be found in the case of 
Mehrawal Khewaji Trust v. State of Punjab,12 where this Court 
laid down as follows: 
“...It is clear that when there are several 
exemplars with reference to similar lands, it is 
the general rule that the highest of the 
exemplars, if it is satisfied that it is a bona fide 
transaction, 
has 
to 
be 
considered 
and 
accepted. When 
the 
land 
is 
being 
compulsorily taken away from a person, he 
is entitled to the highest value which 
similar land in the locality is shown to have 
fetched in a bona fide transaction entered 
into between a willing purchaser and a 
willing seller near about the time of the 
acquisition.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
28. This view has been reiterated in Sh. Himmat Singh v. State 
of M.P.,13 where a three-judge bench of this Court consolidated 
various precedents to affirm that in circumstances where there are 
multiple sale deeds available for consideration, the Court shall rely 
on the highest valued exemplars unless the prices fall within a 
 
12 (2012). 
13 (2013). 

25 | P a g e 
 
narrow range, in which case calculating an average of the values 
therein may be more congruous. 
29. In these extenuating circumstances, there exists significant 
disparity among the sale exemplars presently under consideration. 
Amongst these sale exemplars, being Ex. P2-P8 and Ex. P10, the 
highest sale instance values the land at Rupees 1,81,33,867 per 
acre, whereas the lowest values it at Rupees 16,94,000 per acre. 
Given this wide range and in light of the judicial precedents cited 
above, we are of the opinion that we should rely upon the highest 
sale exemplar, which is Ex. P5, rather than solely depending upon 
an average of the multiple sale deeds produced before us. Despite 
the Respondents’ vehement contention that Ex. P5 should not be 
relied upon owing to it being a significantly smaller parcel of land—
the detailed analysis conducted above indicates no reason why Ex. 
P5 cannot be utilised to determine the amount of compensation to 
be awarded to the Appellants for the acquired land. 
30. Thus, having established the sale exemplar being relied upon 
and consequentially the base price to be Rupees 1,81,33,867 per 
acre, we now proceed to the aspect of deductions to be applied to 
the amount so determined. In this regard, there is no hard and fast 
rule on the amount of deduction to be applied towards 

26 | P a g e 
 
development charges. Instead, such deductions may, for the 
purpose of making a small area of land comparable to larger tracts, 
range from a minimum of 20% to a maximum of 75%.14 
31. Since the degree of application of cuts is essentially a 
question of fact dependent on the unique circumstances of each 
case, the particulars to be reckoned with in determining the extent 
of such deduction often include a myriad of factors, such as the 
relative difference in the size of the land in the sale exemplar vis a 
vis the acquired land, proximity to a road, nearness to developed 
areas, etc.15 Additionally, several decisions have also taken into 
account the nature of the lands because of the stark difference that 
may exist between the valuation of an agricultural or undeveloped 
land and the sale price of a small developed plot in a private 
layout.16 
32. Circling back to the facts of the present case, it is evident that 
the land in Ex. P5 is similar in nature to the acquired land, both 
being agricultural land. Its proximity to the acquired land and the 
fact that it is situated in the same village of Tauru, are relevant 
 
14 Balwan Singh v. State of Haryana and others, 2022 SCC Online SC 637; Chandrashekar 
v. LAO, (2012).

16 Ibid. 

27 | P a g e 
 
when determining the extent of deductions to be applied in 
calculating the compensation to be granted to the Appellants. 
Additionally, what is also of utmost importance is that the value of 
the land is corroborated by surrounding circumstances, which 
point towards its potentiality. Although Ex. P76 cannot be relied 
upon since it was executed after the Section 4 notification, it 
nonetheless reflects the land’s potential for being used other than 
for agricultural purposes. Moreover, the acquired land’s strategic 
location near the Bus Stand, Grain Market and Main Bazaar, 
besides being located near Palwal-Sohna-Rewari State Highway, as 
well as its proximity to the Industrial Township at Bhiwadi, and 
nearby schools and colleges, further supports the assertion that 
the land possesses immense potentiality. 
33. On the face of these distinctive factors lies the challenge of 
ascertaining the appropriate extent of deduction to be made. As 
already established, judicial precedents dictate that the amount of 
deduction to be applied towards developmental charges can range 
from anywhere between 20% to 75%. On the one hand, we must 
acknowledge and recognise the stark disparity between the size of 
the land covered by the sale exemplar and the acquired land. On 
the other hand, it is incumbent that we take note of the various 

28 | P a g e 
 
advantageous factors associated with the acquired land at the time 
of issuance of the Section 4 notification. A balanced approach in 
adjudicating this particular issue is therefore necessary. 
Considering these militating aspects, we cannot justify applying 
deduction at either extreme end of the spectrum. A prudent course 
of action might be to steer a middle path, aiming for a range 
approximately between 46% to 50%. 
34. Having said that, even if we were to apply the higher end of 
deductions from this middle course, at 50%, the compensation to 
be granted to the Appellants would still surpass the amount 
initially determined by the LAC and would in fact, be closer in 
range to the rate granted by the Reference Court. 
35. Alternatively, and only to bolster our above arrived 
conclusion, even if the principle of averaging were applied, the 
most suitable sale instances for this purpose, as discussed earlier, 
would be Ex. P2 to Ex. P8 and Ex. P10, which are noted to be in 
close proximity to the acquired land. Upon evaluation, the average 
price of these lands is Rupees 1,49,71,733 per acre, which exceeds 
the sale consideration shown in most comparable sale examples. 
This leaves no room for doubt that the compensation awarded by 
the Reference Court, at the rate of Rupees 92,62,500 per acre, was 

29 | P a g e 
 
neither excessive nor beyond the fair and just value of the acquired 
land. 
36. However, considering the totality of the circumstances and 
recognizing that the subject land has not been acquired for 
profiteering or commercial purposes, but primarily for the 
development of a residential area, we find it appropriate to rely on 
the valuation reflected in the best exemplar, Ex. P/5, as a fair and 
reasonable basis for compensation. 
37. Thus, upon careful consideration, we are of the considered 
opinion that the High Court erred in reducing the valuation of the 
land and affirming the figures granted by the LAC. As 
demonstrated by our analysis above, the evaluation conducted by 
the Reference Court was nearly accurate and aligned with the 
evidence of the sale deeds and potentiality, despite the fact that 
the sale exemplar Ex. P76, on which it relied upon, may not have 
been ideal, given the circumstances and its commercial nature. 
E. CONCLUSION 
38. For the reasons stated above, these appeals are allowed, the 
impugned leading judgment dated 23.08.2022 of the High Court, 
as well as all other judgments following the said leading judgment 

30 | P a g e 
 
which are under challenge in this batch of appeals, are hereby set 
aside, and the compensation amount granted by the Reference 
Court is hereby restored. 
39. The compensation amount, if already not paid, wholly or 
partly, as per the award of the Reference Court, shall be paid to 
the Appellants and other land-owners along with all the statutory 
benefits including interest, within eight weeks. 
40. All the matters stand disposed of in the aforementioned 
terms.
