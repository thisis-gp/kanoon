JUDGMENT 

AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. 
1. In the present Appeals challenge is to the 
Judgment dated 14.02.2022 passed by the 
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, 
Principal Bench, New Delhi (hereinafter referred 
to as “NCLAT”) which were preferred by the 
Appellant, i.e., NOIDA Special Economic Zone 
Authority, 
being 
the 
Operational 
Creditor 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

(hereinafter referred to as “Appellant”) impugning 
the Order dated 05.10.2020 passed by the 
Adjudicating Authority of National Company Law 
Tribunal, New Delhi Bench (hereinafter referred 
to as “NCLT”) approving the Resolution Plan as 
presented on the approval by the Committee of 
Creditors, and also the Order dated 27.11.2020 
vide which an application preferred by the 
Appellant, challenging the approval of the 
Resolution Plan, stood rejected. 
2. Briefly, the facts are that the Respondent No.02, 
i.e., Shree Bhoomika International Limited, being 
the Corporate Debtor (hereinafter referred to as 
“Corporate Debtor”) was sub-leased the Plot 
bearing No. 59-I admeasuring 16,100 square 
meters at NOIDA Special Economic Zone 
(hereinafter referred to as “NSEZ”) by the 
Appellant, in capacity of lessee of the said land 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

from the NOIDA Authority, vide Lease Deed 
dated 26.10.1995, and it was valid for a period of 
15 years, i.e., up to 31.05.2010. It is the case of 
the Appellant that the Corporate Debtor had 
begun defaulting on lease payments in 1999, and 
moreover, there was no performance or activity 
on the said land since the year 2003-2004 
leading to financial losses to the Government 
Exchequer, and same also being violative of the 
Special Economic Zone Rules and guidelines 
framed therein. Appellant has also made a 
reference to a Public Notice dated 06.02.2018 by 
the Stressed Assets Stabilization Fund for sale of 
immovable and movable assets of the Corporate 
Debtor through an e-auction, fixing the total 
reserved price at INR 09.18 Crores. 
3. In the light of the defaults committed by the 
Corporate 
Debtor, 
Corporate 
Insolvency 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

Resolution Process (hereinafter referred to as 
“CIRP”) was initiated by the Appellant before the 
NCLT. While admitting the said application on 
11.07.2019, an Interim Resolution Professional 
(hereinafter referred to as “IRP”) was appointed. 
The Committee of Creditors, which comprised of 
the Sole Financial Creditor, being the Stressed 
Assets Stabilization Fund – IDBI Bank Limited 
(hereinafter referred to as “sole Financial 
Creditor”) was constituted by the IRP after 
making a public announcement on 17.07.2019 
as per the prescribed procedure. 
4. In pursuance thereto, the Appellant filed a claim 
of INR 6,29,18,121/- (Rupees Six Crores Twenty 
Nine Lakhs Eighteen Thousand and One 
Hundred Twenty One only) which was admitted 
by 
the 
Respondent 
No.01 
– 
Resolution 
Professional (hereinafter referred to as “RP”) in 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

entirety. Valuation of the Corporate Debtor was 
thereby conducted by two different valuers, and 
an average thereof was carried out, leading to the 
fixing of the liquidation value of the Corporate 
Debtor at INR 04.25 Crores. The Appellant had 
put forth that the valuers had also observed that 
the valuations derived by them could be realised, 
subject to fulfilment of the rules of NSEZ and 
procedure of approval thereof. 
5. The 
Resolution 
Plan 
dated 
24.11.2019 
(hereinafter referred to as “Resolution Plan”), 
which was prepared by the Respondent No. 03 – 
M/s Commodities Trading, being the Resolution 
Applicant (hereinafter referred to as “Resolution 
Applicant”) was put before the Committee of 
Creditors, which approved it in its 4th Meeting 
dated 06.01.2020. 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

6. An application was then filed under Sections 
31(1) and 60(5) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy 
Code, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as “IBC 
2016”) before the NCLT by the RP, seeking an 
approval of the Resolution Plan on behalf of the 
Committee of Creditors. The same was allowed 
by NCLT vide Order dated 05.10.2020, granting 
only INR 50 Lakhs to the Appellant against its 
admitted claim of INR 06.29 Crores. Aggrieved, 
the Appellant put forth its objections before the 
RP to the Resolution Plan and claimed payment 
of the entire amount of INR 06.29 Crores from 
the Corporate Debtor, leaving open the legal 
remedy to recover the full dues, in case the same 
was not accepted. 
7. Being at loggerhead with the RP with respect to 
the payment of admitted claim, the Appellant 
moved 
an 
application 
before 
the 
NCLT 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

challenging the Order dated 05.10.2020, which 
approved 
the 
Resolution 
Plan. 
This 
was 
dismissed 
vide 
Order 
dated 
27.11.2020, 
observing that the said tribunal did not have the 
jurisdiction to accept the prayer made in the 
application, which would amount to setting aside 
of the Resolution Plan, and the Appellant had the 
remedy of filing an appeal before the NCLAT. 
8. Thereafter, the Appellant moved appeals under 
Section 61 of IBC 2016 before the NCLAT, 
challenging both the orders, as referred to above. 
These appeals were also dismissed vide the 
impugned Judgment dated 14.02.2022. 
9. The grievance put forth by the Appellant is with 
regard to the Appellant not being informed about 
the auction proceedings which were initiated at 
behest of the RP, thus, depriving it of its 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

participation in the said proceedings. Once the 
total claim had been admitted by the RP, which 
was clearly indicated in the Resolution Plan, the 
said amount should have been disbursed to the 
Appellant prior to the claim of the other 
claimants, including the sole Financial Creditor. 
10. Another aspect which has been pressed into 
service is with regard to Clause 10.9 of the 
Resolution Plan, as regards the exemptions from 
the NSEZ, asserted to be in direct contravention 
and contradiction to their established rules and 
principles of the functioning of the NSEZ. The 
Appellant, which works under the guidance of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Commerce 
and 
Industry, 
Government of India, could not have been 
commanded relating to its functions by the RP, 
especially with regard to the charges or penalties 
relatable to the change in any business model for 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

transfer of units by the original allottee. The 
attempt to by-pass the payment of statutory fee 
would be an unjust enrichment to the Resolution 
Applicant, thus, contradicting Section 34(2)(d) of 
the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 (hereinafter 
referred to as “SEZ Act, 2005”). 
11. The Appellant even challenged the fair and 
liquidation valuation of the Corporate Debtor 
being conducted by the two valuers. It was so 
challenged on the ground that no physical 
inspection of the property in question was carried 
out by the said valuers. A reference in this regard 
was made to Regulation 35(1)(a) of Insolvency 
and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency 
Resolution 
Process 
for 
Corporate 
Persons) 
Regulations 2016 (hereinafter referred to as “IBBI 
Regulations 2016”), which required physical 
verification of the Corporate Debtor. 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

12. At the cost of reiteration, the Appellant invariably 
pressed over and over again assignment of only 
INR 50 Lakhs as against the admitted claim of 
INR 6,29,18,121/- (Rupees Six Crores Twenty 
Nine Lakhs Eighteen Thousand and One 
Hundred Twenty One only). 
13. The learned Senior Advocate appearing for the 
Appellant 
has 
vehemently 
put 
forth 
the 
submissions as recorded above and has also 
referred to the statutory provisions before this 
Court. On considering the same, going through 
the impugned judgment dated 14.02.2022 
passed by the NCLAT and the records, we are not 
persuaded to take a different view. 
14. As regard the fair value and liquidation value of 
Corporate Debtor, as derived by the valuers is 
concerned, this Court in Duncans Industries 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

Ltd. v. State of U.P. and Others1 held that the 
question of valuation is basically a question of 
facts, which does not call for any interference if 
it is based on relevant material on record. As 
stated above, the average of the two closest 
estimates given by the valuers were taken into 
consideration as fair value and liquidation value 
respectively, which were found to be just and 
reasonable. This would be, keeping in view 
Section 35C of IBC 2016, where the powers and 
duties of the liquidator have been laid down. 
Since due process appears to have been followed 
no fault is found requiring interference. 
15. Sections 30 and 31 of IBC 2016, which deal with 
the submission of the Resolution Plan has rightly 
been evaluated and analysed NCLAT as per the 
 
1 (2000) 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

ratio laid down by this Court in Maharashtra 
Seamless 
Limited 
v. 
Padmanabhan 
Venkatesh and Others2, Ghanashyam Mishra 
and Sons Private Limited v. Edelweiss Asset 
Reconstruction 
Company 
Limited 
and 
Others3, and K. Sashidhar v. Indian Overseas 
Bank and Others4, reference thereof has been 
made by the NCLAT in extenso. Conclusion as 
culled out and elucidated is correct that all the 
dues, including statutory dues owned by the 
Central Government, State Government and 
local authority, which is not the part of the 
Resolution Plan shall stand extinguished and no 
proceedings in respect of such dues for the period 
prior to the date on which the Adjudicating 
Authority had approved the Resolution Plan 
 
2 (2020) 
3 (2021) 
4 (2019) 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

could be pressed into service or continues. These 
observations took care of the assertions of the 
Appellant with regard to the statutory dues and 
the claims as have been made and put forth 
relatable to the areas of lease. 
16. Beside this, as regards the other claims 
pertaining to the transfer fees, etc. were not to be 
interfered with by courts or tribunals as the same 
stood related to the commercial wisdom of the 
Committee of Creditors for they being the best 
persons to determine their interests, and any 
such interference is non-justiciable except as 
provided by Section 30(2) of IBC 2016. We do not 
find violation of the statute or the procedure as 
also the norms fixed as per the decisions referred 
to above of this Court, the Resolution Plan as 
approved by the Committee of Creditors, and the 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

same having been accepted deserves and has 
rightly been left untouched. 
Fundamentally, the financial decisions as have 
been taken by Committee of Creditors, especially 
with regard to viability or otherwise, while 
evaluating the plan would thus prevail. 
17. As far as the submission of the Learned Senior 
Counsel that exemptions from NSEZ payments, 
including any type of fees or penalty for renewal 
of sub-lease and/or for transfer charges due with 
regard 
to 
the 
change 
of 
directorship 
or 
shareholding 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
Resolution 
Applicant has to be dealt with as per Clause 10.9 
of the Resolution Plan cannot be accepted in the 
light of Section 238 of IBC 2016, which provides 
for the provisions of IBC 2016 to have an 
overriding effect over the other laws. If that be so, 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

the obvious effect is that the same would prevail, 
leading to the provisions as contained in the SEZ 
Act 2005 giving way to IBC 2016. 
18. It has come on record and stands admitted that 
the 
Resolution 
Plan 
had 
already 
been 
implemented and the dues as found payable 
under the Resolution Plan have been disbursed 
to the concerned parties. As regards the 
Appellant 
is 
concerned, 
the 
amount 
was 
disbursed vide Demand Draft dated 22.10.2020 
which has been received and accepted by the 
Appellant. Leading to the dismissal of the appeal 
vide impugned Judgment dated 14.02.2022. 
19. In the light of above and having perused the 
record while bearing in mind the extensive 
observations made by 3-Judge Bench of this 
Court in Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

India Limited v. Satish Kumar Gupta and 
Others5, and its reiteration by numerous 
subsequent decisions of this Court such as the 
Ebix Singapore Private Limited v. Committee 
of Creditors of Educomp Solutions Limited 
and Another6 and in the latest decision in DBS 
Bank Limited Singapore v. Ruchi Soya 
Industries Limited and Another7, we find 
ourselves not in a position to accept the claim of 
the Appellant as sought to be made and put forth 
in these appeals. 
20. The Orders dated 05.10.2020 and 27.11.2020, 
as have been passed by the NCLT and approved 
by the NCLAT vide its impugned Judgment dated 
14.02.2022, do not call for any interference in the 
 
5 (2020) 
6 (2022) 
7 (2024) 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5918-19 of 2022 

present Appeals. The appeals being devoid of 
merit, stand dismissed. 
21. There shall be no order as to costs. 
22. Pending application(s), if any, also stand 
disposed of....………………………………. J.
