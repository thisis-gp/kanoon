IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA 
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
 
ADV BABASAHEB WASADE 
& ORS. 

 VERSUS 

MANOHAR GANGADHAR 
MUDDESHWAR & ORS. 

JUDGMENT 
 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 
 
1. The present appeal assails the correctness of the 
judgment and order dated 20.07.2017, passed by 
the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court in 
First Appeal No. 811 of 2016, whereby the Appeal 
was dismissed, thereby confirming the order 
passed by the District Judge-IV, Chandrapur 
which confirmed the order passed by the 

Assistant 
Charity 
Commissioner, 
Nagpur 
rejecting 
the 
change 
report 
filed 
by 
the 
appellants. 
 
2. There is a society by the name of Shikshan 
Prasarak Mandal, Mul1 registered under the 
Societies Registration Act, 18602 as a charitable 
society since 1946. The Society in its turn framed 
its rules and regulations. Later on, the Society 
was registered as a Public Trust under the 
Bombay Public Trusts Act, 19503. The rules and 
regulations of the Society were incorporated as 
its bye-laws and were duly registered under the 
Trusts Act. 
 
3. As per the rules and regulations, the Society has 
four types of members i.e. Life members, 
 
1 In short, “Society” 
2 In short, Registration Act” 
3 In short, “Trusts Act” 

Employee members, Ordinary members and 
Donor members. The members of each category 
were required to pay an annual membership 
subscription of Rs. 11/- per year to the Society. 
 
4. The effective office bearers of the Society namely 
the President, Vice-President and the Secretary 
of the Society expired. Even prior to the death of 
the President due to his poor health, the 
Executive Body under his presidentship passed 
a resolution on 01.07.1997 empowering Advocate 
Babasaheb Wasade (appellant No. 1) to be 
designated as the Working President and he was 
required to look after day-to-day affairs and 
management of the Society. This status of 
Working President was given to the appellant 
No.1 at a time when the President was suffering 
from serious illness and later on succumbed due 

to ill health on 24.05.1998. 
 
5. As there was no elected President, Vice-President 
or the Secretary, 16 members of the Society 
requested appellant No.1 vide written request 
dated 20.08.2002 to summon extraordinary 
meeting to hold the elections. Pursuant to the 
receipt of the said request, the appellant No.1 
acting as Working President, issued notice on 
03.09.2002 for summoning a special meeting for 
the elections of new Executive Body. The 
elections were held on 08.09.2002 and a new 
Executive Committee was elected with appellant 
No.1 as the President and appellant No.2 as the 
Secretary. Accordingly, a Change Report bearing 
no. 668 of 2002 was submitted under Section 22 
of the Trusts Act before the Assistant Charity 
Commissioner, Chandrapur. 

6. Objections were filed by 7 persons alleging to be 
members of the Society on the ground that notice 
dated 03.09.2002 had not been served on them 
and that appellant No.1 had no authority to issue 
notice to summon a meeting for election. It was 
also alleged in the objections that the signatory 
nos. 12 to 16 to the request letter dated 
20.08.2002, were not valid members of the 
Society and were yet to be approved by the 
Executive Committee. Further signatory nos. 4 to 
7 of the same objection had retired and hence, 
they ceased to be members. 
 
7. The elected Secretary filed his response to the 
said objections stating therein that signatory 
nos. 4 to 7 and 12 to 16 are valid members of the 
Society. Further that the 7 Objectors had not 
paid their annual subscriptions for more than 

the prescribed period under Section 15 of the 
Registration Act as such they were barred from 
voting, and therefore, even if notices were not 
sent to them, it would not make any difference. 
 
8. Before the Assistant Charity Commissioner 
parties led evidence. The Assistant Charity 
Commissioner vide order dated 19.06.2010 
allowed the objections and accordingly rejected 
the Change Report. The appellant preferred an 
appeal before the Joint Charity Commissioner, 
Nagpur. The appeal was allowed by order dated 
12.04.2016 
and 
the 
Change 
Report 
was 
accepted. Against this, Miscellaneous Civil 
Application No. 50 of 2016 was filed by the 
Objectors 
before 
the 
District 
Judge-4, 
Chandrapur, which was allowed vide judgment 
dated 29.07.2016. Aggrieved by the same, the 

First Appeal was preferred before the Bombay 
High Court which has since been dismissed by 
the impugned order, giving rise to the present 
appeal. 
 
9. Certain facts are not disputed by the parties. The 
same are being recorded hereunder: 
i) 
7 Objectors who had filed objections 
against 
the 
Change 
Report 
were 
admittedly defaulters in payment of their 
annual subscriptions, and were covered 
by the second part of Section 15 of the 
Registration Act which stated that no 
person shall be entitled to vote or be 
counted as a member whose subscription 
at the time shall have been in arrears for 
a period exceeding three months. The 7 
Objectors admittedly fell under this 

category of default. ii) 
Notice 
for 
the 
meeting 
fixed 
for 
08.09.2002 was not issued to the 7 
Objectors for the reason that they were in 
arrears and as such would not have the 
right to vote or be counted as members. iii) All the office bearers holding important 
posts like President, Vice-President and 
Secretary had expired prior to request 
dated 20.08.2002 and no election had 
been held till then to fill up the said posts. iv) The appellant No.1 was functioning as 
Working President since 1997 without 
there being any challenge to such 
assignment 
in 
the 
Executive 
Body 
meeting dated 01.07.1997. v) 
All the 7 Objectors who had filed 
objections to the Change Report had died 

during the pendency of the appeal before 
the Joint Charity Commissioner. The 
contesting respondents applied before the 
Joint 
Charity 
Commissioner 
to 
be 
impleaded as respondents. Said request 
was allowed, despite objections by the 
appellants that they had no locus as they 
were neither trustees or members of the 
Society or the Trust. vi) The appellants are in effective control of 
the Society and the Trust for the last more 
than two decades and are being elected 
during fresh elections held in the last two 
decades. 
10. We have heard Shri Shekhar Naphade, learned 
Senior Counsel for the Appellants and Shri 
Narender 
Hooda, 
learned 
Senior 
Counsel 
appearing for the private respondents. 

11. The arguments of Shri Naphade on behalf of the 
appellants are briefly summarised hereunder: 
i) 
Today none of the 7 Objectors are alive. 
The private respondents to this appeal 
having not raised any objections to the 
Change Report, cannot be heard because 
they are neither trustees or members of 
any category of the Society. ii) 
Consistent 
finding 
recorded 
by 
the 
Authorities, the District Judge and the 
High Court is that the 7 Objectors were in 
default in payment of their annual 
subscription and therefore, were not 
entitled to any notice for the meeting of 
the elections as they were prohibited from 
voting and being counted as member 
under 
Section 

of 
the 
Societies 

Registration 
Act. 
The 
Courts 
below 
committed an error in holding that due to 
lack of service of notice, the proceedings 
of 
meeting 
dated 
08.09.2002 
were 
vitiated. iii) The appellants are in effective control of 
the Society as also the Trust and have 
been functioning in accordance with its 
bye-laws for more than two decades and 
they are continuing to hold elections from 
time to time, and should therefore, not be 
disturbed. iv) The reasoning given by the Courts below 
that as there was no order of cancellation 
of membership or cessation of the 
membership, the 7 Objectors would be 
entitled to notice and the question 
whether they would be allowed to vote or 

not would be a separate issue. v) 
Reliance has been placed upon by Shri 
Naphade on a judgment of this Court in 
the 
case 
of 
Hyderabad 
Karnataka 
Education Society Versus Registrar of 
Societies and Others4, where a provision 
similar to Section 15 of the Registration 
Act was being considered and this Court 
held that the provision was valid and a 
member 
defaulting 
in 
payment 
of 
subscription 
would 
for 
all 
practical 
purposes be deemed to not be a member 
entitled to notice. 
 
12. On the other hand, Mr. Hooda has strongly relied 
upon the reasoning given by the High Court. i) 
He has submitted that it suffers from no 
 
4 In (2000) 

infirmity, warranting any interference. ii) 
The appellants are not entitled to any 
relief from this Court, as they were not 
entitled to convene the meeting for the 
elections. Appellant No.1 was neither 
Secretary nor President and under the 
bye-laws, it is the Secretary who would 
convene the meeting. iii) He further reiterated that the effect of 
Section 15 of the Registration Act would 
not be of cancelling the membership of the 
Objectors. Referring to the Hyderabad 
Karnataka Education Society (supra) 
case, Mr. Hooda submitted that in the 
aforesaid case under the bye-laws there 
was a provision that if there was a default, 
the membership would stand cancelled, 
which is not the case here as there is no 

such provision under the bye-laws. 
According to him, the said judgment 
would be of no help to the appellant as it 
would not apply to the present case. iv) Lastly, it was submitted that a number of 
signatories 
to 
the 
requisition 
dated 
20.08.2002 and also elected as executive 
members 
on 
08.09.2002, 
were 
not 
members of the Society at that time for the 
reason that either they had retired or were 
never elected as per the bye-laws. v) 
Mr. Hooda has further relied upon the 
following judgments as part of his 
submissions: 
i. 
Shri 
Bhaurao 
Versus 
Shri 
Dyaneshwar, in First Appeal No. 1435 
of 2017 passed by the High Court of 
Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, 

ii. 
Ramesh 
Gangadhar 
Dongre 
and 
another vs. Charity Commissioner, 
Mumbai and others5, 
iii. 
Santosh vs. Purushottam6, 
iv. 
Shri Sarbjit Singh & Others vs. All 
India fine Arts & Crafts Society & 
Others7. 
13. Having considered the respective submissions, 
the following questions arise for consideration: 
i) 
Whether the Working President Mr. 
Wasade could have convened the election 
meeting for 08.09.2002 as according to 
the Objectors, it was only the Secretary or 
in the alternative the President who could 
have convened the meeting under the bye-
 
5 2020(5) Mh.L.J. 
6 2017(6) Mh.L.J. 
7 ILR (1989) 2 Del 585 

laws? ii) 
Whether the 7 Objectors were entitled to a 
notice for the meeting of 08.09.2002 in 
view 
of 
their 
disqualification 
under 
Section 15 of the Registration Act? iii) Whether lack of notice to the said 7 
Objectors would vitiate the entire election 
meeting of 08.09.2002? iv) Whether invalid members had signed the 
requisition dated 20.08.2002 and had 
been elected to the Executive Committee? v) 
Whether the private respondents had the 
locus to be heard before any forum or to 
file an appeal/petition against the order of 
the Joint Charity Commissioner? 
 
14. It is not in dispute that in the meeting of the 
Executive Body held on 01.07.1997, the then 

President on account of his ill health had got a 
resolution passed that Mr. Wasade would 
thereon be the Working President and will look 
after the day-to-day affairs and management of 
the Society. The said resolution of 01.07.1997 
was not put to any challenge by any of the 
Trustees or the members of the General Body. It 
is also not in dispute that before 20.08.2002, the 
President, the Secretary, the Vice-President and 
the Joint-Secretary were not alive. In the absence 
of the office bearers authorised under the bye-
laws who could convene the meeting, the only 
option left for convening the meeting could either 
be with the Working President on his own or 
upon the requisition made by the members to 
convene a meeting. 
 
15. There is a doctrine of necessity where under 

given circumstances an action is required to be 
taken under compelling circumstances. One of 
the earlier proponents of the Doctrine of 
necessity 
in 
Common 
Law 
was 
William 
Blackstone, who in his book, “Commentaries on 
the Laws of England” Book 1 of the Rights of 
Persons, 
discusses 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
convention-parliament before Charles II's return, 
noting that it was an extraordinary measure 
taken out of necessity. He describes the use of 
the doctrine of necessity to justify actions that 
would otherwise be outside the norm due to the 
urgent need to restore order. He describes 
another instance during the Glorious Revolution 
when the lords and commons assembled and 
acted without the usual royal summons, justified 
by the extraordinary circumstance of a perceived 
vacant throne and the urgent need to address the 

governance of the country. 
“It is also true, that the convention-
parliament, 
which 
restored 
king 
Charles the second, met above a 
month before his return; the lords by 
their own authority, and the commons 
in pursuance of writs issued in the 
name of the keepers of the liberty of 
England by authority of parliament: 
and that the said parliament sat till 
the twenty ninth of December, full 
seven months after the restoration; 
and enacted many laws, several of 
which are still in force. But this was for 
the necessity of the thing, which 
supersedes all law; for if they had not 
so met, it was morally impossible that 
the kingdom should have been settled 
in peace. And the first thing done after 
the king's return, was to pass an act 
declaring this to be a good parliament, 
notwithstanding the defect of the 
king's writs. So that, as the royal 
prerogative was chiefly wounded by 
their so meeting, and as the king 
himself, who alone had a right to 
object, 
consented 
to 
wave 
the 
objection, this cannot be drawn into 
an example in prejudice of the rights of 
the crown. Besides we should also 
remember, that it was at that time a 
great 
doubt 
among 
the 
lawyers, 
whether even this healing act made it 
a good parliament; and held by very 

many in the negative: though it seems 
to have been too nice a scruple. 
 
It is likewise true, that at the time of 
the revolution, A.D. 1688, the lords 
and commons by their own authority, 
and upon the summons of the prince 
of Orange, (afterwards king William) 
met in a convention and therein 
disposed of the crown and kingdom. 
But it must be remembered, that this 
assembling was upon a like principle 
of necessity as at the restoration; that 
is, upon an apprehension that king 
James the second had abdicated the 
government, and that the throne was 
thereby vacant: which apprehension of 
theirs 
was 
confirmed 
by 
their 
concurrent resolution, when they 
actually came together. An in such a 
case as the palpable vacancy of a 
throne, 
it 
follows ex 
necessitate 
rei, that the form of the royal writs 
must be laid aside, otherwise no 
parliament can ever meet again. For, 
let us put another possible case, and 
suppose, for the sake of argument, 
that the whole royal line should at any 
time fail, and become extinct, which 
would indisputably vacate the throne: 
in this situation it seems reasonable to 
presume, that the body of the nation, 
consisting of lords and commons, 
would have a right to meet and settle 
the government; otherwise there must 

be no government at all. And upon this 
and 
no 
other 
principle 
did 
the 
convention in 1688 assemble. The 
vacancy of the throne was precedent to 
their 
meeting 
without 
any 
royal 
summons, not a consequence of it. 
They did not assemble without writ, 
and then make the throne vacant; but 
the throne being previously vacant by 
the king's abdication, they assembled 
without writ, as they must do if they 
assembled at all. Had the throne been 
full, their meeting would not have been 
regular; but, as it was really empty, 
such 
meeting 
became 
absolutely 
necessary. 
And 
accordingly 
it 
is 
declared by statute 1 W & M. st. 1. c. 
1. that this convention was really the 
two 
houses 
of 
parliament, 
notwithstanding the want of writs or 
other 
defects 
of 
form. 
So 
that, 
notwithstanding these two capital 
exceptions, which were justifiable only 
on a principle of necessity, (and each 
of which, by the way, induced a 
revolution in the government) the rule 
laid down is in general certain, that the 
king, only, can convoke a parliament.” 
 
16. The doctrine of necessity has been elucidated by 
a Constitution Bench of this Court in Charan Lal 

Sahu vs. Union of India8 as follows: 
“The question whether there is scope 
for 
the 
Union 
of 
India 
being 
responsible or liable as a joint tort-
feasor is a difficult and different 
question. But even assuming that it 
was 
possible 
that 
the 
Central 
Government might be liable in a case 
of this nature, the learned Attorney 
General was right in contending that it 
was only proper that the Central 
Government should be able and 
authorised to represent the victims. In 
such a situation, there will be no scope 
of the violation of the principles of 
natural 
justice. 
The 
doctrine 
of 
necessity would be applicable in a 
situation of this nature. The doctrine 
has been elaborated, in Halsbury's 
Laws of England, 4th edn., page 89, 
paragraph 73, where it was reiterated 
that even if all the members of the 
Tribunal competent to determine a 
matter 
were 
subject 
to 
disqualification, 
they 
might 
be 
authorised and obliged to hear that 
matter by virtue of the operation of the 
common law doctrine of necessity. An 
adjudicator 
who 
is 
subject 
to 
disqualification on the ground of bias 
or interest in the matter which he has 
to 
decide 
may 
in 
certain 
circumstances 
be 
required 
to 
 
8 In (1990) in para 105 

adjudicate if there is no other person 
who is competent or authorised to be 
adjudicator or if a quorum cannot be 
formed without him or if no other 
competent 
tribunal 
can 
be 
constituted. In the circumstances of 
the case, as mentioned hereinbefore, 
the Government of India is only 
capable to represent the victims as a 
party. The adjudication, however, of 
the claims would be done by the court. 
In those circumstances, we are unable 
to accept the challenge on the ground 
of the violation of principles of natural 
justice on this score. The learned 
Attorney General, however, sought to 
advance, as we have indicated before, 
his contention on the ground of de 
facto validity. He referred to certain 
decisions. We are of the opinion that 
this principle will not be applicable. 
We are also not impressed by the plea 
of 
the 
doctrine 
of 
bona 
fide 
representation of the interests of 
victims in all these proceedings. We 
are of the opinion that the doctrine of 
bona fide representation would not be 
quite relevant and as such the 
decisions cited by the learned Attorney 
General need not be considered.” 

17. The applicability of the Doctrine of Necessity was 
further clarified by this Court in Election 

Commission of India v. Dr Subramaniam 
Swamy reported in (1996) as follows: 
“ 16. We must have a clear conception 
of the doctrine. It is well settled that 
the law permits certain things to be 
done as a matter of necessity which it 
would otherwise not countenance on 
the touchstone of judicial propriety. 
Stated differently, the doctrine of 
necessity makes it imperative for the 
authority to decide and considerations 
of judicial propriety must yield. It is 
often invoked in cases of bias where 
there is no other authority or Judge to 
decide the issue. If the doctrine of 
necessity is not allowed full play in 
certain 
unavoidable 
situations, 
it 
would impede the course of justice 
itself and the defaulting party would 
benefit therefrom. Take the case of a 
certain taxing statute which taxes 
certain perquisites allowed to Judges. 
If the validity of such a provision is 
challenged who but the members of 
the judiciary must decide it. If all the 
Judges are disqualified on the plea 
that striking down of such a legislation 
would benefit them, a stalemate 
situation may develop. In such cases 
the doctrine of necessity comes into 
play. If the choice is between allowing 
a biased person to act or to stifle the 
action altogether, the choice must fall 

in favour of the former as it is the only 
way to promote decision-making. In 
the present case also if the two 
Election Commissioners are able to 
reach a unanimous decision, there is 
no 
need 
for 
the 
Chief 
Election 
Commissioner to participate, if not the 
doctrine of necessity may have to be 
invoked.” 

18. In the present case, had the Working President 
not convened the meeting, the elections of the 
executive body would have been in limbo for an 
unreasonable amount of time. The convening of 
the meeting by the Working President upon the 
requests by the 16 surviving members was a 
“necessity” at the time. 
 
19. There is one more aspect of the matter to be 
discussed here with respect to the duties of the 
‘Working President’. Clause 11 of the Byelaws 
recognizes a Working President and also defines 
his rights and duties. The same is reproduced 

below: 
“11. “Working President” – 
 
The Rights and Duties of Working President: 
1. To complete the work as per the written 
instructions of the President of the 
Shikshan Prasarak Mandal, the executive 
body of the Mandal and the General Body 
of the Mandal. 
2. Make efforts from the point of extending 
the area of operation of the Shikshan 
Prasarak Mandal.” 

As per the above clause, the ‘Working 
President’ was to act on the directions of the 
President, Executive Body and the General Body. 
In the present case, the recognition was by almost 
all the members of the General Body. He had no 
option but to call for a general body meeting in 
accordance with the rights and duties conferred 
upon him. 
 
20. In the present case, it was not only appropriate 

but also legal for the surviving members to 
request for convening a meeting. Further in the 
present case, as many as 16 members had 
requested in writing for convening the meeting. If 
the submission of the Objectors is to be accepted 
that the Working President could not convene the 
meeting, then no alternative has been suggested 
by the Objectors as to who could convene the 
meeting. 
Alternatively, 
the 
President 
and 
Secretary who were authorized under the bye-
laws had died and no election had been held for 
replacing them. Even the Vice-President and the 
Joint-Secretary had also passed away and they 
had also not been replaced by any fresh elections. 
The only person who could be said to be 
managing the affairs of the Society was the 
Working 
President 
Mr. 
Wasade, 
and 
in 
particular, when all the 16 surviving and valid 

members had made a request for convening a 
meeting, no fault could be found with the 
decision of the Working President Mr. Wasade to 
convene the meeting. The other option could have 
been that all the 16 members could have 
themselves nominated any one of the members to 
chair the meeting of the Executive Body and 
thereafter they could have proceeded to take 
appropriate decisions. In such situation, we are 
of the view that the convening of the meeting for 
holding the elections on 08.09.2002 cannot be 
faulted 
with. 
Question 
No.1 
is 
answered 
accordingly in favour of the appellants. 
 
21. Coming to the next question regarding notice to 
the objectors, at the outset, Section 15 of the 
Registration Act is reproduced hereunder: 
“Section 15 in The Societies Registration Act, 

15. 
Member 
defined.— 
Disqualified 
members - For the purposes of this Act a 
member of a society shall be a person who, 
having been admitted therein according to 
the rules and regulations thereof, shall have 
paid a subscription, or shall have signed the 
roll or list of members thereof, and shall not 
have resigned in accordance with such 
rules 
and 
regulations; 
Disqualified 
members.—But in all proceedings under 
this Act no person shall be entitled to vote 
or be counted as a member whose 
subscription at the time shall have been in 
arrears for a period exceeding three 
months.” 
 
The High Court, in the impugned order, has 
held that the said provision is applicable. 
 
22. It is not in dispute that all the Objectors were in 
arrears of their membership fee for a period of 
more than three months. This fact is admitted as 
is recorded by not only the High Court but all the 
three authorities. In fact, these Objectors had 
gone to the extent of saying that even if notices 
were issued to them, they will not receive it. The 

question is what would be the effect of such non-
payment in the light of the proviso contained in 
Section 15 of the Registration Act. The specific 
language used is that such members in default 
of membership fee would not be entitled to vote 
and would not be counted as members of the 
Society. If they were not entitled to vote and they 
were not to be counted as members, there would 
be no illegality or for that matter any prejudice 
being caused by not issuing any notice as the 
same would be an exercise in futility. 
 
23. It is a fact that under the bye-laws of the Society, 
there was no provision that a member defaulting 
in payment of membership fee and duly covered 
by the proviso to Section 15 of the Registration 
Act, would automatically lose his membership or 
in effect would cease to be a member of the 

Society. Be that as it may the only limited status 
left of such members would be that their name 
would continue to be in the Roll of the Society 
and at best by clearing of the arrears of the 
membership fee in addition to any penalty or fine 
liable to be charged for being reinstated as valid 
members would survive to them. Such defaulting 
members could have applied that they are ready 
and willing to pay their arrears and upon such 
application and payment being made, the effect 
of the proviso to Section 15 of the Registration 
Act could be considered by the appropriate 
officer/Committee of the Society. Till such time 
they would continue to remain as suspended 
members having no right to participate in any 
meeting. 
 
24. The Executive Body or any other body competent 

under the bye-laws could take up their matter 
and give them a show cause notice and 
opportunity to save their membership by 
fulfilling their obligations failing which their 
membership would be terminated. When despite 
the same, they would not fulfil their obligations 
their membership would be declared to have 
been terminated. 
 
25. This Court in the case of Hyderabad Karnataka 
Education Society (supra) was dealing with a 
similar provision under Rule 7-A of the Rules 
framed by Hyderabad Karnataka Education 
Society, read with Section 2(b) and Section 6(2) 
proviso of the Karnataka Societies Registration 
Act, 1960. Section 2(b) of the said Act defined 
‘member’ which provided that to be treated as a 
member of the Society for the year concerned, he 

should have been admitted to that membership 
in accordance with rules and regulations and 
shall have paid the subscription as laid down 
therein. Section 6(2) of the said Act was akin to 
the proviso to Section 15 of the Registration Act 
that in default of payment of membership fee for 
more than three months, the membership would 
cease. The validity of such rule 7-A was 
challenged before the High Court which found 
the same to be very harsh and accordingly had 
held it to be ultra vires of Section 6(2) of the 
Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960. This 
Court disagreed with the reasoning given by the 
High Court and accordingly set it aside. This 
Court held that the said rule could not be said to 
be harsh or unreasonable, rather it was in line 
and in tune if it is read with Section 2(b) and 
Section 6(2) of the said Act. 

26. It is true that in the bye-laws of the present 
Society or the Rules of the Society, there is no 
such 
provision 
of 
automatic 
cessation 
of 
membership where a member goes in default of 
payment of membership fee for more than three 
months. However, the effect of the proviso to 
Section 15 of the Registration Act which 
admittedly is applicable to the Society, the 
Objectors have to be treated as suspended 
members and therefore, would not be entitled to 
any notice as they had no right to vote or to be 
counted as members. Once they are not to be 
counted as members, there was no occasion to 
give them notice as such Non-issuance of notice 
to the Objectors would not vitiate the proceeding 
of the special meeting held on 08.09.2002. The 
argument raised by Mr. Hooda is to the effect that 

Hyderabad 
Karnataka 
Education 
Society 
(supra) judgment would not apply to the present 
case and would be of no help to the appellant. 
This submission same cannot be accepted in 
view of the discussion made above and also for 
the reasoning given by this Court in the said 
judgment. Even if we do not take into 
consideration the judgment of this Court 
Hyderabad 
Karnataka 
Education 
Society 
(supra), we may record that a clear reading and 
interpretation of the proviso to Section 15 of the 
Registration Act would disentitle such defaulting 
members from being given any notice even if their 
membership was not terminated or ceased. 
Question nos. 2 and 3 are thus answered in 
favour of the appellants. 
 
27. In so far as the fourth question is concerned with 

regard to the participation of invalid members in 
signing the requisition and being elected in the 
executive is concerned, the same have been duly 
explained by the appellants. The signatories at 
serial nos. 12 to 16 of the requisition dated 
20.08.2002, had been duly admitted in the 
General Body Meeting on 11.11.2001. The said 
resolution of the meeting was never challenged. 
The same is on record as Exhibit 131 and one of 
the Objectors Dhanji Virji Shah was a signatory 
in the said proceeding. With respect to the 
objections relating to signatory nos. 4 to 7, the 
explanation is that were of the category of 
Employee Members. In due course they had 
retired from service. However, even after their 
retirement, they had continued to pay their 
subscription. As their membership(s) have 
continued, at this stage, objection(s) with regard 

to the validity thereof is not being examined in 
detail, given the lack of clarity and absence of 
material facts on this aspect. 
 
28. Coming to the last question regarding locus of 
the contesting respondent which has been 
seriously pressed by Mr. Naphade, learned 
Senior Counsel no material has been placed 
before us by the respondent senior Counsel Mr. 
Hooda to establish their locus. 
 
29. During the pendency of the appeal before the 
Joint Charity Commissioner all the seven 
objectors 
had 
died. 
The 
Joint 
Charity 
Commissioner decided in favour of the appellants 
and directed for accepting the Change Report. 
The contesting respondent preferred a petition 
before the District Judge. He was neither an 
objector 
before 
the 
Assistant 
Charity 

Commissioner nor a valid member of the Society. 
He would have no locus to maintain the petition 
before 
the 
District 
Judge. 
Although 
the 
contesting respondent claimed himself to be the 
Vice-President of the Society but has not been 
able to substantiate his claim. On this ground 
alone the District Judge ought to have dismissed 
the petition. 
 
30. The judgments relied upon by Mr. Hooda referred 
to above are on issue which were not argued 
before the High Court even otherwise they relate 
to 15 days’ notice for convening a meeting which 
point could have been raised by a valid member 
and not by a suspended member. 
 
31. For all the reasons recorded above, the impugned 
judgment of the High Court and the other 
authorities adverse to the appellants cannot be 

sustained. The Change Report No.668 of 2002 
deserves to be accepted. The Joint Charity 
Commissioner had rightly accepted it. 
 
32. The appeal is accordingly allowed. The impugned 
judgment and order of the High Court as also the 
orders rejecting the Change Report regarding 
General Body Meeting dated 08.09.2002 are set 
aside and the Change Report is accepted. 
 
33. However, having allowed the appeal, before 
parting, we would like to address one grey area, 
which having been left unexplained cannot be 
brushed aside. Insofar as it relates to four 
signatories to the Requisition for calling a 
General 
Body 
Meeting, 
specifically 
being 
Members 4 to 7 from the category of Employee 
Members, from a perusal of the available record, 

it transpires that they had retired from service. 
Yet even after this, they had continued to pay 
their 
subscription 
and 
as 
such, 
their 
membership had continued. 
 
34. In this context, the obvious question that arises 
is that once the said Members were Employee 
Members, their categorisation as such was 
dependent on them being in service. On 
retirement, the said signatories would cease to be 
employees, come out of the category of Employee 
Members and their membership in the Society 
could not have continued. Upon superannuation 
or cessation of their employment, such four 
signatories could very well have been made 
members of the Society, but there is no indication 
on the record that they were made members of 
the Society by a specific resolution and thereafter 
continued as members and paid the subscription 

fee(s). Thus, they could not have continued as 
members of the Society in the category of 
Employee 
Members 
even 
upon 
their 
superannuation by merely paying the yearly 
subscription fee thereby blocking the entry of the 
persons, who were still employees. 
 
35. Moreover, we find that the stalemate in the 
Society has continued for a pretty long time, 
which does not bode well for any institution, 
much less an institution which is running 
educational institutions and is required to be run 
in a fair, transparent and legal manner. Thus, we 
direct that fresh elections shall be held for the 
new Executive Committee of the Society by the 
Charity Commissioner in accordance with law 
within six months from the receipt of a copy of 
this Judgment. It is left open for him to delve into 

all aspects of the matter for ensuring that the 
issue of membership/members of the Society is 
resolved in terms of the existing records of the 
Society, ascertaining the factual position and 
status of the members at relevant point of time 
as also their right to continue as members of the 
Society and be on the electoral roll for conduct of 
fresh election for constitution of a new Executive 
Committee. 
 
36. There shall be no order as to costs.
