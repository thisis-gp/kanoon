THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH

CRIMINAL APPEAL NO(S). OF 2024 
[ SLP (Crl.) No(s). 355 of 2024] 
 
JUDGMENT 
SATISH CHANDRA SHARMA, J. 
 
1. 
Leave granted. 
2. 
The present appeal i.e., SLP(Crl.) No 14988 
of 2023, seeks to assail the correctness of a judgment of the 
Learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at 
Allahabad (the “High Court”) dated 24.04.2023 wherein, the 
High Court allowed Vivek Pal ikki Pal’s / Respondent 
No. 2’s bail application under Section 439 of the Code of 

SLP (Crl.) No.14988 of 2023 

Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC”) and accordingly enlarged 
Respondent No. 2 on bail subject to certain conditions contained 
therein (the “Impugned Order”). 
3. 
By an order dated 31.10.2023, a co-accused i.e., Punit Pal 
was enlarged on bail by a coordinate bench of the High Court. 
The appeal filed by the Appellant against that order has been 
tagged with the present appeal vide an order dated 02.01.2024 in 
SLP (Crl) No. 355 of 2024. Moreover, as the facts and the 
questions involved in the present appeal(s) are similar, they have 
been heard together and are being disposed of by this common 
judgment. 
4. 
The facts of the case reveal that a First Information Report 
(the “FIR”) was lodged by the Appellant i.e., the Original 
Complainant, on 03.01.2022 stating that on 02.01.2022 at around 
3:30 PM, the Appellant along with his uncle i.e., Jitendra Singh 
(the “Deceased”) and his driver i.e., Rahul were returning from 
Bankati Bazar when their vehicle was stopped by the accused 
person(s) including inter alia (i) Respondent No. 2; and (ii) Punit 
Pal. The accused persons verbally abused the Deceased and 
proceeded to shatter the windows of the vehicle with iron rods. 
Subsequently they dragged the Deceased out of the vehicle – and 
physically assaulted the Deceased with iron rods, hockey sticks 
and bats with an intention to kill him. It was also alleged that 

SLP (Crl.) No.14988 of 2023 

although the Appellant and Rahul i.e., the Driver attempted to 
intervene, they were injured by the accused persons. The accused 
persons snatched the mobile phones of the Deceased and the 
driver; as well as a gold chain belonging to the Deceased and ran 
away from the spot of the incident. The Deceased was initially 
rushed to the Primary Health Centre, Bankati, however, due to 
the serious nature of the injuries he was referred to the District 
Hospital, Basti and thereafter to Sahara Hospital in Lucknow 
where he eventually succumbed to his injuries on 10.02.2022. 
5. 
On the same day i.e., 10.02.2022, (i) an inquest report of 
the person of the Deceased was prepared wherein injuries were 
recorded on the head, hand and knee; and (ii) a post-mortem was 
conducted which revealed 4 (four) major ante mortem head 
injuries on the person of the Deceased. Pertinently, the cause of 
death was identified as coma due to ante mortem head injuries. 
6. 
Notably, Respondent No. 2 came to be apprehended in 
relation to the FIR on 05.01.2022 and the murder weapon i.e., a 
bat used in the assault of the Deceased was also recovered at his 
instance. On the other hand, Punit Pal came to be apprehended 
on 07.01.2022. A chargesheet came to be filed in relation to the 
FIR on 14.03.2022 under Section(s) 147, 148, 149, 323, 504, 506, 
427, 394, 411, 302 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1872 
(“IPC”) read with Section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment 

SLP (Crl.) No.14988 of 2023 

Act, 2013 (the “Act”) (the “Chargesheet”). Pursuant to the filing 
of the Chargesheet, committal proceedings ensued and thereafter 
charges were framed against the accused person(s) vide an order 
dated 19.04.2023. 
7. 
Respondent No. 2 preferred an application seeking the 
grant of bail in relation to the proceeding(s) emanating from the 
FIR before the Learned Sessions Judge, Basti (the “Trial 
Court”). Vide an order dated 15.03.2022, the aforesaid bail 
application came to be rejected by the Trial Court. Thereafter, 
Respondent No. 2 filed an application seeking the grant of bail 
which came to be allowed by the High Court vide the Impugned 
Order. 
8. 
On the other hand, Punit Pal preferred an application 
seeking the grant of bail in relation to the proceeding(s) 
emanating from the FIR before the Trial Cour. Vide an order dated 
29.03.2022, the aforesaid bail application came to be rejected by 
the Trial Court. Thereafter, Punit Pal filed an application seeking 
the grant of bail which came to be allowed by the High Court vide 
an order dated 31.10.2023. 
9. 
The Appellant herein i.e., the Original Complainant filed 
the present appeals assailing the correctness of the order(s) 
passed by the High Court enlarging (i) Respondent No. 2; and (ii) 
Punit Pal on bail in relation to the FIR. 

SLP (Crl.) No.14988 of 2023 

10. 
The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant, 
urged the following: 
(a) The High Court ought not to have exercised its 
jurisdiction to grant Respondent No. 2 and Punit Pal 
bail in light of the fact that (i) charges had been framed 
against the accused person(s); (ii) recovery of the 
weapon used in the assault of the Deceased has been 
effected from Respondent No. 2; (iii) well-reasoned 
order(s)had been passed by the Trial Court declining 
the grant of bail to Respondent No. 2; and Punit Pal; 
(b) That there is a real and probable threat qua the ability 
to influence witnesses in light of the overwhelming 
influence exercised in the area by the accused 
person(s) including inter alia Respondent No. 2 and 
Punit Pal i.e., after the incident all shops near the place 
of occurrence remained shut for a period of 10 (ten) 
days; and 
(c) That Respondent No. 2; and Punit Pal have misused 
their liberty i.e., an identified witness had previously 
sought police protection from the Trial Court on 
account of threats having been extended to him during 
the pendency of the trial; and it was specifically 

SLP (Crl.) No.14988 of 2023 

contended that threats were extended to the Appellant 
himself by to Respondent No. 2; and Punit Pal. 
11. 
The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the 
Respondent State of Uttar Pradesh supported the stand of the 
Appellant. Moreover, it was brought to our attention that both 
Respondent No. 2; and Punit Pal were also being prosecuted 
under the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-
Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986. 
12. 
On the other hand, Mr. Sudhir Kumar Saxena, learned 
Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent No. 2; and 
Punit Pal has vehemently contended as under: 
(a) That Respondent No. 2; and Punit Pal have been 
cooperating with the trial, however, the Appellant has 
stalled proceedings before the Trial Court; and 
(b) That the allegation levelled against Respondent No. 2; 
and Punit Pal vis-à-vis extension of threats to the 
Appellant was wholly erroneous and is in fact, a part 
of a calculated effort to paint Respondent No. 2; and 
Punit Pal in bad light; and 
13. 
We have heard the learned counsel(s) appearing on behalf 
of the parties and perused the materials on record. 

SLP (Crl.) No.14988 of 2023 

14. 
The fulcrum of the dispute before this Court is whether the 
High Court appropriately exercised its discretion under Section 
439 of the CrPC to grant Respondent No. 2; and Punit Pal bail in 
relation to the proceeding(s) emanating out of the FIR? 
15. 
It is well settled that the grant of bail involves the exercise 
of a discretionary power which ought not to be used arbitrarily, 
capriciously; and injudiciously.1 In the aforesaid prism we must 
assess the correctness of the order(s) of the High Court granting 
Respondent No. 2; and Punit Pal bail in relation to the 
proceeding(s) emanating out of the FIR. 
16. 
This Court in Prasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee, 
(2010), enunciated certain parameters on which the 
correctness of an order granting bail must be evaluated. The 
relevant paragraph(s) are reproduced as under: 
“9. …It is trite that this Court does not, 
normally, interfere with an order [Ashish 
Chatterjee v. State of W.B., CRM No. 272 of 
2010, order dated 11-1-2010 (Cal)] passed 
by the High Court granting or rejecting bail 
to the accused. However, it is equally 
incumbent upon the High Court to exercise 
its discretion judiciously, cautiously and 
strictly in compliance with the basic 
principles laid down in a plethora of 
decisions of this Court on the point. It is well 
settled that, among other circumstances, the 
 
1 Neeru Yadav v. State of U.P., (2014) 

SLP (Crl.) No.14988 of 2023 

factors to be borne in mind while considering 
an application for bail are: 
 
(i) whether there is any prima facie or 
reasonable ground to believe that the 
accused had committed the offence; 
(ii) nature and gravity of the accusation; 
(iii) severity of the punishment in the event of 
conviction; 
(iv) danger of the accused absconding or 
fleeing, if released on bail; 
(v) character, behaviour, means, position and 
standing of the accused; 
(vi) likelihood of the offence being repeated; 

reasonable 
apprehension 
of 
the 
witnesses being influenced; and 
(viii) danger, of course, of justice being 
thwarted by grant of bail. 

*** 
10. 
It is manifest that if the High Court 
does 
not 
advert 
to 
these 
relevant 
considerations and mechanically grants bail, 
the said order would suffer from the vice of 
non-application of mind, rendering it to be 
illegal.” 
 
17. 
Furthermore, this Court in Mahipal v. Rajesh Kumar, 
(2020), followed Prasanta Kumar Sarkar (Supra) 
and succinctly summarised the position qua interference by this 
Court vis-à-vis an order granting bail. The relevant paragraph is 
reproduced as under: 
“14. The provision for an accused to be 
released on bail touches upon the liberty of 

SLP (Crl.) No.14988 of 2023 

an individual. It is for this reason that this 
Court does not ordinarily interfere with an 
order of the High Court granting bail. 
However, where the discretion of the High 
Court to grant bail has been exercised 
without the due application of mind or in 
contravention of the directions of this Court, 
such an order granting bail is liable to be set 
aside. The Court is required to factor, 
amongst other things, a prima facie view that 
the accused had committed the offence, the 
nature and gravity of the offence and the 
likelihood of the accused obstructing the 
proceedings of the trial in any manner or 
evading the course of justice. The provision 
for being released on bail draws an 
appropriate balance between public interest 
in the administration of justice and the 
protection of individual liberty pending 
adjudication of the case. However, the grant 
of bail is to be secured within the bounds of 
the law and in compliance with the 
conditions laid down by this Court. It is for 
this reason that a court must balance 
numerous factors that guide the exercise of 
the discretionary power to grant bail on a 
case-by-case 
basis. 
Inherent 
in 
this 
determination is whether, on an analysis of 
the record, it appears that there is a prima 
facie or reasonable cause to believe that the 
accused had committed the crime. It is not 
relevant at this stage for the court to examine 
in detail the evidence on record to come to a 
conclusive finding.” 

SLP (Crl.) No.14988 of 2023 

18. 
Turning to the issue at hand, we note that Respondent No. 
2; and Punit Pal have been charged under inter alia Section(s) 
147, 148, 149, 323, 504, 506, 427, 394, 411, 302 and 120B IPC 
on the basis of the materials on record including but not limited 
to the post-mortem report; and statements of witnesses. 
Furthermore, on 2 (two) occasions there have been allegations 
levelled against Respondent No. 2; and Punit Pal alleging inter 
alia that the accused persons have attempted to intimidate the 
Appellant i.e., the Original Complainant and another identified 
witnesses in an effort to de-rail the trial in the present case. 
19. 
Accordingly, in our considered opinion, the High Court 
ought not to have granted Respondent No. 2; and Punit Pal bail 
in relation to the proceedings emanating from the FIR on account 
of (i) the seriousness of the crime; (ii) the conduct of the accused 
person(s); and (iii) the overall impact of the crime on society at 
large i.e., the accused person(s) were involved in a broad day-
light murder which led to the closure of a market for a prolonged 
period of 10 (ten) days due to their overwhelming influence in 
the area. 
20. 
In the aforementioned context, the impugned orders dated 
24.04.2023 and 31.10.2023 granting bail to accused Vivek Pal ikki Pal and Punit Pal, respectively, cannot be sustained and are, 
accordingly, set aside. 

SLP (Crl.) No.14988 of 2023 

21. 
The appeals are allowed in the aforesaid terms. The bail 
bond(s) of accused Vivek Pal ikki Pal and Punit Pal shall 
stand cancelled. The aforenoted person(s) shall be taken into 
custody forthwith. A copy of this judgment shall be forwarded to 
the Trial Court and PS Lalganj, Basti, Uttar Pradesh for onward 
action and necessary compliance. The Trial Court is directed to 
conclude the trial expeditiously preferably within a period of one 
year from the date of receipt of copy of this judgment. 
22. 
It is clarified that any observations made in this judgment 
shall not be treated as an expression of opinion on the merits of 
the case at trial.
