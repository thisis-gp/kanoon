IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA 
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
 
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO(S). OF 2024 
[ Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No(s). 5104 of 2022] 

RAJASEKAR 

VERSUS 
THE STATE REP. BY THE 
INSPECTOR OF POLICE 

ORDER 
 
1. 
Leave granted. 
2. 
The Appellant before us is aggrieved by the judgement 
dated 26.10.2021 passed by the High Court of Judicature at 
Madras in whereby the High 
Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the Appellant and 
confirmed the judgement dated 03.02.2017, passed by the 
Sessions Court--convicting the Appellant for offences u/S. 3(a) 
r/w Sec. 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences 
(‘POCSO’) Act, 2012. 
3. 
At the outset, it must be noted that vide order dated 
12.07.2022, this Court issued notice only on the quantum of 

SLP(Crl.) No. 5104 of 2022 

sentence awarded to the Appellant. Therefore, only that limited 
question is required to be considered by this Court. 
4. 
Vide the judgement of the Sessions Court, the Appellant 
was sentenced to undergo ten years RI along with a fine of INR 
5,000 with a default clause to undergo SI for three months. The 
State Government was also directed to pay INR 1,00,000 to the 
victim as compensation under Rule 7(2) of the POCSO Rules, 
2012. The sentence imposed by the Sessions Court was 
confirmed by the High Court without any modification. 
5. 
Learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that at the time 
of conviction, the minimum sentence prescribed u/Sec. 4 of the 
POCSO Act was seven years and as on date, the Appellant has 
already served more than seven years of his sentence. It is also 
submitted that the Appellant is providing for the day-to-day 
expenses of the victim and her child and therefore, further 
imprisonment will impact not only his family but also the 
victim’s. On these grounds, Learned Counsel presses for 
leniency. 
6. 
Having heard the Learned Counsel for the parties and 
considering the totality of the circumstances of the case, we are 
of the view that the ends of justice would be met if the period of 
imprisonment awarded against the Appellant is reduced to the 
period already undergone by him. Accordingly, the appeal is 
allowed in part. The conviction of the Appellant u/s. u/S. 3(a) r/w 

SLP(Crl.) No. 5104 of 2022 

Sec. 4 of the POCSO Act, 2012 is hereby confirmed. However, 
the sentence imposed by the Sessions Court and confirmed by the 
High Court is hereby modified and reduced to the period already 
undergone by the Appellant. 
7. 
The Appellant be set at liberty forthwith in case he is not 
required in any other case. 
8. 
With the aforesaid, the appeal stands disposed of. Pending 
application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of.
