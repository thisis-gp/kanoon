suit was filed by the appellants for declaration to the effect that
the appellants/plaintiffs are in possession of the suit property as
absolute owners.
2.
Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior counsel appearing
for the appellants, submitted that Md. Yahya Khan, an evacuee
was the owner of the entire property ‘Spring Field’, which
comprised of Khasra Nos.233, 233/1, 233/3, 233/6, 233/7 and
234/4. Late Raja Dhian Singh was the Raja of Shiekhupura
(now in Pakistan). He had taken the entire property including
the buildings constructed thereon except Tarik Cottage and
Coal Shed, measuring 10,500 sq. yards from Md. Yahya Khan on
an annual rent of ₹2500/- in the name of his wife. He used the
place as his holiday home, whenever he visited Shimla before
partition of the country. After partition, Md. Yahya Khan
migrated to Pakistan. The property in question became an
evacuee property. It was to be administered in terms of the
1947 Act8. In terms thereof late Raja Dhian Singh became a
temporary allottee of the said property on payment of an
annual rent of ₹2500/- to the custodian. The rent was regularly
paid. At the time of partition, even Raja Dhian Singh migrated
to India. As he himself was a displaced person from West
8 East Punjab Evacuee’s (Administration of Property) Act, 1947

Pakistan, he was also entitled to benefits conferred on the
displaced persons under various enactments including the 1950
Act9 and 1954 Act10. The property in-question came in the
compensation pool under Section 12 of the 1954 Act.
3.
In September 1954, Rehabilitation Department
through Regional Settlement Commissioner, Jullundur, invited
tenders for sale of ‘Spring Field’ described as property
No.268/5. Vide the aforesaid tender, the entire evacuee
property was put to sale. Raja Dhian Singh being in occupation
of the said property was given first option to purchase the same
vide letter dated 03.12.1954. Immediately thereafter, vide
letter dated 10.12.1954, late Raja Dhian Singh gave his consent
to purchase the property in-question, known as ‘Spring Field’
for consideration of ₹40,000/-. The sale was confirmed in his
favour vide letter dated 17.12.1954. Letter of allotment dated
03.02.1955 was issued in favour of late Raja Dhian Singh
regarding the property in question. It was also stated that the
compensation due to him will be adjusted against the sale
price. On 02.02.1957, Raja Dhian Singh expired. A fresh sale
certificate was issued in favour of the legal heirs of Late-Raja
Dhian Singh on 24.03.1976. After the aforesaid certificate, the
9 Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950
10 Displaced Person (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 19054. appellants approached the revenue/municipal authorities for
transfer of the property in their names. However, the municipal
authorities raised objection stating that serial number and
evacuee number were not in consonance with the land in their
possession. The area and boundaries of the property had not
been provided. Thereafter, the appellants approached the Chief
Settlement Commissioner. Letter dated 28.03.1976 was issued
by the Tax Superintendent, Municipal Corporation, Shimla
stating that Spring Field comprised of 10,582 square yards. On
05.05.1976, another sale certificate was issued by the
Department of Rehabilitation mentioning the area of the
property as 2,786 square yards. Conveyance deed was also
executed on 05.10.1977. Immediately thereafter, the
appellants made representation for correction of the area, as
mentioned in the conveyance deed and the sale certificate. The
Chief Settlement Commissioner, treating the representation of
the appellants as revision petition, passed an order dated
25.06.1979, in exercise of powers under Section 24(1) of the
1954 Act. It was held that the area sold to the appellants was
2,786 square yards, however, at the spot it was found as
3,836.06 square yards. The appellants were directed to pay
cost of the additional area of 1,050.06 square yards @ ₹4/- per

square yard, according to the reserved price. Review petition
was filed by the appellants against order dated 25.06.1979.
However, the appellants deposited a sum of ₹4200.24 for the
additional area without prejudice to their rights. On 21.08.1979,
a fresh conveyance deed was executed in favour of the
appellants with reference to the boundaries and the area
mentioned in the sale certificate dated 05.05.1976 i.e. 3,836.06
square yards.
4.
The Chief Settlement Commissioner allowed the
review petition vide order dated 07.05.1980 holding that the
entire area of Spring Field was sold to late Raja Dhian Singh but
it was not shown in the sale certificate and the price for the
whole area was not paid, hence, for the additional area of
7,599.94 square yards, the appellants were directed to pay @
₹4/- per square yard. Even this was paid by the appellants to
avoid any litigation, however, under protest. Aggrieved against
the aforesaid order passed by the Chief Settlement
Commissioner, both the parties preferred revision petitions
before the Financial Commissioner (Revenue) Appeals-cum-
Secretary (Relief and Rehabilitation) to the Government of
Himachal Pradesh, Shimla. It was submitted that the order

passed by the Chief Settlement Commissioner was totally
without jurisdiction for the reason that after his transfer from
the post, he had ante-dated the order. The certified copy was
applied on 12.06.1981, however, the same was made available
to the appellants on 12.10.1982. He had set aside the order
passed by the Chief Settlement Commissioner, whereby the
additional area of 7,599.94 square yards was directed to be
transferred to the appellants on payment of additional price.
However, sale of 3,836.06 square yards was upheld. Thereafter,
the appellants filed civil suit11 for declaration of title and
ownership of the entire property known as ‘Spring Field’. The
Trial Court, vide judgment dated 31.05.1988 decreed the suit.
The appeal filed by the respondents was allowed by the first
Appellate Court vide judgment and decree dated 30.04.1997.
Thereafter, the appellants preferred second appeal before the
High Court, which was dismissed vide impugned judgment
dated 15.06.2009.
5.
The argument of learned senior counsel for the
appellants is that the property which was sold initially was
mentioned as ‘Spring Field’ with ID No. 268/5. The entire area
measuring 11435 square yards was in possession of the

predecessor-in-interest of the appellants. The tender notice did
not mention any specific area or the boundaries thereof, hence
it was understood that the entire area was forming part of the
identity of the property or the popular name, was put to sale.
The offer was submitted by the predecessor in interest of the
appellants keeping that in view. It was totally unreasonable on
the part of the respondents to have reduced the area later on.
6.
It was further submitted that under similar
circumstances, other properties were also sold, which were
having different identity numbers and popular names. There
also, the entire area, which was forming part of that property,
was transferred. Only the appellants have been discriminated.
7.
On the other hand, learned counsel for the
respondents submitted that, whatever was proposed to be sold,
was transferred to the predecessor-in-interest of the appellants.
Initially, the area transferred was 2,786 square yards, which
was in consonance with the covered area and reasonable open
area, however, later on even 1,050.06 square yards area was
also transferred in favour of the appellants, on payment of
additional price, to which no issue was raised. However, the
appellants became more greedy. They may be in possession of

large area as lessee from Md. Yahya Khan before partition and
thereafter as tenants on that property under the Rehabilitation
Department, however, that would not mean that the entire area
was proposed to be sold. Major part of the area was and still a
forest. He further submitted that the documents, which are
available on file clearly establish that. At the time of valuation
of the property before it was put to sale, Valuation Form ‘A’
clearly noticed the same as 2,786 square yards. The value
thereof was calculated in terms thereof. The draft thereof was
prepared on 13.08.1954 which was approved on 25.08.1954.
However, by tampering the year ‘1954’, it has been made as
‘1956’. The tender notice was issued in September 1954. The
calculation of area and the cost thereof was made much prior
thereto. The area, which was proposed to be sold, was
transferred in favour of the predecessor-in-interest of the
appellants. The sale certificate was also issued on 03.02.1955.
From the subsequent events also, the entire factual matrix is
clear as the authorities also found that the initial area sold to
the appellants was 2,786 square yards, however, on account of
some error, additional area of 1,050.06 square yards was
required to be given, which was directed on payment of
additional price, which was paid by the appellants. Even

thereafter, the Chief Settlement Commissioner also directed for
transfer of additional area of 7,599 square yards in favour of
the appellants on payment of additional price, which was also
paid by the appellants. The Trial Court had erroneously decreed
the suit. The error was corrected by the lower Appellate Court
and the judgment and decree passed by the lower Appellate
Court was rightly upheld by the High Court. The same does not
call for any interference by this Court. 
8.
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused
the paper book.
9.
 As is evident from the record of the case, an
estimate was proposed on 12.08.1954 for an area of 2,786
square yards on Valuation Form ‘A’, which was forming part of
‘Spring Field’. The same was approved on 25.08.1954. Tender
notice was issued in September 1954. The predecessor-in-
interest of the appellants being in occupation of the said
property was given first option to purchase the same vide letter
dated 03.12.1954. He consented for purchase of the property
on 10.12.1954. His offer was accepted which was confirmed on
17.12.1954. Allotment letter was issued on 03.02.1955 in his
favour. Raja Dhian Singh expired on 02.02.1957. His legal

representatives were substituted. A fresh sale certificate was
issued in their favour on 24.3.1976. The sale certificate, which
was issued in favour of the appellants on 05.05.1976 clearly
mentioned the area as 2,786 square yards. As is evident from
the record, first representation was made by the appellants on
22.11.1976 after issuance of sale certificate on 05.05.1976.
Despite filing the representation, they got the conveyance deed
registered in their favour for 2,786 square yards on 05.10.1977
but still continued to file representations. The Chief Settlement
Commissioner had taken up the matter and after examining the
case found that as per the site plan, the area would come out
to 3,836.06 square yards, which should prevail over the area
mentioned in the conveyance deed, hence the additional area
of 1,050.06 square yards was directed to be transferred in
favour of the appellants @ ₹4/- per square yard. The balance
area of 7,599.94 square yards was directed to be put to public
auction.
10.
Section 25 of the 1954 Act, which provides for review
of the orders passed under the Act, mentions that any person
aggrieved by an order of Settlement Officer under Section 5,
from which no appeal is allowed under Section 22, may, within

thirty days from the date of the order, file a review petition. It
further provides that a clerical or arithmetical error in any order
passed by an officer or authority under the Act may be
corrected by such officer or authority or the successor-in-office.
In the facts of the case, a review petition may not be
maintainable as it was not a case of an error arising from any
accidental slip or omission. In the earlier order dated
25.06.1979, the Chief Settlement Commissioner considered the
case of the appellants threadbare, on application filed by the
appellants. In fact, the appellants re-argued the matter on
merits which was not the scope of jurisdiction as provided in
Section 25 of the 1954 Act.
11.
Even otherwise, it is evident from the order dated
07.05.1980 passed in the review petition that the entire matter
was considered afresh. Merely because the appellants were in
possession of the entire area, which was forming part of ‘Spring
Field’, was presumed to have been sold. Whereas on the other
side, it was admitted that the amount paid by the appellants
was not with reference to the entire area in their possession but
was only for 2,786 square yards. In the revisions filed by both
the parties, the Financial Commissioner had considered the

issues raised threadbare. It has even noticed that before the
property was put to sale, the estimated cost thereof was
calculated with an initial area of 2,539 square yards, which was
later on corrected as 2,786 square yards. It was finally
approved on 25.08.1954, however the figure ‘4’ in the year
mentioned was tampered as ‘6’ to make it as 25.08.1956. It
may be for the reason to show that this exercise was done after
the sale was complete, whereas it was done before that. In
continuation of the aforesaid calculation on Valuation Form ‘A’,
the property in question was put to sale. The amount charged
from the appellants was also in terms thereof. It is so evident
even from the subsequent orders where also the additional
area was directed to be transferred to the appellants, they were
directed to pay additional price. Entire case built up is on
presumption only that the entire area in possession of the
appellants was put to sale, though the position was otherwise. 
12. 
In fact, the aforesaid clinching evidence was ignored
by the Trial Court while decreeing the suit in favour of the
appellants. The issue was considered by the lower Appellate
Court in detail. Considering that fact and the other material on
record, the judgment and decree of the Trial Court was

reversed. The finding recorded by the lower Appellate Court on
the issue of tampering of record and the fact that valuation of
the property to be sold was done prior to when the same was
put to sale, clinched the issue regarding the area proposed to
be sold and actually sold to the appellants. The High Court also
opined that valuation of the property sold to the appellants was
not made after the sale had been completed, rather it was done
before the same was put to sale. There was no answer to the
aforesaid findings of the lower Appellate Court and the High
Court. Merely with the identity of the property or its number, no
title can be passed on any prospective buyer, once a conscious
decision had been taken by the authority concerned to sell only
a portion thereof and not the entire area.
13.
The other examples given by the appellants would
also not come to their rescue for the reason that no such
detailed documents have been placed on record except the
identity number or the popular name of the property.
14.
For the reasons mentioned above, we do not find any
merit in the present appeal. The same is accordingly dismissed,
with no order as to costs.
