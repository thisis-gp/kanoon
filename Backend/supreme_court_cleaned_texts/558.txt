IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

( SLP (C) No.2997 OF 2023)
 
USHA DEVI & ORS.

VERSUS

RAM KUMAR SINGH & ORS. 

ORDER
1.
Leave granted. This is the defendant’s appeal against the
judgment and order dated 14.12.2022, passed by the High Court
of Jharkhand at Ranchi in Second Appeal No. 349 of 2005, Usha
Devi & Ors. versus Ram Kumar Singh & Ors., confirming the
judgment and decree of the First Appellate Court, decreeing the
suit for specific performance filed by the respondents.
2.
According to the plaint allegations, the facts are as follows:
2.1
The dispute relates to plot No. 2339, situated at Purulia
Road, Kumhar Toli, Gali No. 2, Namkum, District Ranchi, which
belonged to Kisun Ram, the grandfather of the appellants.

However, the plot was sub-divided amongst the co-sharers, and
plot No. 2339B of Khata No. 252 came into the share of Bihari
Lal, succeeded by the defendants after his death. 
2.2
During his lifetime, Bihari Lal is said to have entered into an
agreement with the plaintiff on 22.07.1983, for the sale of the
land along with superstructure for a total sale consideration of
Rs. 70,000/-. Out of the said amount, Rs. 1,000/- was paid in
advance. 
2.3
As per the said agreement, the sale deed was to be executed
upon payment of the remaining amount of Rs. 69,000/- within a
period of nine months. The sale deed was not executed within the
time stipulated. 
2.4
According to the respondents, the balance amount of Rs.
69,000/- was paid on 20.09.1985, for which an endorsement was
made on the agreement dated 20.09.1985, and it was agreed that
the sale deed would be executed by 30.11.1985. The plaintiffs-
respondents were put in possession of the property at that stage. 
2.5
The sale deed was still not executed, and a fresh agreement
came to be executed between the parties on 17.12.1989. 
2.6
The land in question, covered by the initial agreement to
sell, was 10 katthas. However, in 1989, a fresh measurement

exercise was undertaken according to which it came to only 9
katthas, and the price was enhanced from Rs. 7,000/- per kattha
to Rs. 9,000/- per kattha. 
2.7
At the time of the execution of the agreement dated
17.12.1989, an initial amount of 10,000/- was paid. Thus, out of
the total sale consideration of 81,000/-, only Rs. 1,000/-
remained as balance to be paid at the time of the execution of the
sale deed.
2.8
As per this agreement to sell, the sale deed was to be
executed and registered within one month i.e. up to 16.01.1990.
It is interesting to note that agreement to sell also incorporated a
clause at the end of the document stating that the said
agreement would be valid for five years. Since the sale deed was
not executed, the respondents instituted a suit for specific
performance of the contract in September, 1993. 
2.9
The affidavit filed along with the plaint was sworn and
attested on 13.09.1993. 
3.
The appellants filed a written statement denying the plaint
allegations. 
3.1
According to the defendants, the said agreement to sell was
a forged and fabricated document and did not bear the signatures

of their father, Bihari Lal, who had since died in 1990. 
3.2
The appellants further alleged that the suit was barred by
limitation inasmuch as it was filed beyond the period of three
years from the date of performance of the sale deed as per the
agreement. 
3.3
Various other issues were raised which we may not enter
into, as primarily, it is the issue of limitation which will decide
this appeal.
4.
Based on the pleadings, the Trial Court framed the following
issues:
a) Is the suit as framed maintainable? b) Have the plaintiffs got any valid cause of action of the suit? c) Is the suit barred by limitation? d) Is the suit bad due to non-joinder of necessary parties? e) Whether so-called agreements were done between the
plaintiffs and late Bihari Lal, husband of defendant No. 1
and whether those agreements are binding on Defendant
Nos. 1,2,4 and 5? f) Are the alleged agreements forged, fabricated and concocted,
which do not bear the signature of Bihari Lal? g) Whether at the time of agreement, Bihari Lal was the

absolute owner in possession of the suit property or
whether the suit property was joint? h) Is Ashok Kumar-defendant No.3 is the adopted son of Bihari
Lal or the son of Shivlal and whether he has the right to
contest this suit? i) Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the reliefs sought in
the plaint and other reliefs?”
5.
Both parties led evidence. The Trial Court, vide judgment dated
13.06.2004, dismissed the suit with costs. All the issues except
the issue nos. 1, 2 and 3 were decided in favour of the plaintiffs.
Insofar as issue no.3 is concerned it was held that the suit was
barred by limitation.
6.
The plaintiffs-respondents preferred an appeal registered as Title
Appeal No. 50 of 2004. The said appeal came to be allowed, vide
judgment dated 03.09.2005, and the suit was decreed. The
defendants were directed to execute and register the sale deed as
per the terms and conditions of the agreement dated 17.12.1989,
after receiving the balance consideration within 30 days.
7.
Aggrieved by the same, the defendants-appellants preferred a
second appeal before the High Court, which has since been
dismissed by the impugned order, giving rise to the present

appeal.
8.
We need not enter into the other issues as we are convinced that
the suit was barred by limitation. The limitation under Article 54
of the Limitation Act, 1963 for instituting a suit for specific
performance of a contract would be three years from the date
fixed for the performance, or, if no such date is fixed, when the
plaintiff has notice that performance is refused. Article 54 of the
Limitation Act, 1963 is reproduced hereunder:
“
***
54. 
For Specific 
performance of 
a contract
Three
Years
The date fixed for the
performance, or, if no such
date is fixed, when the
plaintiff has notice that
performance is refused.
9.
Coming to the facts of the present case, we find that in the
agreement dated 17.12.1989, it is specifically mentioned that the
sale deed would be executed within one month from the date of
the said agreement. The period of one month would expire on
16.01.1990, and once there is a specific date fixed for
performance, the limitation period would be three years from the
said date, which would expire on 16.01.1993. The Trial Court
thus held that the suit was barred by limitation as it was filed in

September 1993. 
10.
The First Appellate Court and the High Court went on the
consideration that the agreement further recorded that this
agreement would remain valid for a period of five years from
today’s date i.e. date of the execution of the agreement to sell.
Placing reliance on this clause, in our considered opinion, is
totally irrelevant. The performance was to take place within one
month. The validity of the agreement is something different and
does not change the date of performance. What was the reason
for incorporating this clause of validating the agreement for five
years is not spelled out in the agreement, but in any case, it does
not change the date fixed for the performance.
11.
As such, the suit was liable to be dismissed on the ground of
limitation alone. The appeal is thus liable to be allowed.
Therefore, we have not entered into the other issues regarding the
agreement to sell being valid or invalid. 
12.
Accepting that the plaintiffs-respondents paid an amount of Rs.
80,000/- to the defendant-appellant, and there being no relief
claimed for refund of this money, in order to do complete justice
between the parties, we feel it appropriate that the said amount
of Rs. 80,000/- be returned to the plaintiffs along with 12%

simple interest by the appellants within three months from today.
13.
The appeal is accordingly allowed. The impugned order is set
aside, and the suit is dismissed. However, it is directed that the
appellants shall return the advance amount of Rs. 80,000/- with
interest at the rate of 12 % per annum from the date it was paid
to the appellants till the date it is paid. There shall however be no
order as to costs.
