injuries, has filed the present appeal seeking enhancement of 
compensation. He is aggrieved by the order1 passed by the High 
Court2. 
 
1 Dated 24.08.2022 in MACA No.256 of 2019 
2 High Court of Orissa at Cuttack 

3. 
 
The facts as available on record are that on 16.01.2014 four 
persons occupying Verito Vibe Car bearing Registration No.OD-05-D-
9596 were travelling from Sambalpur, Odisha to Cuttack. At about 
01:30 pm, the offending Bus bearing Registration No.OD-14-A-1774 
being driven at high speed struck against the said car on NH-55 near 
CPP Chawk, NALCO, Anugul, Odisha, as a result of which the 
occupants of the car suffered serious injuries. One of the occupants, 
Ranjan Rout, succumbed to the injuries on 31.05.2017. A police case 
bearing P.S. Case No.7/2014 was registered against the driver of the 
offending bus under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of IPC3. Three injured 
occupants of the car and the legal heirs of the deceased, Ranjan Rout 
filed different claim petitions, which were assigned to the Court of 2nd 
Additional District Judge-cum-3rd Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, 
Cuttack. The present appellant had filed petition4 claiming 
compensation of ₹30,00,000/-. As all the claims had arisen from the 
same accident the Tribunal clubbed all the claim petitions and decided 
the same by a common Award5.

5 Dated 15.01.2019 

4. 
 
A perusal of the said Award passed by the Tribunal shows 
that registered owner of the offending bus did not appear despite 
service, hence, was proceeded against ex parte. The Insurance 
Company6 contested the claim petitions. The Tribunal framed the 
following issues: 
“(i) 
Whether 
the 
claim 
applications 
are 
maintainable? 

Whether due to rash and/or negligent 
driving of the driver of the offending vehicle bearing 
registration No.OD-14-A-1774 the accident took 
place and in that accident deceased namely Ranjan 
Rout succumbed to injuries and other petitioners 
namely Dipti Ranjan Pattanayak, Santosh Baral, and 
Chandramani Nanda sustained injuries on their 
persons? 

Whether the petitioners are entitled to get 
the compensation and if so, what would be the 
extent? 

Whether both the Opposite Parties or 
either of them are/is liable to pay the compensation? and 

To what other relief/s, if any, the 
respective petitioners are entitled?”

5. 
 
The Issue No.(ii) was decided in favour of the claimants. As 
far as entitlement of compensation is concerned, the claim of the 
present appellant was discussed under para ‘13’ of the Award of the 
Tribunal. The evidence led to the effect that he sustained head injury, 
which was grievous in nature. The claimant was initially admitted in 
Angul Government Hospital and due to his serious condition, he was 
shifted to Ashwini Hospital, Cuttack for better treatment and remained 
admitted there from 16.01.2014 to 11.02.2014. During that period, he 
had undergone a major brain surgery. The mother of the appellant in 
her statement stated that due to the accident, her son (appellant) had 
become mentally unsound. He is not able to understand anything and 
is bedridden since then. 
5.1 
 
The appellant visited Ashwini Hospital for his follow up after 
surgery on 17.06.2014, 15.09.2014 and 25.07.2015. It was claimed that 
the mother of the appellant spent about ₹15,00,000/- on his treatment, 
which is still going on. However, total bills produced towards medical 
expenses were to the tune of ₹3,31,153/-. The aforesaid amount was 
awarded by the Tribunal. The Record Keeper of the Ashwini Hospital 
was also summoned in evidence who proved the medical record of the 
appellant, which mentioned that he had sustained grievous head injury 
fracture of C6 and T4 vertebra. He also produced the medical bills. 

6. 
 
As far as the employment of the appellant is concerned, it 
was claimed that at the relevant point of time he was working as Branch 
Manager in Padma Infrastructure Private Limited and was earning 
salary of ₹22,000/- per month. However, the Tribunal referring to 
Income Tax return of the appellant (Ext.15)7 assessed the income at 
₹1,62,420/- per annum for the assessment year 2011-12 and that was 
made the basis for awarding compensation. His disability was assessed 
by the District Medical Board, Jagatsinghpur (Ext.13), according to 
which he was declared to be disabled to the extent of 60%. It is 
pertinent to note that the aforesaid assessment of disability of the 
appellant was conducted 02 years after the accident, meaning thereby, 
the disability was subsisting. It was claimed that on account of 60% 
disability suffered by the appellant, he had suffered 100% functional 
disability because of brain injury suffered by him. However, the 
Tribunal assessed the disability and loss in earning capacity only to the 
extent of 60%. 
7. 
 
The age of the appellant was about 32 years at the time of 
the accident. Since the appellant fell in the age group between 31 to 
35, multiplier 16 was applied for assessment of compensation, 
 
7 Inadvertently, recorded as Ext. 16 in the High Court and Tribunal’s order. referring to the judgment of this Court in Sarla Verma (Smt.) and 
others v. Delhi Transport Corporation and another8. 
8. 
 
While assessing the compensation, the Tribunal, in addition 
to the loss of future income calculated at 60% disability, awarded 
₹50,000/- on account of mental agony, pain and suffering, and loss of 
amenities, and further awarded ₹1,00,000/- for future medical 
expenses. The total compensation assessed was as under: 
Head 
Amount (in ₹) 
Loss of future income 
(₹1,62,420 x 16 x 60/100) 
15,59,232/- 
Past medical expenditure including 
cost of medicine, special diet & the 
attendant 
3,51,153/- 
Mental agony, pain, suffering and 
loss of amenities 
50,000/- 
Future medical expenses 
1,00,000/- 
Total 
20,60,385/- 
 
 along with interest @ 6% per annum 
9. 
 
Aggrieved against the said award of the Tribunal, the 
present appellant as well as the Insurance Company preferred 
appeals9 before the High Court. The High Court opined that the 
appellant had suffered 100% functional disability as against 60% 
assessed by the Tribunal because even if the disability from persistent

neurocognitive is 60%, such disability entails 100% loss of earning 
capacity. The High Court modified the Award of the Tribunal and 
enhanced the amount of compensation from ₹20,60,385/- to 
₹30,99,873/-.

In the present SLP, the learned counsel for the appellant 
submitted that while assessing the compensation, the Tribunal as well 
as the High Court have failed to appreciate that the income claimed by 
appellant was ₹22,000/- per month i.e. ₹2,64,000/- per annum. 
However, the assessment of compensation was made by taking the 
income at ₹1,62,420/- per annum, which pertained to assessment year 
2011-12 i.e. financial year 2010-11. It is to be noted that the accident 
had taken place on 16.01.2014, i.e. after 02 years from the said financial 
year. 

10.1 
It was further submitted that the amount of compensation 
should be enhanced by including factor of future prospect as it has not 
been considered by the Tribunal and High Court. Further, he should 
be awarded enhanced compensation under the head of future medical 
expenses as he would be required to incur medical expenses on a 
regular basis, and should also be granted compensation for an 
attendant. 
10.2 
Learned counsel for appellant also submitted that 
compensation on account of mental agony, pain and suffering and loss 
of amenities as assessed by the Tribunal is also on lower side as the 
appellant will undergo pain and suffering due to injuries and will go 
through mental agony throughout his life on account of brain injury. 
11. 
 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the Insurance 
Company submitted that the assessment of compensation by the High 
Court is on the higher side. There is no scope of further enhancement 
specially keeping in view the fact that the appellant had claimed a sum 
of ₹30,00,000/- as compensation, and the High Court has already 
awarded more than that. However, still being reasonable, the 
Insurance Company did not prefer any appeal. 

12. 
 
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the 
relevant materials on record. 
13. 
 
For the purpose of clarification, the High Court enhanced 
the compensation to Rs. 30,99,873 from Rs. 20,60,385 as awarded by 
Tribunal. This was done by considering the functional disability at 
100% as opposed to 60%, as assessed by the Tribunal. 
14. 
 
On the issue of assessment of income, we are of the view 
that that an enhanced income should be considered for calculation of 
compensation. In this regard, the appellant has produced on record his 
income tax returns for the assessment years 2010-11 and 2011-12 as 
Exhibits 14 and 15, respectively. As per the records, for the 
assessment year 2010-11 (the financial year will be 2009-10), the 
income shown by the appellant was to the tune of ₹1,65,100/-. For the 
assessment year 2011-12 (the financial year will be 2010-11), the 
income was shown as ₹1,77,400/-. Further, as per the Salary Certificate 
Exhibit-22 placed on record by the appellant, he was working as 
Branch Manager for Padma Infrastructure and he was getting a 
consolidated salary of ₹22,000 one year prior to the date of accident. 
Now, it is to be noted that the accident took place on 16.01.2014, in the 
financial year 2013-14. If we calculate the annual income considering 
₹22,000, it would come out to ₹2,64,000/- per annum. However, as per 

the High Court and the Tribunal, the annual income is assessed at 
₹1,62,420/-. However, both the courts below failed to consider the fact 
that there is a gap of approximately 02 years and 09 months between 
the said income tax returns and the date of accident. It can be seen that 
the income of the appellant, based on the income tax returns so 
produced on record is progressive, there is a possibility that he may 
have left his business and join service to improve his income. Thus, in 
our view, it would be reasonable to take the income of the appellant at 
₹2,00,000/- per annum, i.e., ₹16,666.67 per month. 
14.1 
With respect to the multiplier, we do not find any error in 
the order passed by the High Court applying the multiplier of 16 
considering the age of the appellant as 32 years on the date of the 
accident. 
14.2 
On the point of assessment of functional disability as 100% 
by the High Court as against 60% by the Tribunal, there is no challenge 
by the insurance company. 
14.3 
However, the Tribunal and the High Court both have failed 
to consider the fact that the appellant is also entitled for enhancement 
on account of future prospects. Hence, in line with the law laid down in 
National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi and 

Others10, given the age of appellant was 32 years at the time of 
accident, he is entitled to 40% future prospects. 
15. 
 
 As far as award of amount on account of medical 
expenditure is concerned, we do not find any case to be made out for 
further enhancement, as the amount awarded is in tune with the bills 
placed by the appellant on record. 
16. 
 
Coming to the compensation under the head of attendant, 
Tribunal awarded a meagre sum of ₹10,000/-. While this amount may 
have been awarded considering the cost of attendant charges incurred 
during the period of appellant’s treatment, as he remained admitted in 
hospital for 25 days and had to undergo surgery post initial operation 
as well. However, now, considering the fact of mental disability to be 
suffered by appellant, who is now around 40 years old and the age of 
the mother who is above 60 years old, and will be appellant’s primary 
caretaker, we are of the opinion that a reasonable amount for future 
attendant charges should also be awarded to the appellant. 
17. 
 
In this regard, we have perused the statement of the 
appellant’s mother (PW-3). As per her statement, initially they had 
engaged an attendant at ₹6,000 per month. However, he had left his 
 
10 (2017), [2017] SCR 100, 2017 INSC 1068 

services about a month before the mother was cross-examined on 23rd 
September, 2016. Further, the appellant’s father works as a priest and 
have a meagre monthly income. Thus, it is the appellant’s mother and 
other family members who are taking care of him. Considering the 
aforesaid facts, in our opinion, a lump sum amount of ₹1,00,000/- is 
reasonable and deserves to be awarded to the appellant on account of 
future attendant charges. 
18. 
 
In addition to the above, appellant is also entitled to 
compensation on account of loss of marriage prospects. A perusal of 
the impugned award of the Tribunal and the High Court shows that 
nothing has been awarded to the appellant under this head. In our 
opinion, considering the law laid down by this Court on this issue, the 
appellant deserves to be awarded a sum of ₹1,00,000/- on this account. 
19. 
 
Further, in our view, a compensation of ₹50,000/- on 
account of pain and suffering is also on lower side and the same 
deserves to be enhanced to ₹1,00,000/-. It is for the reason that on 
account of the injury suffered, the appellant has become mentally 
unstable, having disability of 60%, which indeed has resulted in 100% 
functional disability. 

20. 
 
An argument is raised by learned counsel for the insurance 
company that the appellant has initially claimed a sum of ₹30,00,000/- 
and since the same having been awarded to him by the High Court, no 
further enhancement is possible. We cannot accept this argument and 
it is duly rejected. It is a settled proportion of law, that the amount of 
compensation claimed is not a bar for the Tribunal and the High Court 
to award more than what is claimed, provided it is found to be just and 
reasonable. It is the duty of the Court to assess fair compensation. 
Rough calculation made by the claimant is not a bar or the upper limit. 
Reference in this regard can be made to the judgment of this Court in 
the case of Meena Devi vs. Nunu Chand Mahto11. 
21. 
 
For the reasons mentioned above, this appeal is allowed 
and the compensation awarded to the appellant is assessed in the 
following terms: 
 
Head 
Compensation 
(in ₹) 
Annual Income 
2,00,000

22. 
 
The total amount of compensation is rounded off to 
₹52,31,000/-. The appellant will be entitled to get interest on the 
enhanced compensation at the rate of 6% as awarded by the High 
Court. 
23. 
 
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in the aforesaid terms 
while modifying the order of the High Court. Pending interlocutory 
applications (if any) shall stand disposed of.
