Challenge in the present appeals is to the orders1 passed by

2 High Court of Judicature at Allahabad 

Abdullah, Nasir and Muzammil were granted bail by the High Court. The 
challenge has been made by the informant. 
3. 
 
The private Respondents herein are accused in FIR No. 0359 
dated 15.10.2022 registered at Gambhirpur, Aazamgarh under Sections 
147, 148, 149, 302, 336, 427 of IPC, registered on account of murder of 
Khursheed Ahmad. 
3.1 
 
In, 
initially respondent no.2/Abdullah filed bail application before the Trial 
Court, which was rejected vide order dated 16.02.2023. Thereafter, he 
moved the bail application before the High Court, which was allowed vide 
impugned order dated 28.03.2023. The ground raised was that one of the 
co-accused/Neyaz Ahmad had been enlarged on bail by the High Court 
vide order dated 22.02.20233. 
3.2 
 
In, 
the respondent no.2/Nasir filed bail application before the High Court, 
which was allowed vide impugned order dated 07.04.2023. The ground 
 
3 Passed in 

raised was that one of the co-accused/Abdullah has been enlarged on bail 
by the High Court vide order dated 28.03.20234. 
3.3 
 
In the, the respondent no.2/Muzammil filed bail application 
before the High Court, which was allowed vide impugned order dated 
14.12.2023. The ground raised was that general allegations of assaulting 
the deceased have been made against all the accused persons and no 
specific role has been assigned to the respondent no.2/Muzammil. 
4. 
 
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that when the bail 
was granted to the respondent-Abdullah he had merely undergone 
imprisonment for 4 months and 19 days; the respondent-Nasir had 
undergone imprisonment for 5 months and 11 days; and respondent-
Muzammil had undergone imprisonment for 1 year and 2 months. They 
are accused of a serious offence of the murder of Khursheed Ahmad. The 
High Court did not even refer to the arguments of the respondent 
no.1/State. Bail was granted to the respondent/Abdullah merely 
referring to the fact that another accused/Neyaz Ahmad had been granted 
 
4 Subject to challenge in 

bail by the High Court. Bail was granted to the respondent/Nasir 
referring to the order passed in the case of Abdullah. In the case of the 
respondent/Muzammil, the facts were not considered in detail. It was 
only recorded that he claimed himself to be innocent and ready to abide 
by any conditions. Despite objection by the State counsel, bail was 
granted to the said respondents. There is clear involvement of the said 
respondents in the crime to which the appellant was an eyewitness. 
5. 
 
The appellant, who is informant in the case registered on 
account of death of his elder brother was threatened of dire 
consequences by the accused-Abdullah for which he had filed a 
complaint dated 16.01.2023 with the Chief Minister of the State. It was also 
argued that the bail granted to the co-accused/Neyaz Ahmad was 
cancelled by this Court vide order dated 28.04.20235. 
6. 
 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents 
(Abdullah, Nasir and Muzammil) submitted that it is a case in which the 
appellant had falsely implicated the said respondents. Their further 
incarceration during the pendency of the matter will amount to injustice 
 
5 Passed in 

to them. There is no error in the orders passed by the High Court and the 
appeals deserve to be dismissed. 
7. 
 
After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, in our 
opinion the orders passed by the High Court deserve to be set aside. The 
respondents (Abdullah, Nasir and Muzammil) were allegedly involved in 
the heinous crime of the murder of Khursheed Ahmad on a very paltry 
issue. The respondent/Abdullah was granted bail by the High Court after 
custody of 4 months and 19 days merely noticing that another 
accused/Neyaz Ahmad had been granted bail by the High Court; 
respondent/Nasir was granted bail by the High Court after custody of 5 
months and 11 days noticing the fact that another accused/Abdullah had 
been granted bail; and respondent/Muzammil was granted bail after 
custody of 1 year and 2 months without considering the relevant material 
on record. The respondents (Abdullah, Nasir and Muzammil) were 
specifically named in the FIR. The bail to the said respondents was 
granted without even noticing the facts in detail. The post-mortem report 
suggests that the deceased was severely assaulted. His ribs were 

fractured and the injuries caused to the deceased were sufficient to cause 
his death. 
7.1. 
The reasons for cancellation of the bail, granted by the High 
Court to the co-accused Neyaz Ahmad, by this Court as per order dated 
28.04.2023 also assume relevance in the context of the challenge made 
against the impugned orders. Proprio vigore such reasons will apply in 
the case of the orders impugned in the captioned appeals as well. 
8. 
 
Considering the aforesaid factual matrix, in our opinion, the 
impugned orders cannot be legally sustained, the same are accordingly 
set aside. Resultantly, the appeals are allowed. 
9. 
 
In view of the above, the bail granted to the respondents 
(Abdullah, Nasir and Muzammil) is cancelled. They are directed to 
surrender to custody before the concerned Trial Court within 10 days 
from today. 
10. 
 
We make it clear that nothing, as noticed above, shall be taken 
as observation of this Court on merits of the controversy. The arguments 
have been noticed only for the purpose of decision of the case in hand. 
The respondents (Abdullah, Nasir and Muzammil) shall be at liberty to 

move fresh application for bail at any appropriate stage, which shall be 
considered on its own merits.
