Judgment 
and 
Order 
dated

whereby was allowed and the 
Mumbai Municipal Corporation has filed Civil Appeal 
No.9711/2024 Special Leave Petition (Civil) 
No.10430 of 2020; 
iii) Judgment 
dated 
20.10.2022 
whereby 
Writ 
Petition 
No.411/2013 was allowed and the Mumbai Municipal 
Corporation has filed arising 
out of. 
1.1 Thus, there are sets of judgments and orders of the 
Bombay High Court which have been considered together owing 
to their similarity. 
1.2 The High Court considered the writ petitions on the issue 
concerning the implementation of the decision of this Court in 
Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Company Limited vs. State 
of Maharashtra, (2009) (“Godrej & Boyce I”). The 

said decision dealt with Regulation 34 read with Para 6 of 
Appendix-VII to the Development Control Regulations for 
Greater Bombay, 1991 (“the DCR” for short). 
Relevant facts: 
2. 
With regard to the order dated 18.12.2018, the writ 
petitioners before the High Court (appellants herein) were 
holding plots of land shown as reserved in the sanctioned 
development plan under the provisions of the Maharashtra 
Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 (“MRTP Act” for short) 
which were reserved for Development Plan Road (“DP Road” for 
short). According to the writ petitioners, they constructed DP 
Roads at their own cost and voluntarily surrendered the 
reserved lands to the Mumbai Municipal Corporation. In lieu 
thereof, in terms of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 126 
of the MRTP Act read with Regulations 33 and 34 as well as 
Para 5 of Appendix-VII of DCR, the writ petitioners were 
granted Floor Space Index (“FSI” for short) and/or Transferrable 
Development Rights (“TDR” for short) in the form of 
Development Rights Certificates (“DRC” for short) equal to the 

gross area of the plots surrendered by them. Para 6 of 
Appendix-VII (as it stood prior to its amendment) provided that 
when an owner or a lessee also develops or constructs the 
amenities on the surrendered plot at his own cost and hands 
over the developed/constructed amenity to the Municipal 
Commissioner, he is entitled to DRC in the form of FSI or TDR 
equivalent to the area of construction/development done by 
him. The expression “amenity” has been defined in sub-section 
(2) of Section 2 of the MRTP Act as well as clause (7) of 
Regulation 3 of DCR. 
2.1 For the purpose of implementation of the DCR, two 
Circulars were issued on 09.04.1996 and 05.04.2003. By 
Circular dated 09.04.1996, the DRC equivalent to 15% area of 
the DP Road constructed by the owner or lessee on the 
surrendered plot was to be provided when the owner or lessee 
surrendered the developed amenity together with the reserved 
plot. By Circular dated 05.04.2003, the figure was enhanced to 
25%. 

2.2 In Godrej & Boyce I, this Court held that the expression 
“equivalent” in Para 6 of Appendix-VII would entitle the owner 
or lessee to 100% FSI or TDR for the construction of an amenity 
at his cost. Therefore, FSI or TDR for construction of an 
amenity would not be confined to 15% or 25% of DP Road area 
and it would be equivalent to 100% of the area of the road 
constructed by the owner or the lessee. 
2.3 The grievance of the writ petitioners before the High Court 
was that the Mumbai Municipal Corporation had declined to 
grant 100% additional TDR equivalent to the area of the 
amenity developed. By a notification issued on 16.11.2016, 
Regulation 34 of the DCR was amended. As a result, Appendix-
VII was virtually obliterated from the DCR. The notification 
dated 16.11.2016 was assailed and question arose as to 
whether the modifications made by the notification amending 
Regulation 34 of the DCR would have retrospective or 
retroactive operation. 
2.4 The High Court made a brief reference to the facts of each 
of the writ petitions and considered the detailed submissions 

made on behalf of the writ petitioners, the Mumbai Municipal 
Corporation and the State Government. 
Contentions before the High Court: 
3. 
It was contended on behalf of the writ petitioners before 
the High Court that the unamended Regulation 33(1) of the 
DCR enabled the owner of the land to seek benefit of FSI of the 
land reserved for DP Road and utilize the same on the 
remaining land. Till 17.06.2010, there was no entitlement to 
seek FSI under Regulation 33 for construction of an amenity 
and the amenity TDR was available only under Regulation 34 
read with Para 6 of Appendix-VII. The amendment made on 
17.06.2010 to Regulation 33 resulted in the owner, who had 
constructed the road, instead of TDR, to opt for FSI to be 
utilized on the remainder of the land. He would then be entitled 
to an extent of 25% of the FSI. But if the owner constructed an 
amenity but did not avail FSI benefit on the remainder land, the 
benefit was separated from the land and given in the form of 
TDR under Regulation 34 read with Para 6 of Appendix-VII. 
That Para 6 of Appendix-VII was not amended as such on 

17.06.2010 after the decision of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I 
as no amendment was carried out as such. However, by the 
notification dated 16.11.2016, the entire Regulation 34 and 
Appendix-VII were substituted. As per the amended provision, 
the owner was eligible to obtain TDR for the land at the rate 
mentioned in Para 4.1 of the amended Regulations as the owner 
who developed the amenity thereon became eligible to receive 
TDR in terms of Para 4.2 but by this, Regulation 33(1) did not 
undergo any amendment. 
3.1 It was contended that the aforesaid amendment should be 
construed to be prospective as otherwise it would apply to cases 
where amenity was developed and surrendered earlier, and 
hence would be unconstitutional. It was pointed out that 
subsequent to the judgment of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I, 
in the case of Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay vs. 
Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd.,, (“Natwar Parikh”) this Court had rejected the prayer of 
the Mumbai Municipal Corporation to revisit the decision in the 
case of Godrej & Boyce I and had also rejected the prayer for 

declaring that the said judgment would have only a prospective 
effect. In the said case, this Court had also rejected an 
argument of delay and laches. 
3.2 It was further contended that the notification dated 
16.11.2016 could not have a retrospective effect as the decision 
of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I could not have been nullified 
by taking away the vested right conferred, without altering the 
basis of the judgment. 
3.3 It was next contended that clause (b) of sub-section (1) of 
Section 126 of the MRTP Act, which was incorporated into the 
statute book with retrospective effect from 25.03.1991, would 
imply that prior to the said date, there was no provision for 
FSI/TDR for construction of a road by the owner. That for the 
first time w.e.f. 17.06.2010, provision was made for an 
additional 25% FSI for construction of DP Road. Since a road 
falls within the definition of amenity under the DCR as well as 
MRTP Act, compensation in the form of FSI/TDR for the 
construction of an amenity as provided by the relevant DCR 
ought to have been granted to the petitioners. This was having 

regard to Regulation 34 read with Appendix-VII which is a 
complete code for grant of TDR. It was submitted that the 
scheme of an additional 100% TDR on account of construction 
of an amenity was in lieu of payment of compensation in an 
acquisition proceeding. 
3.4 The contention of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation, on 
the other hand, was that the decision of this Court in Godrej & 
Boyce I, was per incuriam as it ignored the effects of Regulation 
33 of the DCR. It was contended that if the compensation had 
been paid partly or fully by any means, TDR could not be 
granted. That in the case of the writ petitioners, the 
compensation in the form of 10% or 25% additional TDR had 
already been granted and the notification dated 16.11.2016 had 
removed the basis of the decision of this Court in Godrej & 
Boyce I and there was now a prohibition for issuance of TDR in 
favour of the persons who had already been compensated. They 
further contended that the impugned notification would apply 
even to cases pending before the High Court and the Mumbai 
Municipal Corporation as the judgment in Godrej & Boyce I 

had been nullified by the said notification. Further, there 
cannot be 100% TDR in respect of the area of the amenity 
developed, and therefore, to cure the defect, the notification 
dated 16.11.2016 was enforced and that the DCR applicable on 
the date of deciding an application for grant of development 
permission would govern the decision on the application. 
3.5 By way of reply, the writ petitioners contended before the 
High Court that the notification dated 16.11.2016 was not a 
validating Act. It was merely a delegated legislation which could 
not nullify the judgment of the Apex Court. The right to claim 
TDR on the development of the amenity vests in the owner the 
moment 
the 
permission 
is 
granted 
by 
the 
Municipal 
Corporation to construct the road/amenity. The judgment in 
Godrej & Boyce I is not per incuriam and had been applied in 
other subsequent cases. The object of giving a benefit under 
Regulation 34 is owing to lack of financial capacity of the 
Municipal Corporation to construct amenities by itself. Hence, 
the writ petitioners sought relief under Regulation 34 of the 
DCR. 

Consideration by the High Court: 
4. 
On a consideration of the rival submissions and taking 
note of the fact that the contention of the Mumbai Municipal 
Corporation was that the decision of this Court in Godrej & 
Boyce I was per incuriam, the High Court considered the 
provisions of the Act and the Regulations in extenso. The High 
Court noted that in almost all the cases the action of 
surrendering the land and developing the amenities had been 
completed by 17.06.2010 when Regulation 33 underwent an 
amendment. Therefore, on a consideration of the erstwhile 
Regulation 33, the High Court observed that the same was 
applicable to a case where the owner, including a lessee, had 
surrendered the land or area required for road widening or for 
construction of a new road proposed under the development 
plan or those proposed under the Mumbai Municipal 
Corporation Act, 1888 (“the Act of 1888” for short). Thus, it 
would apply to the lands reserved in the development plan for 
construction of new roads or for road widening and also to the 
lands which were within the road-line as fixed under the Act of 

1888 on which a road had not yet been constructed. The said 
provision was not applicable to any other amenity. It was 
further observed that a part of FSI could be used on the plot 
remaining after such surrender and the balance FSI was to be 
permitted to be utilised as TDR by issuing DRC. Such TDR was 
to be governed by Regulation 34 as that is the provision for 
grant of TDR. Thereafter, the road and land would stand 
transferred in the city survey record in the name of the Mumbai 
Municipal Corporation and vest in the Corporation. 
4.1 Reference was then made to Regulation 34 and Appendix-
VII, which deals with TDR. The concept of TDR is that FSI 
available in respect of one plot of land could be permitted to be 
utilised on another plot of land. Para 6 of Appendix-VII dealt 
with a case where the owner or lessee developed or constructed 
the amenity on the surrendered land. In such a case, it was 
relatable to clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 126 of the 
MRTP Act. The said Act defines “amenity” under sub-section (2) 
of Section 2 of the MRTP Act, as also in clause (7) of Regulation 
3 of the DCR. The High Court observed that Regulation 33(1) 

gave effect to clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 126 of the 
MRTP Act. That Para 5 of Appendix-VII pertains to the extent of 
TDR to be granted against the surrender of a reserved land. 
Para 5 of Appendix-VII is significant inasmuch as it deals with a 
case where the owner or lessee develops or constructs an 
amenity on the surrendered plot at his own cost subject to such 
stipulation 
as 
may 
be 
prescribed 
by 
the 
Municipal 
Commissioner. That the expression ‘amenity’ would include a 
road and the construction or development of the road would 
have to be at the cost of the owner. In such an event, under 
Para 6 of Appendix-VII, the grant of additional FSI in the form 
DRC is equivalent to the area of construction/development 
done by the owner as per the stipulations prescribed by the 
Commissioner. This is like a compensation granted for 
construction of an amenity as provided in clause (b) of sub-
section (1) of Section 126 of the Act. 
4.2 The High Court again considered the argument of the 
Mumbai Municipal Corporation made before this Court to the 
effect that the value of the amenity developed or constructed by 

the owner for which an additional TDR was sought must be 
commensurate to the value of the amenity and not the area of 
the amenity, which argument had been repelled by this Court 
in Godrej & Boyce I. Thus, the High Court on considering the 
judgment of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I observed that the 
additional TDR was required to be granted as per DCR and in 
particular Para 6 of Appendix-VII equivalent to the area 
constructed or developed and not on the basis of the value of 
the development of the amenity. Hence, the High Court 
observed that when a land which is reserved in the 
development plan under the MRTP Act for a public purpose is 
surrendered by the owner or lessee free of cost and the amenity 
is developed thereon, on its surrender, the owner or lessee will 
be entitled to FSI/TDR equivalent to the area of the 
surrendered land and an additional TDR equivalent to the area 
of the amenity developed or constructed by him. 
4.3 While considering the arguments on behalf of the Mumbai 
Municipal Corporation with regard to Regulation 33, the High 
Court observed that the said Regulation provided that only a 

part of the land FSI can be used on the remaining portion of the 
land and the balance FSI had to be provided in the form of 
TDR, as per Appendix-VII. That Appendix-VII read with 
Regulation 34 dealt only with grant of TDR and the conditions 
on which TDR can be granted. Even the TDR available in terms 
of the Regulation 33(1) will be governed by Regulation 34 read 
with Appendix-VII. This is particularly so, as per Para 5 of 
Appendix-VII which applied to the grant of TDR in respect of 
land covered by Regulation 33(1). That Para 6 of Appendix-VII 
dealt with both situations, i.e., where the entire land held by 
the owner or lessee was reserved or a part thereof was reserved 
and the land was surrendered to the Corporation. Para 6 also 
dealt with grant of an additional TDR for construction of an 
amenity in terms of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 126 
of the MRTP Act. Regulation 33(1) dealt with FSI or TDR in lieu 
of surrender of land required for roads whereas Para 6 of 
Appendix-VII dealt with the grant of FSI or TDR in respect of 
the road developed at the cost of the owner or the lessee. That 

this Court in Godrej & Boyce I had considered Regulation 33 
also. 
4.4 Considering Regulation 33 which had undergone an 
amendment on 17.06.2010, the High Court observed that prior 
to the amendment, the said Regulation did not deal with FSI or 
TDR in lieu of the construction of road. It dealt with only FSI or 
TDR against the surrender of land reserved for road. However, 
after amendment, when a road constructed as per the 
stipulation of the Commissioner was handed over to the 
Commissioner free of cost, an initial FSI equivalent to 25% of 
the area of construction of road can be granted. A part of the 
FSI can be consumed on the remaining land and the remaining 
part of the FSI will be provided in the form of TDR. Therefore, 
the amendment to Regulation 33(1) was applicable to 
reservation of road and not for any other amenity. It was also 
clarified that the amendment will not apply where the FSI 
granted in lieu of road had been utilized and full occupation 
certificate had been granted prior to 17.06.2010. Therefore, 
after 17.06.2010, in case of a land reserved for road or road 

widening which was surrendered, if the amenity being a road 
had been constructed by the owner on the land surrendered, 
the additional FSI as provided in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of 
Section 126 of the MRTP Act will be 25% of the area of the 
construction of road. Hence, Para 6 of Appendix-VII to 
Regulation 34 would apply and the owner or the lessee will not 
get TDR equivalent to entire area of the road constructed by 
him but it will be confined to 25% of the area. 
4.5 It was clarified that pursuant to notification dated 
16.11.2016, Para 4.2 of the Schedule to the notification would 
be the only clause applicable to the grant of TDR against 
construction of amenity and that from 16.11.2016, Para 6 of 
Appendix-VII would not apply to the lands with amenity 
surrendered after that date. In other words, Regulation 34 
stands substituted by the Schedule to the said notification. It 
was further observed by the High Court that the said 
notification dated 16.11.2016 did not have a retrospective 
operation and it also did not take away the basis of the decision 
in Godrej & Boyce I. 

4.6 It was further clarified by the High Court that in the case 
of Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra, 
2014 SCC Online Bom 495 (“Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. 
Ltd.”), 25% TDR was granted to the petitioner therein in the 
year 2006-2007. Subsequent to the decision of this Court in 
Godrej & Boyce I, the petitioner therein had filed a petition. 
On the facts of the case in Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd., it 
was observed that there was no delay or laches. The said 
decision of the High Court was sustained by this Court in Civil 
Appeal No.1748 of 2015. This Court had also rejected the 
argument that the judgment in Godrej & Boyce I should apply 
prospectively. 
4.7 Finally, it was held that additional FSI or TDR in terms of 
Para 6 of Appendix-VII as well as in terms of clause (1) of 
Regulation 33 becomes available on surrender of the land 
reserved with or without amenity, as the case may be. After 
17.06.2010, if there is surrender of land reserved for road or 
road widening on which road is constructed by the owner or 
lessee, the FSI or TDR will be available in respect of amenity of 

road as per Regulation 33(1) as amended. Therefore, the right 
to get FSI or TDR accrues at the time of surrender. 
4.8 Thereafter, the High Court went into the facts of each of 
the writ petitions. Accordingly, the High Court passed the 
following order: 
i) 
We hold that the notification dated 16th November 
2016 is legal and valid. However, the said 
notification 
will 
not 
have 
retrospective 
or 
retroactive application to a land reserved under the 
development plan which is surrendered and 
amenity is developed on the said land by the owner 
or lessee thereof at his own cost prior to 16th 
November 2016. Such cases will be governed by 
the Regulation 33(1) and clauses (5) and 6 of 
Appendix VII. In case of a land reserved for a road, 
either in development plan under the MRTP Act or 
under the provisions of the said Act of 1888 and 
surrender is made and road is developed on or 
after 17th June 2010 but before 16th November 
2016, the FSI or TDR in lieu of amenity will be 
governed by the Regulation 33(1) as amended on 
17th June 2010. ii) 
We reject the argument that the decision of the 
Apex Court in the case of Godrej & Boyce 
Manufacturing Company Limited (supra) is per 
incuriam. iii) We hold that whether the writ jurisdiction of this 
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India 
can be allowed to be invoked on the basis of the 
said decision or not depends upon the facts of each 

case and the conduct of the petitioners especially 
the delay and laches on their part; 
 
iv) is allowed. We direct 
the 
third 
respondent-MMRDA 
to 
make 
recommendation 
to 
the 
Mumbai 
Municipal 
Corporation for grant of 75% additional FSI/TDR in 
terms of the aforesaid decision of the Apex Court 
within a period of two months from today. The 
Municipal Corporation shall examine the said 
recommendation 
and 
if 
the 
petitioners 
are 
otherwise entitled to TDR for amenity in terms of 
the aforesaid decision of the Apex Court, necessary 
DRC shall be issued within a period of two months 
from the date on which recommendation of 
MMRDA is received. v) 
 is rejected; 
 
vi) In, the petitioners 
will be entitled to additional 100% amenity FSI in 
terms of the aforesaid decision of the Apex Court 
provided by producing the documents, they satisfy 
the Mumbai Municipal Corporation that work was 
actually carried out by them for developing the 
recreation grounds and the ground; 
 
vii) is rejected. viii) is rejected. ix) is rejected. x) 
 is rejected. xi) is rejected. xii) is rejected. xiii) is rejected. xiv) is partly allowed. We 
direct the Mumbai Municipal Corporation to grant 
additional FSI in respect of amenity of road as 
provided by Regulation 33(1) as amended with 
effect from 17th June 2010. xv) We make it clear that wherever we have held that 
the petitioners are entitled to 100% amenity TDR in 
accordance with clause 6 of Appendix VII in terms 
of the aforesaid decision of the Apex Court, the 
Mumbai 
Municipal Corporation 
will 
have 
to 
examine whether the petitioners are otherwise 
eligible for grant of TDR.” 

4.9 Out of all the writ petitions disposed of, Writ Petition 
No.203 of 2014 was allowed and a direction was issued to the 
MMRDA to make recommendations to Mumbai Municipal 
Corporation for grant of 75% additional FSI/TDR in terms of 
the decision of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I within two 
months from the said date of disposal. A further direction was 
issued to Mumbai Municipal Corporation to consider the said 
recommendation and to pass orders for issuance of DRC within 
a 
period 
of 
two 
months 
from 
the 
date 
on 
which 
recommendation of MMRDA was received, provided the writ 

petitioner was otherwise entitled to TDR for amenity in terms of 
the judgment of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I. 
4.10 Similarly, in, additional 
FSI to the extent of 100% on amenity was granted in terms of 
the decision of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I provided the 
writ petitioner therein produced the documents and satisfied 
the Mumbai Municipal Corporation that work was actually 
carried out for developing the recreation grounds and ground. 
4.11 was partly allowed to the 
effect that Mumbai Municipal Corporation ought to grant 
additional FSI in respect of amenity of road as provided by 
Regulation 33(1) as amended with effect from 17.06.2010. It 
was also observed that the petitioners therein are entitled to 
100% amenity TDR in accordance with Para 6 of Appendix-VII 
in terms of the aforesaid decision of this Court in Godrej & 
Boyce I and Mumbai Municipal Corporation was to examine 
whether the petitioners therein were otherwise eligible for grant 
of TDR. 

4.12 With regard to those cases which were dismissed on the 
ground of delay and laches, appeals have been filed by the 
private petitioners therein. Appeal has been filed by Mumbai 
Municipal Corporation against the order in writ petition No.203 
of 2014 but no appeal has been filed against the order in Writ 
Petition Nos.2262/2010 and 1860/2017. 
There are two more impugned judgments in Writ Petition 
Nos.2531/2009 and 411/2013 against which the Mumbai 
Municipal Corporation has filed its appeals. 
4.13 At this stage, it may be mentioned that where the writ 
petitions were dismissed by the High Court on the ground of 
delay and laches, there is no observation in those writ petitions 
denying the benefit on merits. Insofar as in three cases where 
the writ petitions were allowed, there is only one appeal filed by 
the Mumbai Municipal Corporation as the orders in Writ 
Petition No.2262 of 2010 and have 
been accepted by it. 

4.14 The details of the three cases in which appeals have been 
filed by the Mumbai Municipal Corporation are noted as 
under:- 

WP No.2531 of 2009 – Starwing Developers 
Private Limited vs. Municipal Corporation of 
Greater Mumbai - disposed of on 18.10.2019 
(ii) WP No.203 of 2014 – Apurva Natvar Parikh 
and Co. Private Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra 
and Others - disposed of on 18.12.2018 
(iii) WP No.411 of 2013 – Arvind Kashinath 
Dadarkar 
and 
Others 
vs. 
Municipal 
Corporation of Greater Mumbai and Others – 
disposed of on 20.10.2022. 
Starwing Developers Private Limited: 
5. 
In Starwing Developers Private Limited vs. State of 
Maharashtra (“Starwing Developers Private Limited”), Writ 
Petition No.2531 of 2009 disposed by the High Court on 
18.10.2019, unamended Regulation 33 and Regulation 34 as 

they stood prior to 2010 were considered in depth. It was 
observed that Regulation 34 as it stood at the relevant time 
provided that in certain circumstances, the development 
potential of a plot of land could be separated from the land 
itself and could be made available to the owner of the land in 
the form of TDR which would be subjected to Regulation 34 and 
Appendix-VII. 
It 
was 
observed 
that 
Appendix-VII 
titled 
“Regulations for the grant of Transferable Development Rights 
(TDRs) to owners/developers and conditions for grant of such 
rights” had a scheme for the award of TDR to the owner of the 
plot of land which was reserved for public purpose and for 
additional amenities in the form of FSI. As per the conditions 
set out therein, such award would entitle the owner of the land 
to FSI in the form of DRC which he could use for himself or 
transfer to any other person. Para 5 of the Appendix provided 
that the built-up area for the purposes of FSI credited in the 
form of DRC shall be equal to the gross area of the reserved plot 
to be surrendered and will proportionately increase or decrease 
according to the permissible FSI of the zone where the TDR has 

originated. Para 6 provided that when an owner or a lessee also 
developed or constructed an amenity on the surrendered plot at 
his own cost, subject to such stipulations which may be 
prescribed and to the satisfaction thereof and hands over the 
developed or constructed amenity to the Commissioner or the 
appropriate authority free of cost, he would be granted further 
DR 
in 
the 
form 
of 
FSI 
equivalent 
to 
the 
area 
of 
construction/development done by him, utilisation of which 
would be subject to the regulations contained in the said 
Appendix. 
5.1 Contrasting Regulation 34 with Regulation 33, it was 
observed that the latter pertained to additional FSI which may 
be allowed to certain categories. Sub-regulation (1) as it stood 
at the relevant time, provided that the Commissioner could 
permit the additional FSI on 100% of the area required for road 
widening or for construction of new roads under the 
development plan. Such FSI so surrendered would be utilisable 
on the remainder of the land up to a limit of 40% in respect of 
the plots situated in Mumbai city and 80% in respect of the 

plots situated in suburbs and extended suburbs. The balance 
FSI remaining thereafter was allowed to be utilised as a 
development right in accordance with the regulations governing 
TDRs. In the said case, it was again contended on behalf of the 
Mumbai Municipal Corporation that the petitioner therein 
having utilised 100% FSI for surrender of land without cost on 
the same layout, was governed by Regulation 33 and therefore, 
could not claim any additional FSI/TDR for having constructed 
the amenities. This contention, in fact, was squarely identical 
to those in the case of Apurva Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd 
which case is discussed later. 
5.2 It was pointed out that till the amendment on 17.06.2010, 
there was no provision in Regulation 33 for claiming FSI for 
construction of amenities and the same could be claimed only 
in terms of Regulation 34 read with Para 6 of Appendix-VII. On 
the other hand, it was contended by the Municipal Corporation 
that Regulation 33 was not brought to the notice of this Court 
in Godrej & Boyce I and that by notification dated 16.11.2016 
the Regulation was amended to restrict the benefit of additional 

TDR for development of amenities which was to cure a defect in 
the legislation. The said contention was considered in light of 
the amendment to Regulation 33 with effect from 17.06.2010, 
by which a clause was added to sub-regulation (1) and it was 
observed that the amendment to Regulation 33(1) was 
applicable to roads and not to any other amenity. Moreover, 
this portion of the amendment would not apply where the FSI 
granted in lieu of road is utilised and full occupation certificate 
was granted prior to 17.06.2010. Therefore, from 17.06.2010 in 
case of a land reserved for road or road widening which was 
surrendered, if the amenity of the road was constructed by the 
owner of the land surrendered, the additional FSI as provided 
in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 126 will be 25% from 
the area of the construction of the road. Therefore, for such 
amenity, in terms of Para 6 of Appendix-VII, the owner or a 
lessee will not get TDR equivalent to entire area of the road 
constructed by him. It will remain confined to 25% of the area. 
It was observed that Regulation 33(1) as amended on 

17.06.2010 was not modified by the impugned notification 
dated 16.11.2016. 
Apurva Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd.: 
6. 
In the case of Apurva Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd. vs. 
State of Maharashtra, filed 
before the High Court, the surrender of land was in the form of 
deed of conveyance and handing over of possession was in 
February, 2007 and within three years from the surrender i.e. 
February, 2010, the writ petitioner/appellant herein requested 
an officer of MMRDA to recommend to the Mumbai Municipal 
Corporation to issue 100% additional TDR in respect of 
construction of amenity. In December, 2010, DRC of 25% of the 
amenity was granted. The balance 75% had not been paid. 
Hence, the writ petition was filed in October, 2013. Actually, 
within one month from the date of decision in the case of 
Godrej and Boyce I, the petitioner applied to the respondent-
MMRDA 
for 
recommending 
to 
the 
Mumbai 
Municipal 
Corporation for grant of 100% TDR in respect of the amenity 
and the said application was acted upon and 25% FSI was 

granted in December, 2010. Therefore, the High Court held that 
conduct of the petitioner is not such that it will prevent the Writ 
Court from granting relief in terms of the decision in Godrej & 
Boyce I. 
Arvind Kashinath Dadarkar: 
7. 
In 
Arvind 
Kashinath 
Dadarkar 
vs. 
Municipal 
Corporation of Greater Mumbai, Writ Petition No.411 of 
2013 (“Arvind Kashinath Dadarkar”), disposed of on 
20.10.2022, another Division Bench of the High Court of 
Bombay while adverting to Godrej & Boyce I and Apurva 
Natvar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd., and Starwing Developers 
Private Limited, allowed the writ petition and directed that 
TDR be issued to the petitioner therein. 
Submissions: 
8. 
We have heard the arguments of the respective Senior 
Counsel and other Counsel on both sides and perused the 
material on record. 

Submissions on behalf of the Appellants: 
8.1 Learned senior counsel, Sri Pravin Samdani, contended 
that the impugned judgment dated 18.12.2018 has, in fact, 
upheld petitioners’ right to 100% additional TDR and has 
applied the judgment of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I. 
However, reliefs were declined to certain writ petitioners on the 
ground of delay and laches in claiming the additional TDR in 
time. Consequently, the writ petitions were dismissed by the 
High Court. Being aggrieved by the dismissal of the writ 
petitions, the writ petitioners before the High Court have 
preferred these appeals. Therefore, this Court may reverse the 
finding of the High Court on the issue of the delay and laches 
and grant the reliefs to these appellants as the other writ 
petitioners have been granted by the High Court. 
8.2 In this regard, it was submitted that the compensation 
payable to the landowners/lessees for acquisition of their land 
for a public purpose is, in fact, held in trust by the acquiring 
body, i.e., the Mumbai Municipal Corporation in the instant 
case. Once the compensation is determined, the same was 

payable and the reliefs could not have been denied by the High 
Court on the ground of delay or laches. In this context, reliance 
was placed on Noida Entrepreneur Association vs. NOIDA, 
(2011) (Para 38-39) (“Noida Entrepreneur 
Association”). 
8.3 It was next submitted that the State is the guardian or 
custodian and protector of the rights of the citizens. This casts 
a duty and obligation on the State to pay compensation to land 
losers for lands compulsorily acquired. The right to receive a 
fair compensation is a constitutional right guaranteed under 
Article 300A of the Constitution of India which can also be 
traced to Article 21 of the Constitution of India as a citizen 
cannot be deprived of his property, save in accordance with law. 
It was contended that the mandate of Section 126(1)(b) of the 
MRTP Act and the DCR be complied with by the respondent - 
Mumbai Municipal Corporation vis-à-vis the appellants herein. 
Otherwise, the denial of compensation would amount to 
usurping the citizens’ property without authority of law and in 
breach of the constitutional rights of the citizens. In this 

context, reliance was placed on Vidya Devi vs. State of 
Himachal Pradesh, (2020) (Para 12.9 to 12.14); 
Sukh Dutt Ratra vs. State of Himachal Pradesh, (2022) 
SCC OnLine SC 410, (Para 13-27); and Lalaram Vs. Jaipur 
Development Authority, (2016), (Para 124 & 
129); Kazi Moinuddin Kazi Bashiroddin vs. Maharashtra 
Tourism Development Corporation (2022) SCC OnLine SC 
1325, (Para 26). 
8.4 In the above backdrop, learned senior counsel, Sri Pravin 
Samdani submitted that the High Court was not right in 
dismissing the writ petitions on the ground of delay and laches 
when the respondent – Mumbai Municipal Corporation had not 
proved that: 

the delay amounted to laches; 

owing to delay and during the interregnum, the 
respondent – Mumbai Municipal Corporation had 
altered its position to its prejudice; and 

certain rights had accrued which could not be 
disturbed by grant of reliefs to the writ 
petitioners/appellants herein. 
 
In this context, reliance was placed on Moon Mills Ltd. vs. M.R. Meher, President, Industrial Court, Bombay, AIR 
1967 SC 1450, (Para 9); M/s Dehri Rohtas Light Railway 
Company Limited vs. District Board, Bhojpur, (1992) (2) 
SCC 598, (Para 13); Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. vs. Dolly Das, (1999) ] (Para 8); and Tukaram 
Kana Joshi vs. Maharashtra Industrial Development 
Corporation (2013), (Para 12); and Mohar Singh 
(Dead) Thr. LRs. vs. State of UP Collector, 2023 INSC 1019 
(Para 12). 
8.5 It was further urged that the Mumbai Municipal 
Corporation has not asserted that owing to the alleged delay on 
the part of the appellants herein in making their claim under 
Section 126(1)(b) of the MRTP Act, there was any prejudice 
caused to it. 

8.6 It was also submitted that the observations of the High 
Court in the impugned judgment that there was a waiver or an 
abandonment of their rights by the writ petitioners/appellants 
herein are contrary to the facts and law. In this regard 
reference was made to Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Co. 
Ltd. vs. Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, (2023) 
SCC OnLine SC 592, (Paras 8, 15 and 18) (“Godrej & Boyce 
II”); G.T. Lad vs. Chemical and Fibres of India Ltd., (1979), (Para 5 & 6); A.P. SRTC vs. S. Jayaram, (2004), (Para 5); and State of Punjab vs. Davinder Pal 
Singh Bhullar, (2011), (Para 37 to 42). 
8.7 Petitioners’ counsel therefore sought for allowing these 
appeals by setting aside that portion of the order of the High 
Court declining to grant relief on the ground of delay and 
laches. 
8.8 On the merits of the case, Sri Samdani submitted that 
Section 2(2) of the MRTP Act defines an amenity which is also 
defined under Regulation 3(7) of DCR. Section 126(1)(b) of 
MRTP Act provides for compulsory acquisition, wherein 

compensation is provided in the form of FSI or TDR in two 
parts: (i) for the land; and (ii) for development/construction of 
the amenity at the cost of the owner on the surrendered land in 
terms of the DCR. That Regulations 33(1) and 34 prior to their 
amendment in the year 2010 provided a mechanism for grant of 
TDR for both the first as well as the second component. This 
Court had interpreted the aforesaid provisions in the case of 
Godrej & Boyce I. This Court observed that the grant of 
additional TDR was for construction or development of the 
amenity. However, in the year 2010, there was an amendment 
which stated that in addition to the land component of 
FSI/TDR, the land owner would be entitled to receive only 
additional 25% FSI/TDR for construction of road. However, the 
additional 25% could be used as FSI on the remainder of the 
plot if the remainder of the plot could consume to the extent of 
40/80% of the remaining land after surrender. The balance 
FSI/TDR was eligible to be paid as TDR under Paras 5 and 6 of 
Appendix-VII-A and Regulation 34 of the DCR. This amendment 
of 17.06.2010 was subsequent to the judgment of this court in 

Godrej & Boyce I. However, there was no alteration to 
Regulation 34 and Paras 5 and 6 of Appendix-VII-A of the DCR. 
This amendment was in the form of delegated legislation and 
was only prospective in nature. But by the amendment of 
16.11.2016, the entire Regulation 34 and Appendix-VII-A was 
amended. As a result of the amendment, if the land owner 
desired to obtain TDR for the land component, the owner was 
eligible to do so at the rate mentioned in Para 4.1 of amended 
Regulation. If the landowner also developed the amenity, the 
owner became eligible to receive compensatory TDR in terms of 
Para 4.2 of the amended Regulation. 
8.9 According to learned senior counsel, this amendment is 
also prospective. It was further submitted that by the 
amendment of Regulation 34 of the DCR, the basis of the 
judgment in Godrej & Boyce I was not removed. The intention 
of the amendment was to grant additional compensation to the 
landowner in view of the enforcement of Right to Fair 
Compensation 
and 
Transparency 
in 
Land 
Acquisition, 
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 and not to remove 

the basis of the judgment in Godrej & Boyce I. There was no 
intention to validate any action of the Corporation of curtailing 
amenity TDR to 25% or to validate Circulars based on which it 
was sought to be curtailed to 25%. Therefore, the judgment of 
this Court in Godrej & Boyce I remains intact. 
8.10 It was further submitted that the right to receive 
compensation for acquisition is a vested right and a 
constitutional right and the same cannot be taken away by an 
amendment to the statute. 
8.11 It was next submitted that the attempt of the Mumbai 
Municipal Corporation to deny balance 75% TDR in view of the 
notification dated 16.11.2016 is unsustainable. This is because 
the writ petitioners’ right to receive the balance TDR is a vested 
right which arose under the old DCR and continues even after 
the 
amendment. 
Further, 
a 
person 
cannot 
be 
denied 
compensation by a subsequent legislation when the entitlement 
is recognized under a prior legislation. The High Court has 
rightly held that the DCR amended was prospective and not 
retrospective.

and 
thereafter WP 
filed 
on 
05.12.2009) 
 
9.1 Insofar as the appellant – M/s Kukreja Construction 
Company, it was submitted that the conditions which are 
required to be complied with for seeking compensation under 
Section 126(1)(b) of the MRTP Act have not been met and 
therefore, unless and until the said conditions are complied 
with, the said appellant would not be entitled to compensation 
under the scheme of the Act and the Regulations made 
thereunder. As far as the other appellants are concerned, he 
fairly submitted that even according to the Mumbai Municipal 
Corporation they have complied with the conditions as required 

under the scheme and therefore, their cases could be 
considered if they are otherwise eligible for compensation being 
paid to them in case they are successful in these appeals. 
9.2 Learned senior counsel also strenuously sought to 
buttress the submissions made on behalf of the Mumbai 
Municipal Corporation before the High Court regarding the 
judgment of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I, but did not 
persuade himself to do so. Ultimately, he supported the order of 
the High Court in denying the reliefs to the writ petitioners who 
had delayed in making their claims. He contended that the High 
Court was right in declining to grant the relief to the said 
parties. 
9.3 Sri Nadkarni contented that firstly, the High Court was 
right in declining relief based on the judgment of this Court in 
Godrej and Boyce I owing to delay, as those developers who 
already availed of the TDR and accepted the same without any 
protest or demur could not again agitate the matter after the 
judgement of this Court in Godrej and Boyce I. Secondly, there 
was a crystallisation of the compensation payable in the form of 

FSI/TDR as on the date of the notice of acquisition which in 
this case could be either the publication of the development 
plan or the date of preliminary notification under the 
Acquisition Act and that the owner or lessee could not have 
returned for a second helping or make an additional claim of 
100% TDR since the value of the land as on the date when the 
project was conceived or when the benefits were received would 
have been lesser than the value of the land on the date of the 
filing of the writ petition. Thirdly, any grant of additional TDR 
despite there being a delay would result in unjust enrichment 
of the owner and the lessee who could get an advantage of 
escalation in price of land which is contrary to public interest. 
Therefore, for this reason also, the High Court was justified in 
declining to grant relief on the ground of delay and laches. 
Hence, there is no merit in these appeals. 
9.4 Learned senior counsel submitted that in the event this 
Court is to condone the delay and laches and thereby modifies 
the impugned judgment of the High Court then, in the case of 
the appellants in CA No. 9702 of 2024, (Kukreja Construction 

company and others) this Court may direct that only on 
complying with the mandatory requirements could the said 
appellant avail of the benefits of additional FSI/TDR in 
accordance with law as indicated in the table above. 
9.5 Learned senior counsel, Sri Nadkarni, with reference to 
our order dated 06.08.2024, sought further instruction on 
Estate Investment Company Ltd. and Ever-smile Construction 
being granted relief of 100% of TDR rights in terms of Section 
126(1)(b) of the MRTP Act as well as the DCR. He fairly 
submitted that there is no dispute that the aforesaid two 
entities were indeed granted 100% TDR rights. Further, there 
has been no appeal filed with regard to the order of the High 
Court in and Writ Petition 
No.2262 of 2010. Learned senior counsel, Sri Nadkarni, also 
submitted that insofar as the judgment of the High Court 
assailed in Civil Appeal Nos.9711/2024 and 9712/2024, they 
may be disposed in light of the prevalent law. 

Reply arguments: 
10. By way of reply, learned senior counsel, Sri Samdani and 
other learned counsel contended that the Mumbai Municipal 
Corporation cannot be permitted to raise any contention 
contrary to the judgment of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I 
which is holding the field and there is no contention raised by 
the Municipal Corporation either before the High Court or this 
Court which can lead to a reconsideration of the said judgment. 
Hence, they sought for application of the judgment of this Court 
in Godrej & Boyce I to their cases as well. 
10.1 Learned counsel for the respondents in the three appeals 
filed by the Mumbai Municipal Corporation supported the 
impugned order passed by Bombay High Court and contented 
that having regard to the judgment of this Court in Godrej & 
Boyce I and the order passed in 
which arose from the judgment of the Bombay High Court in 
the case of Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd, there is no merit in 
these appeals. Hence, they contended that the appeals filed by 
the Mumbai Municipal Corporation may be dismissed. 

Points for consideration: 
11. In light of the aforesaid contentions, the following points 
would arise for our consideration: - 

Whether the High Court was right in declining to 
grant relief to the writ petitioners/appellants 
herein on the ground of delay and laches? 

Whether the appeals filed by the respondent-
Mumbai Municipal Corporation would call for 
any interference by this Court? 

What order? 
Godrej & Boyce I: 
12. At the outset, it would be useful to refer to the dictum of 
this Court in Godrej & Boyce I which has been followed by the 
High Court in these cases. In the said case, this Court 
considered the scheme of development rights in respect of land 
acquired for the purpose specified in plans under Section 126 
of the MRTP Act. Three modes of acquisition of land required 
for a public purpose specified in the plan are contemplated 
under Section 126 of the MRTP Act, which reads as under: 

“126. Acquisition of land required for public 
purposes specified in plans.— (1) Where after the 
publication of a draft Regional plan, a Development or 
any other plan or town planning scheme, any land is 
required or reserved for any of the public purposes 
specified in any plan or scheme under this Act at any 
time, the Planning Authority, Development Authority, 
or as the case may be, any Appropriate Authority may, 
except as otherwise provided in Section 113-A 
acquire the land,— 
(a) by agreement by paying an amount agreed to, or 
(b) in lieu of any such amount, by granting the land-
owner or the lessee, subject, however, to the lessee 
paying the lessor or depositing with the Planning 
Authority, 
Development 
Authority 
or 
Appropriate 
Authority, as the case may be, for payment to the 
lessor, an amount equivalent to the value of the lessor's 
interest to be determined by any of the said Authorities 
concerned on the basis of the principles laid down in 
the Right and Fair Compensation and Transparency in 
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 
2013, 
Floor 
Space 
Index 

or 
Transferable 
Development Rights (TDR) against the area of land 
surrendered 
free 
of 
cost 
and 
free 
from 
all 
encumbrances, and also further additional Floor Space 
Index or Transferable Development Rights against the 
development or construction of the amenity on the 
surrendered land at his cost, as the Final Development 
Control Regulations prepared in this behalf provide, or 
(c) by making an application to the State Government 
for acquiring such land under the provisions of the 
Right and Fair Compensation and Transparency in 
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 

2013, and the land (together with the amenity, if any so 
developed or constructed) so acquired by agreement or 
by grant of Floor Space Index or additional Floor Space 
Index or Transferable Development Rights under this 
section or under the provisions of the Right and Fair 
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, 
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, as the case 
may 
be, 
shall 
vest 
absolutely 
free 
from 
all 
encumbrances in the Planning Authority, Development 
Authority, or as the case may be, any Appropriate 
Authority. 
(2) On receipt of such application, if the State 
Government is satisfied that the land specified in the 
application is needed for the public purpose therein 
specified, or if the State Government (except in cases 
falling under Section 49 and except as provided in 
Section 113-A) itself is of opinion that any land 
included in any such plan is needed for any public 
purpose, it may make a declaration to that effect in 
the Official Gazette, in the manner provided in Section 
19 Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in 
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 
2013, in respect of the said land. The declaration so 
published shall, notwithstanding anything contained in 
the said Act, be deemed to be a declaration duly made 
under the said section: 
Provided that, subject to the provisions of sub-
section (4), no such declaration shall be made after the 
expiry of one year from the date of publication of the 
draft Regional Plan, Development Plan or any other 
Plan, or Scheme, as the case may be. 
(3) On publication of a declaration under the said 
Section 19, the Collector shall proceed to take order for 
the acquisition of the land under the said Act; and the 

provisions of that Act shall apply to the acquisition of 
the said land with the modification that the market 
value of the land shall be,— 
(i) where the land is to be acquired for the purposes of a 
new town, the market value prevailing on the date of 
publication of the notification constituting or declaring 
the Development Authority for such town; 
(ii) where the land is acquired for the purposes of a 
Special Planning Authority, the market value prevailing 
on the date of publication of the notification of the area 
as undeveloped area; and 
(iii) in any other case, the market value on the date of 
publication of the interim development plan, the draft 
development plan or the plan for the area or areas for 
comprehensive development, whichever is earlier, or as 
the case may be, the date of publication of the draft 
Town Planning Scheme: 
Provided that, nothing in this sub-section shall affect 
the date for the purpose of determining the market 
value of land in respect of which proceedings for 
acquisition commenced before the commencement of 
the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (Second 
Amendment) Act, 1972: 
Provided further that, for the purpose of clause (ii) of 
this sub-section, the market value in respect of land 
included in any undeveloped area notified under sub-
section (1) of Section 40 prior to the commencement of 
the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (Second 
Amendment) Act, 1972, shall be the market value 
prevailing on the date of such commencement. 
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the proviso 
to sub-section (2) and sub-section (3), if a declaration, 

is not made, within the period referred to in sub-
section (2) (or having been made, the aforesaid period 
expired on the commencement of the Maharashtra 
Regional and Town Planning (Amendment) Act, 1993, 
the State Government may make a fresh declaration for 
acquiring the land under the provisions of the Right 
and Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land 
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, 
in the manner provided by sub-sections (2) and (3) of 
this section, subject to the modification that the market 
value of the land shall be the market value at the date 
of declaration in the Official Gazette, made for acquiring 
the land afresh.” 
 
In this case, we are concerned with Section 126(1)(b) of the 
MRTP Act. 
12.1 Under Section 126(1) of the MRTP Act, when land is 
required or reserved for any of the public purposes specified in 
any plan or scheme under the Act at any time, the Planning 
Authority, the Development Authority, or as the case may 
be, any Appropriate Authority may acquire the land by 
agreement by paying an amount agreed to landowner or lessee 
[Section 126(1)(a)]; the second mode is, in lieu of any such 
amount as mentioned above, by granting the landowner or the 
lessee, subject, however, to the lessee paying the lessor or 

depositing with the Planning Authority, the Development 
Authority or Appropriate Authority, as the case may be, for 
payment to the lessor, an amount equivalent to the value of the 
lessor's interest to be determined by any of the said Authorities 
concerned on the basis of the principles laid down in the Land 
Acquisition Act, 1894, Floor Space Index (FSI) or Transferable 
Development Rights (TDR): 

against the area of land surrendered free of cost and free 
from all encumbrances, and also 
(ii) further additional FSI or TDR against the development or 
construction of the amenity on the surrendered land at his 
cost, as the Final Development Control Regulations 
prepared in that behalf provide [Section 126(1)(b)]. 
The third mode being by acquisition of the land 
under the relevant Act [Section 126(1)(c)]. 
12.2 Thus, it is open to the landowner to surrender the plot of 
land “free of cost” and “free from all encumbrances” to the 
appropriate authority who may acquire the land by granting to 

the owner FSI or TDR against the area of the surrendered land. 
The scheme further provides for additional FSI or TDR against 
the development of construction of amenities (for which the plot 
is shown reserved in the plan) by the owner at his own cost. 
12.3 In Godrej & Boyce I, the appellants therein had their 
plots covered under the development plan as reserved for roads, 
which 
they 
voluntarily 
surrendered. 
In 
addition, 
they 
constructed on their respective pieces of land the development 
plan roads at their own cost and as per the specifications 
stipulated in the relevant rules. In the said case, there was no 
dispute between the parties in regard to the FSI or TDRs 
granted to them for the surrendered plots of land. The 
controversy was with regard to the FSI or TDRs for roads 
constructed on the surrendered lands at the owner's cost. The 
landowners claimed that for constructing the roads they were 
entitled to FSI or TDRs for the whole of the surface area of the 
roads. They relied upon Para 6 of Appendix-VII to the DCRs. 
The Mumbai Municipal Corporation however relied upon a 
Circular 
dated 
09.04.1996 
issued 
by 
the 
Municipal 

Commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay, 
which envisaged a graded scheme for grant of additional 
development rights for construction of amenities by the 
landowner, e.g. in case of amenities like general hospital, 
municipal primary school, etc. which allowed FSI equal to the 
built-up area of the structure but in case of DP road only 15% 
of the area of the road surface. The Circular was assailed by 
the landowners. 
12.4 In the said case, the Bombay High Court had accepted 
the contention advanced on behalf of the State of Maharashtra 
to the effect that by introducing a graded scheme for grant of 
additional FSI or TDR the Circular had eliminated the 
possibility of any discriminatory or arbitrary action on the part 
of the authority competent to issue the development right 
certificate. It was contended that grant of further additional 
TDR 
was 
commensurate 
to 
the value of 
the 
amenity 
constructed/developed on the surrendered land. Therefore, it 
was contended that Para 6 of the Appendix-VII, unlike Para 5 
didn't use the words “equal to the gross area of the reserved 

plot” or “equal in area”. Instead, Para 6 used the words 
“equivalent to the area of construction/development”. That, 
Para 6 of Appendix-VII to the Regulations must be read with 
Section 126(1)(b) of the Act. It was evident that the said 
provision used the words “against the area of the land 
surrendered” and “against the development or construction of 
amenity on the surrendered land”. Therefore, the grant of 
additional development right was proportionate to the value of 
the amenity constructed by the owner at his own cost and the 
Circular issued by the Municipal Commissioner simply 
quantified the exchange value of different kinds of amenities in 
percentage terms depending upon their cost of construction 
and other relevant considerations. 
12.5 However, the aforesaid submission, which was accepted 
by the Bombay High Court was not agreed to by this Court and 
the judgment of the Bombay High Court was set-aside. While 
doing so, the submission on behalf of the appellants therein 
was accepted that the provision clearly envisaged grant of the 
FSI or TDR under two separate heads: one, for the land, and 

the other, for the construction of the amenity for which the land 
was designated in the development plan at the cost of the 
owner. The Court also held that Section 2(9-A) defined 
“development right” to include TDR and Section 126(1)(b) 
provided for: 

grant of FSI or TDR against the area of land 
surrendered free of cost, and 

further, additional FSI or TDR against the 
development or construction of the amenity on 
the surrendered land at the owner's cost as the 
final Development Control Regulations should 
provide. 
12.6 In the case of (i) above, FSI or TDR would be equal to the 
gross area of the surrendered plot, and for (ii) above i.e. for 
construction of the amenity, the extent of the FSI or TDR would 
be equivalent to the area of the construction/development 
made on the land. 

12.7 That Regulation 34 made provisions for transferability of 
the development rights and Appendix-VII referred to in 
Regulation 34 provided for the extent of FSI or TDR admissible 
under the two heads. That the expression “equivalent to the 
area” of the construction or development made on the 
surrendered land in Para 6 of Appendix-VII would mean 
“equivalent to the area of construction/development”, that is to 
say, the additional DR would be the same in area as the 
amenity constructed/developed on the surrendered land. 
Hence, there cannot be a differentiation in the grant of 
additional TDR on a variable and sliding scale on the 
surrendered land for amenities constructed on the basis of the 
Circular issued by the Municipal Commissioner. Also, the 
Circular cannot override the provisions of the Regulations. It 
was further observed that the expressions “against the area of 
the land surrendered free of cost” and “against the development 
or construction of amenity on the surrendered land” would mean 
“in exchange for, in return for; as an equivalent or set-off for; in 
lieu of, instead of”. Section 126(1)(b) was a recompense to the 

landowner proportionate to the area of development or 
construction of the amenity on the surrendered land. Thus, in 
Para 5 of Appendix-VII to the Regulations, the expression 
“equal to the gross area of reserved plot” was relatable to the 
bare land and in Para 6 of the Appendix, the expression 
“equivalent to the area of the construction/development” would 
mean that “the area of construction or development” is the 
measure of equivalence. Therefore, there could be no other 
basis for determining the equivalence. Hence, the Circular was 
held to be without authority of law. 
Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd.: 
13. Prior to the impugned judgments of the High Court, in 
Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd., a writ petition was filed before 
the Bombay High Court seeking a direction for grant of 
additional TDR/development rights certificate (DRC) for the 
balance 75% area as set out in the Schedules annexed to the 
writ petitions. In that case also, admittedly, the respondents 
therein had been granted 25% TDR/DRC in lieu of the 
construction of the specified DP Road and there was no 

challenge about the actual work done at the relevant time. 
Subsequent to the judgment of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I, 
the petitioner therein filed the petition. The respondent Mumbai 
Municipal Corporation sought to deny the same on a twofold 
contention: firstly, there was delay and laches; and, secondly, 
an attempt was made to reopen the issues on facts about the 
construction of the DP Road. The same were repelled by the 
High Court by holding that already 25% TDR had been granted 
and therefore, there could be no reopening of the controversy 
on that basis and the only question which remained was the 
entitlement of the petitioner to remaining 75% TDR/DRC as 
prayed. 
13.1 A contention was also sought to be raised by the 
respondent-Corporation that the petitioner therein had not 
built upon the amenity as contemplated under Regulation 34 
Appendix-VII Paras 5 and 6. The said contention was also 
repelled by holding that the right of the petitioner has already 
been crystallised and the cause of action was a continuing one 
and hence there was no question of delay and laches. 

Consequently, a direction was issued to grant additional TDR 
for the balance 75% area. It was also observed that the issues 
which were raised in the said case had been concluded by the 
judgment of this Court in the case of Municipal Corporation 
of Greater Bombay vs. Yeshwant Jagannath Vaity, (2011) 
 (“Yeshwant Jagannath Vaity”), “for other 
amenity” also. 
13.2 In 
Civil 
Appeal 
No.1748 
of 

(Municipal 
Corporation of Greater Mumbai vs. Natwar Parikh and Co. 
Pvt. Ltd.), this Court by order dated 05.05.2016 has 
categorically observed that it was too late to re-visit the entire 
issue and to take a decision whether the judgment delivered 
earlier in Godrej & Boyce I should apply prospectively and not 
retrospectively. That is a matter which should have been 
agitated when Godrej & Boyce I was being heard. It was 
further observed that insofar as the 89 applicants who were 
then waiting to take an advantage of the aforesaid decision 
rendered by this Court, on the facts of the cases the 
applications ought to be considered and if a dispute arises the 

appropriate Court would take a decision in the matter. 
Consequently, the Civil Appeal filed by the Mumbai Municipal 
Corporation were dismissed. 
Godrej & Boyce II: 
14. It would be useful to refer to another decision of this Court 
in the case of Godrej & Boyce II. In the said case, two 
questions arose for consideration in the context of grant of DRC 
for a total area of 31,057.30 sq. metres, for the construction 
and development of the amenity namely, Recreation Ground. 
One of the questions considered was whether the High Court 
was right in concluding that there was an abandonment of 
claim by the appellants therein. Touching upon the facts of the 
case, this Court took note of the rejection of the claim by the 
Corporation vide communication dated 27.11.1998 for the 
grant of additional TDR made by application dated 17.04.1998; 
the resolution of the dispute of the said entity with the decision 
of this Court dated 06.02.2009 in Godrej & Boyce I (its own 
case); application being made for the grant of additional TDR on 
03.11.2009 being rejected and a fresh writ petition being filed 

in the year 2010. This Court considered the law of 
abandonment in the context of the contention raised by the 
Mumbai Municipal Corporation and it was observed in 
paragraphs 15 to 18 as under: 
“15. The law of abandonment is based upon the 
maxim invito beneficium non datur. It means that 
the law confers upon a man no rights or benefits 
which he does not desire. In P. Dasa Muni Reddy v. P. 
Appa Rao, this Court held that “abandonment of right is 
much more than mere waiver, acquiescence or laches…. 
Waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known right 
or 
advantage, 
benefit, 
claim 
or 
privilege….”. 
In 
paragraph 13 of the said decision, this Court put the 
law pithily in the following words: 
“13…. There can be no waiver of a non-
existent right. Similarly, one cannot waive 
that which is not one's as a right at the time 
of waiver. …” 
16. Irrespective of whether the respondents concede or 
not, the Circular dated 09.04.1996 curtailed the rights 
of the owners to have additional TDR in certain 
circumstances. The Circular came under challenge 
before this Court and the decision of this Court 
in Godrej 
and 
Boyce 
Manufacturing 
Company 
Limited was delivered on 06.02.2009. As we have stated 
earlier, the decision in Godrej and Boyce Manufacturing 
Company Limited was in the case of the very appellant 
No. 1 herein though in respect of some other property. 
17. To put it differently, what was cited by the 
Municipal Corporation in their order of rejection dated 
27.11.1998 as an impediment for the grant of 
additional TDR was the subject matter of challenge in 

the first round. It was made by the very appellant No. 1 
herein, though in respect of another property. If the 
said decision in the first round had gone against 
appellant No. 1 herein, the rejection of the claim of the 
appellants for additional TDR on the basis of “prevailing 
policy” would have become final and unquestionable. 
18. In other words, during the period from 1996 to 
2009, the right to claim additional TDR was in 
suspended animation. Therefore, the appellants had to 
necessarily wait till the cloud over their right got 
cleared. To say that the wait of the appellants during 
the period of this cloudy weather, tantamount to 
abandonment, is clearly unjustified and unacceptable. 
Therefore, the finding recorded by the High Court on 
question No. 1 is not in tune with the law or the facts of 
the present case and hence question No.1 has to be 
answered in favour of the appellants herein.” 
(underlining by us) 
14.1 The next question considered was whether the finding of 
fact arrived at by the High Court that the appellant therein did 
not and could not have developed the amenity, calls for any 
interference, especially in light of the statutory provisions and 
the facts of the case. The statutory provisions in Section 
126(1)(b) were adverted to on the approach that the authorities 
ought to have in these matters and this Court observed as 
under: 

“21. As we have noted earlier, clauses (a), (b) and (c) 
were inserted by way of substitution in sub-section (1) 
of Section 126 under Maharashtra Act 10 of 1994 with 
effect from 25.03.1991. 
22. As per Section 126(1), whenever the Planning 
Authority or Development Authority finds after the 
publication of a draft Regional Plan or a Development 
Plan that any land is required or reserved for any of the 
public purposes mentioned in the plan, such authority 
may acquire the land for the said public purpose. This 
acquisition can be made by three different methods, 
indicated in clauses (a), (b) and (c). The methods of 
acquisition prescribed in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of sub-
section (1) of Section 126, in simple terms are as 
follows:— 
(i) The acquisition may be through an agreement 
entered into with the owner, by paying an amount 
agreed to; 
(ii) Alternatively, the acquisition may be by the grant 
of FSI or TDR in lieu of any payment, along with 
Additional FSI or Additional TDR against the 
development or construction of the amenity on the 
surrendered land at the cost of the owner; or 
(iii) The acquisition may also be by requesting the State 
Government to initiate the process of land 
acquisition under the Right to Fair Compensation 
and 
Transparency 
in 
Land 
Acquisition, 
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. 
23. We are concerned in this case with the second 
method of acquisition of land indicated in clause (b) of 
sub-section (1) of Section 126. Under this clause, the 
owner and the planning authority are granted the 
leverage to agree that the compensation for the 
acquisition of the land will be for a consideration, not 
paid in the form of cash but granted in kind, in the 

form of two things, namely, (i) FSI or TDR for the area 
of 
land 
surrendered; 
and (ii) additional 
FSI 
or 
additional 
TDR 
against 
the 
development 
or 
construction of the amenity on the surrendered land. 
24. Once the parties are ad idem on the fact that the 
case is covered by clause (b), then what is necessary to 
be seen by Courts is: (i) whether the parties had 
agreed to give/take FSI or TDR in lieu of the amount of 
compensation?; and (ii) whether there was a valid claim 
for the grant of additional FSI or additional TDR 
towards the development or construction of the 
amenity on the surrendered land at the cost of the 
owner?.” 
 
14.2 This Court observed therein that there was no dispute on 
facts that the appellants therein had surrendered the land and 
accepted TDR in lieu of compensation. The only question was 
whether parties had satisfied the last limb of clause (b) which 
reads as under: 
 “26. ……and also further additional Floor Space Index 
or Transferable Development Rights against the 
development or construction of the amenity on the 
surrendered land at his cost, as the Final Development 
Control Regulations prepared in this behalf provide,” 
 
14.3 It was observed that the owner of the land is under an 
obligation to develop or construct the amenity on the 
surrendered land at his cost and the Planning Authority has to 

reciprocate the same by granting additional FSI or additional 
TDR. While considering the said issue, both on facts as well as 
in law, this Court referred to the definition of the word 
“amenity” and “development” in Section 2(2) and 2(7) 
respectively of the Act and observed that the word “amenity” 
means several things including recreational grounds in respect 
of which the controversy arose in the said case. There was a 
dispute as to whether the appellant therein had not developed 
the recreational grounds. While considering the expression 
“development”, it was observed that the same was of wide 
import and in fact clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 126 of 
the Act has used both the expressions, namely (i) development; 
and (ii) construction. Therefore, the word “development” has to 
be understood to mean any activity which may or may not 
include construction. Therefore, the question in the said case 
was, whether, the appellant therein had developed or 
constructed any amenity which ought to be tested with 
reference to the final DCR. While referring to the definition of 
amenity in Regulation 2(7) which includes recreational grounds, 

reference was made to Regulation 34 and it was observed that 
Appendix-VII was later renumbered as Appendix-VII-A vide 
order dated 15.10.1997. It was observed that clauses (5), (6) 
and (7) of the Regulation 34 was the substratum of the 
controversy before the High Court. 
14.4 Going through the entire gamut of correspondence 
involved in the said case, it was held that all the activities 
undertaken by appellant No.1 therein through the Architects till 
handing over of the possession of the land were not towards the 
development of amenity and the grant of additional TDR. All 
these works were undertaken as part of the effort to make the 
Municipal Corporation accept the surrender of land and to 
grant TDR. On the facts of the said case, it was held that no 
amenity was developed as required by law by appellants Nos.1 
and 2 therein to be entitled to additional TDR. Therefore, on 
facts, it was held that appellant was not entitled for additional 
TDR. Accordingly, the view of the High Court was confirmed 
and the appeal was dismissed. 

Yeshwant Jagannath Vaity: 
15. In Yeshwant Jagannath Vaity, the facts were that the 
respondents therein owned 10,000 sq. yards of land in Mulund 
village, which came within the area of Greater Bombay. A 
development plan was sanctioned for Greater Bombay in the 
year 1957. The said land was shown as reserved for public 
purpose of construction of a godown. However, the respondents 
and four other co-owners entered into a private agreement to 
handover possession of 10,000 sq. yards to the Municipal 
Corporation of Greater Bombay (MCGB) for temporary use as a 
truck terminal. The land was also to be used as a town duty 
office. The possession was handed over on 18.09.1961. The 
land was not put to any other use till November 1998. 
Therefore, was filed seeking a 
declaration that the land was not liable to be acquired which 
resulted into a compromise between the parties in which MCGB 
agreed to acquire and retain the area of 3500 sq. metres for the 
purpose of establishing and constructing an export octroi office. 
The respondents therein constructed the export office and also 

developed the surrounding area. The possession of the export 
office and the courtyard was handed over to the MCGB for 
which a possession receipt was also issued. An application was 
made by the respondents for TDR in respect of the export office 
being 3500 sq. metres equivalent of the 100 per cent of the 
built-up area of the export office. However, insofar as the 
additional transferable rights in lieu of the development of the 
export courtyard surrounding the export office was concerned, 
the same was restricted to 466.96 sq. metres being 15 per cent 
of the built-up area of the courtyard. 
15.1 The respondents not having received a favourable 
response to their request filed a writ petition which was allowed 
by the High Court. The High Court while granting the relief 
relied upon the judgment of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I. In 
the appeal filed by the MCGB, several contentions were raised 
including 
the 
contention 
regarding 
the 
Circular 
dated 
09.04.1996 having no bearing on Godrej & Boyce I, since it 
was issued after the landowners had surrendered their plot of 
land after construction of the roads as required by the 

Municipal Council while in the said case the said Circular was 
issued prior to the respondents No.1 and 3 therein completing 
the construction of an export office and asphalting of the 
courtyard and handing over the possession. Several arguments 
were advanced to distinguish the judgment of this Court in 
Godrej & Boyce I. This Court observed that the works done by 
the respondent therein was an amenity and the Circular dated 
09.04.1996 did not have any bearing on the case as it was 
issued after the compromise in the Writ Petition on 10.03.1992 
and the issuance of the letter of intent dated 22.02.1995. 
Accordingly, the appeal filed by the respondent MCGB was 
dismissed. 
15.2 The reasoning of this Court in the said judgment is 
squarely applicable to these cases. This Court held that the 
High Court was right in allowing the writ petition filed by the 
respondent therein and granting 100% TDR as against the 
development of the courtyard by asphalting the same. 

Delay and Laches: 
16. However, most of the writ petitions which were filed by the 
appellants herein were dismissed on the ground of delay and 
laches by the Bombay High Court. We have already adverted to 
the judgment of this Court in Godrej & Boyce II on the aspect 
of abandonment of the claim. The contentions of learned senior 
counsel and learned counsel for the appellants would not call 
for a reiteration. 
17. At this stage, we shall consider some of the judgments 
relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the respective 
parties. 
 
On the question of discretion of courts in considering the 
issue of delay and laches, this Court in Vidya Devi vs. State of 
Himachal Pradesh, (2020) (“Vidya Devi”) noted 
as under, 
“12.12. The contention advanced by the State of delay 
and laches of the appellant in moving the Court is also 
liable to be rejected. Delay and laches cannot be 
raised in a case of a continuing cause of action, or if 
the circumstances shock the judicial conscience of the 
Court. Condonation of delay is a matter of judicial 
discretion, which must be exercised judiciously and 

reasonably in the facts and circumstances of a case. 
It will depend upon the breach of fundamental rights, 
and the remedy claimed, and when and how the delay 
arose. There is no period of limitation prescribed for 
the 
courts 
to 
exercise 
their 
constitutional 
jurisdiction to do substantial justice.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
17.1 On the question of the principles the Court should rely 
upon when exercising the discretion to condone delay and 
laches, the following judgments are instructive. 

In Dehri Rohtas Light Rly. Co. Ltd. vs. District Board, 
Bhojpur, (1992), this Court noted that: 
“13... The principle on which the relief to the party on 
the grounds of laches or delay is denied is that the 
rights which have accrued to others by reason of the 
delay in filing the petition should not be allowed to be 
disturbed unless there is a reasonable explanation for 
the delay. The real test to determine delay in such 
cases is that the petitioner should come to the writ 
court before a parallel right is created and that the 
lapse of time is not attributable to any laches or 
negligence. The test is not as to physical running of 
time. Where the circumstances justifying the 
conduct exist, the illegality which is manifest 
cannot be sustained on the sole ground of laches.” 
 (emphasis supplied) 

In Tukaram Kana Joshi vs. Maharashtra Industrial 
Development Corporation, (2013), this Court 

held, albeit in the context of the State taking over possession of 
land without any sanction of law, to the following effect: 
“12… Our Constitution is an organic and flexible one. 
Delay and laches is adopted as a mode of discretion to 
decline exercise of jurisdiction to grant relief. There is 
another facet. The Court is required to exercise judicial 
discretion. The said discretion is dependent on facts 
and circumstances of the cases. Delay and laches is 
one of the facets to deny exercise of discretion. It is 
not 
an 
absolute 
impediment. 
There 
can 
be 
mitigating factors, continuity of cause action, etc. 
That apart, if the whole thing shocks the judicial 
conscience, then the Court should exercise the 
discretion more so, when no third-party interest is 
involved.” 
(emphasis supplied) 

In Kazi Moinuddin Kazi Bashiroddin vs. Maharashtra 
Tourism Development Corporation,, at para 26, this Court noted that, in matters relating to 
payment of amount of compensation to land losers, if at all two 
views are possible, the view that advances the cause of justice 
is always to be preferred rather than the other view, which may 
draw its strength only from technicalities. 
17.2 On the question of abandonment or waiver of rights, this 
Court in G.T. Lad vs. Chemical and Fibres of India Ltd., 

(1979) noted, albeit in the context of workmen 
abandoning service, that “to constitute abandonment, there 
must be total or complete giving up of duties so as to indicate 
an intention not to resume the same”. It further noted that 
such abandonment is always a question of intention. 
17.3 Further, in State of Punjab vs. Davinder Pal Singh 
Bhullar, (2011), this Court dealt with the 
doctrine of waiver. It held that, to constitute waiver, the person 
who is said to have waived, must have intentionally abandoned 
his rights with full knowledge after being fully informed of his 
rights. 
18. In the following Writ Petitions by the impugned order 
dated 18.12.2018 the Bombay High Court observed as follows 
and dismissed the Writ Petitions on the ground of delay and 
laches. 
“ (i) WP No.1898 of 2009 – 
Kukreja Construction and Others vs. The State 
of Maharashtra and Others. 
 
35. In, the petitioners' 
land was reserved for 18.3 meters wide DP Road. 
The petitioners surrendered the reserved land and 
were granted TDR in lieu of the reserved land. 

Thereafter, the petitioners constructed DP Road as 
claimed in the petition and a completion certificate 
was issued on 19th August 1994. According to the 
case of the petitioners, they carried out work of 
storm water drain for which competition certificate 
was issued 17th March 2003. According to their 
case, the TDR in respect of the land was issued on 
16th March 1994 and 5th April 2003. On 21st July 
2003, the petitioners through their Architect applied 
for grant of additional TDR under clause (6) of 
Appendix-VII. But the application made by the 
petitioner (Exhibit-I) shows that on 21st July 2003, 
only 25% additional TDR was claimed in respect of 
amenity of DP Road. It is not the case of the 
petitioners that thereafter they followed the said 
application by issuing reminders. For six years or 
more, no claim was made for 100% TDR on account 
of construction of the amenity. However, on 28th 
August 
2009, 
through 
their 
Architect, 
the 
petitioners applied for grant of additional TDR for 
the amenity equivalent to 100% of the area. The said 
application was made only after the decision of the 
Apex Court in the case of Godrej & Boyce 
Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (supra) and the present 
petition was lodged on 15th September 2009. 
Therefore, in facts of the case, no relief can be 
granted as for a period of more than six years after 
surrender, no claim was made for 100% TDR. 
 
(ii) WP No.1823 of 2009 – 
Jitendra 
Amritlal 
Sheth 
vs. 
State 
of 
Maharashtra and Others. 
 
37. 
Now, 
we 
come 
to 
Writ 
Petition 
No.1823/2012. In this case, the possession of DP 
Road after its construction was handed over by the 
petitioners to the Municipal Corporation on 5th 
March 2005. On 24th February 2009, the petitioners' 

Architect for the first time applied for 100% FSI in 
lieu of the constructed amenity. There was inaction 
for more than 3 years and 11 months and claim for 
100% additional TDR was not made. The averments 
made in the petition show that on 18th November 
2009, a reminder was issued. By communication 
dated 7th December 2009, the proposal of the 
Architect was specifically rejected. The petition was 
affirmed on 30th July 2012 i.e. two years after the 
prayer for grant of 100% TDR was turned down. The 
explanation for delay given by way of amendment to 
the petition is that on 7th March 2010, a file 
containing correspondence and judgments of the 
Supreme Court was handed over to the attorneys. It 
is stated that amendment of 17th June 2010 to the 
DCR was made available to the petitioners in July 
2010. On 8th January 2011, the Legal Consultant of 
the 
fourth 
petitioner 
by 
writing 
an 
email 
enquired with the Solicitors whether draft was 
ready. On 25th January 2011, it is claimed that the 
draft was forwarded. Thereafter, on 18th July 2011, 
a meeting was held between the petitioners, their 
Legal Consultant and Architect. It is claimed that 
the documents were furnished by the Architect to 
their advocate on 15th June 2012 and, ultimately, 
on 30th July 2012, the petition was filed. This is 
hardly an explanation for delay of 2½ years, 
especially when in the facts, of the case after 
construction of DP Road, the possession of the same 
was handed over on 5th March 2005. There is no 
explanation for not claiming 100% TDR within three 
years from that date. Even after entrusting the case 
to the Advocate, there is a long delay. Hence, 
considering the gross delay and laches which is not 
at all explained, this is a case where a Writ Court 
should not allow the party to invoke its extra 
ordinary 
jurisdiction 
under Article 
226 of 
the 
Constitution of India. 

WP No.839 of 2015 – 
Geeta alias Chandani Umesh Gandhi vs. The 
State of Maharashtra and others. 
 
38. 
In, the possession 
of DP Road was handed over to the Municipal 
Corporation on 20th May 2005. On 31st December 
2006, 25% FSI/TDR in respect of the constructed 
road was granted. On 1st December 2009, the 
petitioner through her Architect requested to release 
balance 75% TDR towards the amenity developed. 
The perusal of the averments made in the petition 
shows that after lapse of 4½ years thereafter, by a 
letter dated 20th June 2014, the petitioner requested 
the Municipal Corporation to issue balance 75% 
TDR. Thereafter, there was a legal notice sent on 1st 
December 2014. The petition was filed one year 
thereafter in January 2015. There is absolutely no 
explanation as to why there is a complete inaction 
on the part of the petitioner from 1st December 2009 
when the petitioner's Architect applied for grant of 
remaining 75% additional TDR till 20th June 2014 
when similar request was made by the petitioner. As 
there is no explanation for this inaction for a period 
of more 4½ years and the delay involved thereafter, 
this is not a fit case wherein a Writ Court should 
exercise 
jurisdiction 
under Article 
226 of 
the 
Constitution of India. 
 
(iv) WP No.2871 of 2015 – 
Jameel A. Hussain and Others vs. State of 
Maharashtra and Others. 
 
39. 
In 
Writ 
Petition 
No.2871/2015, 
the 
reservation of the land claimed by the petitioners 
was for DP Road. The possession of the developed 
portion of the reserved land was taken over by the 
said Corporation on 29th July 2004. The completion 
certificate was issued on 23rd August 2014. It is 

claimed in the petition that FSI in respect of 
surrender of land was granted but FSI in respect of 
amenity constructed thereon was never granted. 
Going by the averments made in the petition, 
though the petitioners claim to have surrendered 
the reserved land with amenity on 29th July 2004, 
the petitioners never applied for grant of 100% TDR 
in respect of the amenity. Even after the decision of 
the Apex Court in the case of Godrej & Boyce 
Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (supra) which is of 6th 
February 2009, the petitioners did not apply for 
grant of additional FSI/ TDR in respect of amenity 
surrendered in the year 2004 and for the first time 
by a letter dated 17th February 2012, the petitioners 
applied for grant of additional TDR. The proposal for 
grant of additional TDR was rejected on 30th 
January 2015. Thereafter the petition was filed. 
Thus, after surrendering the reserved land on 29th 
July 2004, the petitioners never claimed TDR in 
respect of the amenity developed by them till 17th 
February 2012. The application was made three 
years after the decision of the Apex Court in the 
case of Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Co. Ltd. 
(supra). Considering this conduct of the petitioners 
which virtually amounts to abandonment of their 
right, no relief can be granted to the petitioners in 
this petition. 
 
(v) WP No.2107 of 2016 – 
M/s Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Pvt. Ltd. and Another 
vs. 
The 
Municipal 
Corporation 
of 
Greater 
Mumbai and Others.– 
 
40. 
In, according to 
the case of the petitioners, they constructed DP 
Road. They surrendered the reserved land on 5th 
June 2007. Their Architects/ Licensed Surveyors 
made an application on 4th September 2009 for 

grant of 100% additional TDR in the light of the 
decision of the Apex Court. A legal notice was issued 
by their advocate on 7th December 2009. Thereafter, 
the petitioners took no steps and after a gap of 6½ 
years on 21st July 2016, the petitioners called upon 
the said Corporation to grant additional FSI/TDR. 
The correspondence made by the petitioners in the 
year 2009 was based on the decision of the Apex 
Court 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Godrej 
& 
Boyce 
Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (supra). The petitioners 
sought to rely upon the subsequent decision of the 
Apex Court dated 5th May 2016 in the case 
of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai v. 
Natvar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd. (Civil Appeal 
No.1479/2015) which followed the decision of the 
Apex Court in the case of Godrej & Boyce 
Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (supra). There is no 
explanation offered in the petition as to why there 
was complete inaction on the part of the petitioners 
from 2009 to 2016. Therefore, considering this 
conduct of the petitioners, they are dis-entitled to 
any relief. 
 
(vi) WP No.2170 of 2016 – 
Girdharlal D. Rughani Alia Thakkar H.U.F. and 
Another vs. The State of Maharashtra and 
Others.– 
 
41. In, the case of the 
petitioners is that on 20th October 1995 they handed 
over the possession of their land reserved for DP 
Road to the said Corporation. They claimed that 
after completing the construction of DP Road on 20th 
October 1994, a completion certificate was granted 
by the Municipal Corporation. It is not the case of 
the petitioners that thereafter they applied for grant 
of additional 100% TDR in respect of the amenity 
developed. Only on 5th August 2014 (i.e. ten years 

after developing the amenity) that the petitioners 
applied for grant of additional TDR through their 
Architect. For a period of 10 years, the petitioners 
never claimed 100% additional TDR in respect of the 
amenity. Even thereafter, no action is taken and the 
present petition is filed in July 2016. Considering 
the conduct of the petitioners, they are not entitled 
to any relief. 
 
(vii) WP No.384 of 2017 – 
Oberoi Realty Limited and Another vs. Municipal 
Corporation of Greater Mumbai and Others.– 
 
42. In, the case of the 
petitioners is that between 2004 and 2008, they 
developed seven DP Roads and handed over the 
possession thereof to the said Corporation. However, 
they made representation for the first time on 10th 
June 2016 claiming additional TDR in respect of 
amenity developed. The representation was rejected 
on 30th November 2016 by the said Corporation. 
Thus, even after the decision in the case of Godrej 
& Boyce Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (supra), the 
petitioners did not apply for grant of additional TDR. 
The petitioners sought additional TDR after lapse of 
eight years and more. Therefore, for a period of eight 
years or more, the petitioners never claimed 
additional TDR. Hence, considering the delay and 
laches on the part of the petitioners, no relief can be 
granted. 
 
(viii) WP No.541 of 2017 - 
Nanabhoy Jeejeebhoy Pvt. Ltd. and Another vs. 
The State of Maharashtra and Others. – 
 
43. In, the case of the 
petitioners is that there were eleven reservations on 
their property for DP Roads. The petitioners have 

referred to the said reservations as DP Road-I to DP 
Road-XI. According to the case of the petitioners, 
after developing the amenities, the possession of 
DP Roads was handed over to the said Corporation 
on 13th April 2004, 20th March 2001, 27th March 
2002, 6th September 2001, 13th February 2006, 
27th October 1997, 27th October 1997, 29th October 
1997, 21st December 2002, 22nd May 2002 and 14th 
August 2002 respectively. For the first time 
additional TDR was claimed by the petitioners by 
making application on 11th July 2014. Thus, in all 
cases except one, the possession was handed over 
after the development of DP Roads before the year 
2003. In some cases, the possession of DP Road 
was handed over in the year 1997. In one case, the 
possession was handed over in the year 2006. 
Thus, after lapse of several years after handing 
over possession of DP Roads i.e. in 2014, belatedly 
a request was made for grant of additional TDR. 
The request was made after a gap of about 8 to 13 
years for which there is no explanation. Thus, the 
petitioners 
by 
their 
conduct 
have 
virtually 
abandoned their claim for additional FSI/TDR in 
respect of amenity.” 
 
In 
all 
these 
cases, 
we 
find 
that 
the 
writ 
petitioners/appellants herein had surrendered the reserved 
land and had also been granted 25% TDR and a representation 
for additional TDR was made after the judgment of this Court in 
Godrej & Boyce I and in some cases, the representation was 
made early but in other cases, the representations were made 

after some time. It is also noted in, in the case of Natwar Parikh, this Court had stated 
that the decision in Godrej & Boyce I could not be revisited 
inasmuch as the Mumbai Municipal Corporation could not seek 
to reargue the matter. Also, the facts in each case on the 
questions of delay was to be considered as observed by this 
Court. The issue of abandonment of claim has also been 
considered and negatived in the judgment of this Court in 
Godrej & Boyce II. 
We have referred to the decisions of this Court where the 
question of delay and laches would not arise in matters such as 
the present cases. When relief in the nature of compensation is 
sought, as in the instant case, once the compensation is 
determined in the form of FSI/TDR, the same is payable even in 
the absence of there being any representation or request being 
made. In fact, a duty is cast on the State to pay compensation 
to the land losers as otherwise there would be a breach of 
Article 300-A of the Constitution. As rightly contended by the 
learned senior counsel for the writ petitioners/appellants 

herein, the respondent-Mumbai Municipal Corporation has not 
established that owing to a short delay even if it has occurred 
in any of these cases owing to uncertainty in law, the 
Corporation has been prejudiced by the same or that the third-
party rights had been created which could not be disturbed 
owing to delay or laches. The calculation of period of delay in 
the table submitted by learned senior counsel for the Mumbai 
Municipal Corporation is not acceptable in view of our 
discussion above. The decisions referred to by us above would 
clearly indicate that neither the doctrine of delay and laches nor 
the principle of abandonment of claim or waiver would apply in 
these cases. Rather the delay has occurred on the part of the 
Mumbai 
Municipal 
Corporation 
in 
complying 
with 
the 
Regulations insofar as these appellants are concerned. 
18.1 In view of the aforesaid discussion, we hold that the 
Bombay High Court was not right in dismissing the writ 
petitions on the ground of delay and laches. Hence, those 
portions of the impugned order of the High Court are set aside. 

19. We also do not find any merit in the three appeals filed by 
the Mumbai Municipal Corporation. Having regard to the earlier 
judgments of this Court, we find that the reasoning of the High 
Court on merits in the three impugned decisions discussed 
above is just and proper which would not call for any 
interference by this Court. 
20. Consequently, 
the 
civil 
appeals 
filed by 
the 
writ 
petitioners/appellants herein are allowed as under: 

Those portions of the impugned order dated 
18.12.2018 by which the writ petitions were 
dismissed on the ground of delay and laches are 
set aside and the respondent Mumbai Municipal 
Corporation is directed to consider the case of 
those writ petitioners/appellants herein in light of 
the judgments of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I 
and 
release 
the 
balance 
FSI/TDR 
to 
the 
appellants. 

However, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
appellant-Kukreja 
Construction company and others, the Mumbai 

Municipal Corporation is directed to consider the 
nature of the amenities constructed and thereafter 
to consider their case for additional FSI/TDR. 
(iii) The said exercise shall be carried out as 
expeditiously as possible and within a period of 
three months from today. 
20.1 The Civil Appeals filed by the Mumbai Municipal 
Corporation are dismissed and the cases of the respondents in 
those civil appeals shall be considered in terms of the 
judgments of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I and the balance 
FSI/TDR shall be released to the respondents therein within a 
period of three months from today. 
Parties to bear their respective costs.
