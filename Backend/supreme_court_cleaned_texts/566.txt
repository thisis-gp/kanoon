2. 
This appeal questions the correctness of the final judgment and order dated 
24th April, 2023, passed in MACA No.1168 of 2016 by the High Court of Orissa 
at Cuttack. The impugned judgment was in turn rendered in an appeal arising out 
of judgment dated 22nd August, 2016, passed by the Third Motor Accident Claims 
Tribunal, Jagatsinghpur in MAC No.301/2010. 
3. 
The background facts leading to the present appeal are: – 
3.1 
The claimant-appellant is the wife of the deceased, namely, Bichitra 
Nayak agula. The other claimant-appellants are the mother and two 

2|SLP(C)NO.27565/2023 
 
sons of the deceased. The deceased was employed as a ‘Khalasi’ in an 
ambulance bearing registration No.OR-04-J-5604. On 4th June, 2010, while 
the ambulance was on its way from Chandikhol to Paradeep, it collided with 
the back of a truck bearing registration No.OR-13-4727. The driver of the 
vehicle, namely, Prakash Palei sustained grievous injuries and the husband 
of the claimant-appellant, died on the spot. 
3.2 
At the time of death, the deceased an employee of ESSAR Steel 
Orissa Limited, aged 44 years, was earning Rs.5,000/- per month. The 
Tribunal noted that after the accident, the owner of the ambulance, paid a 
sum of Rs.6,25,000/- towards compensation to the bereaved family. 
3.3 
The sum and substance of the issue before the Tribunal was, 
(a) maintainability of the action initated for award of monetary 
compensation; (b) rash and negligent conduct of the truck driver; (c) whether 
the cause of death of the deceased was an accident; (d) compensation 
payable, if any, to what extent, and by whom. 
3.4 
The Tribunal concluded that no rash and negligent act could be 
attributed to the driver of the truck which resulted in the death of the 
claimant-appellant’s husband. Consequent to the above, it was held that no 
liability could be fastened on either the owner or the insurer of the truck to 
compensate the claimant-appellants. 
3.5 
Thus, the Tribunal held the claim petition not to be maintainable.

4. 
On appeal, the High Court observed: 
“10….The deceased was aged about 36 years as on 01.01.2002 as 
per his Voter I-Card produced by Mr. Satapathy, learned counsel for 
respondent No.4 in course of hearing. This is not disputed by the 
claimants. As such, his age o the date of accident is taken between 44 to 
45 years, coming within the slab of 41-45 years. So the applicable 
multiplier is ‘14’. Adding future prospects to the extent of 25% and 
deducting 1/3rd towards personal expenses, the loss of dependency comes 
to Rs.7,00,000/-. Adding Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of consortium for 
the widow and two children and Rs.30,000/- towards loss of estate and 
funeral expenses, the total compensation is determined at Rs.8,30,000/-. 
11. As stated earlier, since receipt of compensation of 
Rs.6,25,000/- from the owner of the Ambulance has been established on 
record and accepted at the Bar, the same is adjusted from total 
compensation amount payable. It is also established that the same has 
been paid immediately after the accident and before filing of the claim 
application. Therefore, the balance amount of Rs.2,05,000/- is liable to 
be paid by both the insurers along with interest @ 6% per annum.” 
 
5. 
Undisputably, only the claimant-appellants have preferred the instant 
appeal with the owner and insurer of the offending vehicle having accepted the 
findings of fact. As can be seen from the extracted portion, the High Court 
deducted 1/3rd towards personal expenses. However, a perusal of the affidavit 
filed by the wife of the deceased (claimant-appellant No.1) before the High Court 
shows four dependents on the deceased hence the deduction has to be by 1/4th 
and not 1/3rd as directed by the High Court. 
6. 
In regard to future prospects, the High Court has taken 25% in addition to 
the actual salary. It is submitted that 30% addition is to be applied. In this regard 
we may notice para 59.3 of the Constitution Bench decision in National 
Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi1, which holds that if the deceased is holding 
 
1 (2017) 

4|SLP(C)NO.27565/2023 
 
a permanent job, 30% addition to the actual salary is to be made when the age of 
the deceased is between 40 to 50 years. The submission of the learned counsel 
for the claimant-appellants is to be accepted. 
7. 
In respect of loss of consortium towards four persons, the High Court has 
awarded Rs.1,00,000/-. We find this computation not to be in consonance with 
Pranay Sethi (supra). Para 52 of the said judgment reads as under: 
“52. As far as the conventional heads are concerned, we find it difficult 
to agree with the view expressed in Rajesh [Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh, 
(2013): (2013) 4 SCC (Civ) 179: (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 817: 
(2014) 1 SCC (L&S) 149]. It has granted Rs 25,000 towards funeral 
expenses, Rs 1,00,000 towards loss of consortium and Rs 1,00,000 
towards loss of care and guidance for minor children. The head relating 
to 
loss 
of 
care 
and 
minor 
children 
does 
not 
exist. 
Though Rajesh [Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh, (2013): (2013) 4 
SCC (Civ) 179: (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 817: (2014) 1 SCC (L&S) 149] 
refers to Santosh Devi [Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., 
(2012): (2012) 3 SCC (Civ) 726: (2012) 3 SCC (Cri) 160: (2012) 2 SCC (L&S) 167], it does not seem to follow the same. The 
conventional and traditional heads, needless to say, cannot be 
determined on percentage basis because that would not be an acceptable 
criterion. Unlike determination of income, the said heads have to be 
quantified. Any quantification must have a reasonable foundation. 
There can be no dispute over the fact that price index, fall in bank 
interest, escalation of rates in many a field have to be noticed. The court 
cannot remain oblivious to the same. There has been a thumb rule in 
this aspect. Otherwise, there will be extreme difficulty in determination 
of the same and unless the thumb rule is applied, there will be immense 
variation lacking any kind of consistency as a consequence of which, 
the orders passed by the tribunals and courts are likely to be unguided. 
Therefore, we think it seemly to fix reasonable sums. It seems to us that 
reasonable figures on conventional heads, namely, loss of estate, loss 
of consortium and funeral expenses should be Rs 15,000, Rs 40,000 and 
Rs 15,000 respectively. The principle of revisiting the said heads is an 
acceptable principle. But the revisit should not be fact-centric or 
quantum-centric. We think that it would be condign that the amount that 
we have quantified should be enhanced on percentage basis in every 
three years and the enhancement should be at the rate of 10% in a span 
of three years. We are disposed to hold so because that will bring in 
consistency in respect of those heads. 

5|SLP(C)NO.27565/2023 
 
8. 
Under the heads of loss of estate, loss of consortium and funeral expenses, 
this Court awarded Rs.15,000/-, Rs.40,000/- and Rs.15,000/- respectively. It was 
further directed that the amount so quantified should be enhanced by 10% every 
three years. By that metric, with the amount standing at Rs.40,000/- in the year 
2017, today it would be Rs.48,400/- (The amount having been enhanced by 10% 
twice). Hence, 48,400 x 4 = Rs.1,93,600/-. 
9. 
In conclusion, the ehanced amount of compensation, as modified as a result 
of the above discussion is encapsulated in a tabular format hereinbelow:-
