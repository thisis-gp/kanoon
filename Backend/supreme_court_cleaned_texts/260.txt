JUDGMENT 
 
VIKRAM NATH, J. 
 
1. This Court, on 7th April, 2021 passed the 
following order: 

SLP(CRL.) D. NO. 4235 OF 2021 

“FIR No. 22 of 2016 was lodged by respondent no. 
3 on 29.9.2016 under Sections 409, 420, 477(A) 
and Section 37 of the Foreign Contribution 
(Regulation) Act 2010. Investigation was taken up 
by the Economic Offences Wing (CID), Telangana 
State. The challenge to the FIR was rejected in 
SLP(Crl.) No. 3888 of 2017 on 12th September, 
2017 directing “the investigation to be concluded 
as expeditiously as possible and action, if required, 
in accordance with law be initiated thereafter.” 
Close on heels to the same on 17th August, 2018 
in another SLP(Crl.) D. No. 27899 of 2018 preferred 
by the informant respondent no. 3, declining 
interference, it was observed, “however, if the 
petitioner has any grievance with regard to the 
progress of the investigation of the case it will be 
open for him to move the appropriate forum 
including the High Court, if so advised.” 
In W.P. No. 13044 of 2019 preferred by 
respondent no. 3 before the High Court seeking 
directions for investigation by the Central Bureau 
of Investigation, a counter affidavit was filed by the 
Deputy Inspector General of Police, CBI, ACB, 
Hyderabad declining that the CBI had any role in 
the investigation for reasons mentioned therein. 
On 21st November, 2020 after more than four years 
of the registration of the First Information Report, 
the CID Telangana State froze the accounts of the 

SLP(CRL.) D. NO. 4235 OF 2021 

petitioners. This compelled the petitioners to 
approach the High Court which rejected the 
challenge to the freezing of the accounts, thus the 
present appeal. 
During the pendency of the present matter before 
this Court an I.A. No. 48029 of 2021 has been filed 
by the respondent-State of Telangana. It encloses a 
letter dated 24th March, 2021 addressed to the 
Ministry of Home Affairs. The relevant extract reads 
as follows: 
“It is to state that, the accused A-2, Joseph 
D’Souza filed a Special Leave Petition in the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of India vide SLP 
( against the 
Judgment and order passed by the Hon’ble High 
Court of Telangana, Hyderabad vide W.P. No. 
22547 of 2020, dated 27.01.2021 and contending 
that the State CID Unit is not authorized to 
conduct investigation in the case of FCRA when 
the amount involved is more than 1 Crore and 
that CBI is the competent authority under the 
notification issued by Ministry of Home Affairs 
vide SO No. 2446 (E), dated 27-10-2011. 
In view of the above facts and circumstances, it 
may be pleased to pass orders in the matter either 
permit to the CID TS to continue further 
investigation and file charge sheet or pass orders 

SLP(CRL.) D. NO. 4235 OF 2021 

by entrusting further investigation to CBI, ACB as 
deemed fit.” 
Pertinently this letter has been written after we 
issued notice on 22nd February, 2021. Explaining 
the letter paragraph 10 of the I.A. No. 48029 of 
2021 states as under: 
“10. ……..Respondents are not authorized to 
conduct investigation in the case of FCRA and 
that the CBI is the competent authority to 
conduct investigation as the amount involved is 
more than one crore. It was further stated that 
keeping 
into 
consideration 
the 
subsequent 
revelations 
through 
investigation, 
the 
respondents pleaded that orders may be passed 
to permit them to file charge sheet or to pass 
orders entrusting the investigation to CBI.” 
At this stage, we are, therefore, satisfied on the 
own showing of the respondent-State of Telangana 
that the order of attachment dated 21st November, 
2020 needs to be stayed in so far as salary and 
institutional expenses are concerned. It is ordered 
accordingly. 
The petitioners are directed to maintain proper 
and complete statement of accounts with regard to 
the institutional and salary expenses incurred from 
the concerned accounts frozen by order dated 21st 
November, 2020, in the meantime. 

SLP(CRL.) D. NO. 4235 OF 2021 

List the matter in the last week of July, 2021. In 
the 
meantime, 
parties 
may 
complete 
their 
pleadings.” 
2. Mr. Shyam Divan, learned Senior Counsel 
appearing for the petitioners submitted that the 
petitioners would be content and satisfied if the 
liberty granted by the aforesaid order to the 
petitioners to continue utilising their accounts 
for payment of salary and institutional expenses 
and would continue to maintain proper and 
complete statement of accounts for the same are 
continued, the petitioners would contest the 
pending proceedings before the High Courts and 
other Courts on their own merits and would avail 
such remedies as may be available under law 
with regard to the proceedings initiated against 
them. He thus submitted that the petition could 
be disposed of by making the order dated 7th 
April, 2021 absolute. 
3. On the other hand, learned counsel for the 
complainant as also the State of Telangana 
admitted the fact that the petitioner-organisation 
was actually running 103 institutions all over the 
country in 18 States and also more than a dozen 

SLP(CRL.) D. NO. 4235 OF 2021 

primary health centres for which they would 
require funds and that they were not interested 
in any way in shutting down the said 
institutions, 
both 
educational 
and 
health 
centres, but would insist that the statement of 
accounts must be properly maintained duly 
audited by chartered accountants and the same 
should be made available to the investigating 
agency as and when required on a regular 
periodical basis as may be directed by this 
Court. 
4. Learned counsel for the private respondents tried 
to press the Contempt Petition but considering 
the aforesaid submissions, we are not inclined to 
go into that question and leave it open for the 
investigating 
agency 
or 
the 
Trial 
Court 
monitoring the liberty granted by this Court to 
the petitioners for utilising their accounts to the 
limited 
extent 
of 
salary 
and 
institutional 
expenses are concerned. 
5. We may note here that Mr. Divan had taken the 
Court through various documents to show that 
actually there was no contempt and whatever 
amount had been withdrawn was within the 

SLP(CRL.) D. NO. 4235 OF 2021 

permissible limits depending upon the expenses 
incurred 
in 
the 
previous 
years 
and 
the 
allegations of any withdrawal from the accounts 
for purposes other than the salary and 
institutional expenses, is not correct. 
6. As already noted above, we are not going into that 
question. Accordingly, we are not recording any 
finding on the above aspect. 
7. In view of the above, we dispose of the petitions 
making the interim order dated 7th April, 2021 
absolute, however, with a rider that the 
petitioners would not only maintain proper and 
complete statement of accounts but would also 
get the same audited by a Chartered Accountant 
and provide quarterly statements of the same to 
the Investigating Officer or to the Trial Court on 
regular basis. The pending proceedings before all 
other forums to continue in accordance with law 
where it would be open for all the parties 
concerned to raise all such contentions as may 
be available under law. We also make it clear 
that we have not made any observations on 
merits and the above order has been passed only 
for smooth functioning of the 103 educational 

SLP(CRL.) D. NO. 4235 OF 2021 

institutions and more than a dozen primary 
health centres run by the petitioners. 
8. All the pending applications including contempt 
petition stand disposed of.
