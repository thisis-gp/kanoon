4. 
Vide the Impugned Orders, the High Court refused to 
quash the Docket Order dated 20.07.2021 which reinitiated 
criminal proceedings against the Appellants for offences u/s. 420, 
498A, 506 of the IPC & u/s. 3, 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 
1961.  
Brief Facts 
5. 
The Appellants before us are the husband and the in-laws 
of Respondent No. 2 i.e., the de-facto complainant. After the case 
against the Appellants for the aforementioned offences was 
instituted, the parties were referred to the Lok Adalat by the Trial 
Court. 
6. 
As per the Docket Order dated 26.06.2021, the parties 
entered into a compromise before the Lok Adalat and in 
consideration of the same, a petition for compounding of the 
offences was allowed by the Trial Court. Accordingly, the 
Appellants were acquitted by the Trial Court.   
7. 
Thereafter, Respondent No. 2 altered her position and filed 
a memo before the Trial Court withdrawing her consent from the 
compromise. Consequently, vide Docket Order dated 20.07.2021, 
the Trial Court reopened the proceedings against the Appellants.  
8. 
Aggrieved 
by 
this 
development, 
the 
Appellants 
approached the High Court u/s. 482 CrPC seeking to quash the 
Docket Order dated 20.07.2021 on inter alia grounds that 

SLP (Crl.) No. 9013 of 2023 
 
Page 3 of 7 
 
Respondent No. 2 sought to reopen the criminal proceedings only 
to wreak vengeance upon the Appellants. 
9. 
In case of the Appellant-husband, vide Impugned Order II, 
the High Court upheld the Docket Order dated 20.07.2021 and 
the set aside the compromise between the parties in view of the 
amendment1 to Sec. 320(2) CrPC, applicable to the State of 
Andhra Pradesh. As per the amendment, compounding of an 
offence u/s. 498A is only permissible after a lapse of three 
months from the date of request for compounding.  
10. 
In case of the in-laws, vide Impugned Order I, the High 
Court refused to grant the relief sought, noting the existence of 
prima facie allegations against the Appellants. However, in 
recognition of the fact that the allegations were general and 
omnibus in nature, the High Court dispensed with the presence 
of the Appellants during the trial and furthermore, left it open for 
the Trial Court to conduct trial. 
Submissions & Analysis:  
11. 
Learned Counsel for the Appellants vehemently submits 
that a bare perusal of the complaint filed by Respondent No.2 and 
the charge-sheet plainly discloses the absence of any necessary 
ingredients of the charged offences. It is submitted that the 
allegations are wholly general and omnibus in nature, made only 
 
1 Andhra Pradesh Act 11 of 2003, sec. 2 (w.e.f. 01.08.2003) 

SLP (Crl.) No. 9013 of 2023 
 
Page 4 of 7 
 
with the intention to harass the Appellants, amounting to an abuse 
of the process of the law.  
12. 
To buttress his contention, Learned Counsel for the 
Appellants has drawn the attention of this Court to the fact that 
Respondent No. 2 filed a petition seeking divorce and only 
thereafter, the memo seeking reopening of the criminal 
proceedings against the Appellants was filed before the Trial 
Court.  
13. 
This Court has heard the Learned Counsel for the parties 
and perused the record.  
14. 
In the considered opinion of this Court, there is significant 
merit in the submissions of the Learned Counsel for the 
Appellants. A bare perusal of the complaint, statement of 
witnesses’ and the charge-sheet shows that the allegations against 
the Appellants are wholly general and omnibus in nature; even if 
they are taken in their entirety, they do not prima facie make out 
a case against the Appellants. The material on record neither 
discloses any particulars of the offences alleged nor discloses the 
specific role/allegations assigned to any of the Appellants in the 
commission of the offences.  
15. 
The phenomenon of false implication by way of general 
omnibus allegations in the course of matrimonial disputes is not 
unknown to this Court. In Kahkashan Kausar alias Sonam v. 

SLP (Crl.) No. 9013 of 2023 
 
Page 5 of 7 
 
State of Bihar2, this Court dealt with a similar case wherein the 
allegations made by the complainant-wife against her in-laws u/s. 
498A and others were vague and general, lacking any specific 
role and particulars. The court proceeded to quash the FIR against 
the accused persons and noted that such a situation, if left 
unchecked, would result in the abuse of the process of law.  
16. 
More recently, this Court in Mahmood Ali v. State of U.P.3, 
while considering the principles applicable to the exercise of 
jurisdiction u/s. 482 CrPC, observed as follows: 
“12. At this stage, we would like to observe 
something important. Whenever an accused comes 
before the Court invoking either the inherent powers 
under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure (CrPC) or extraordinary jurisdiction 
under Article 226 of the Constitution to get the FIR 
or the criminal proceedings quashed essentially on 
the ground that such proceedings are manifestly 
frivolous or vexatious or instituted with the ulterior 
motive for wreaking vengeance, then in such 
circumstances the Court owes a duty to look into the 
FIR with care and a little more closely. We say so 
because once the complainant decides to proceed 
against the accused with an ulterior motive for 
wreaking personal vengeance, etc., then he would 
ensure that the FIR/complaint is very well drafted 
with all the necessary pleadings. The complainant 
would ensure that the averments made in the 
FIR/complaint are such that they disclose the 
necessary ingredients to constitute the alleged 
 
2 [(2022) 6 SCC 599] 
3 (Criminal Appeal No. 2341 of 2023)

offence. Therefore, it will not be just enough for the 
Court to look into the averments made in the 
FIR/complaint alone for the purpose of ascertaining 
whether the necessary ingredients to constitute the 
alleged offence are disclosed or not. In frivolous or 
vexatious proceedings, the Court owes a duty to 
look into many other attending circumstances 
emerging from the record of the case over and above 
the averments and, if need be, with due care and 
circumspection try to read in between the lines. The 
Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Section 
482 of the CrPC or Article 226 of the Constitution 
need not restrict itself only to the stage of a case but 
is empowered to take into account the overall 
circumstances leading to the initiation/registration 
of the case as well as the materials collected in the 
course of investigation. Take for instance the case 
on hand. Multiple FIRs have been registered over a 
period of time. It is in the background of such 
circumstances the registration of multiple FIRs 
assumes importance, thereby attracting the issue of 
wreaking vengeance out of private or personal 
grudge as alleged.” 
 
17. 
Considering the dicta in Mahmood Ali (supra), we find that 
the High Court in this case has failed to exercise due care and has 
mechanically permitted the criminal proceedings to continue 
despite specifically finding that the allegations are general and 
omnibus in nature. The Appellants herein approached the High 
Court on inter alia grounds that the proceedings were re-initiated 
on vexatious grounds and even highlighted the commencement 
of divorce proceedings by Respondent No. 2. In these peculiar 

SLP (Crl.) No. 9013 of 2023 
 
Page 7 of 7 
 
circumstances, the High Court had a duty to consider the 
allegations with great care and circumspection so as to protect 
against the danger of unjust prosecution.  
18. 
As stated above, given the facts and circumstances of the 
case, we find that the material on record is wholly insufficient to 
proceed against the Appellants. Accordingly, the Impugned 
Orders and the Docket Order dated 20.07.2021 are set aside and 
the criminal proceedings against the Appellants are consequently 
quashed. 
19. 
Resultantly, the appeals stand allowed.  
20. 
Pending applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of.
