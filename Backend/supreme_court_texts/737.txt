SATISH CHANDRA SHARMA, J.  
 
1. 
Leave Granted.  
2. 
The present batch of appeals arise out of judgement dated 
16.02.2023, passed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna in 
Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 3411/2022 (‘CWJC’) along 
with other connected matters (the ‘Impugned Order’),  whereby 
the Writ Petitioners who were the unsuccessful candidates in the 
Recruitment Process conducted pursuant to the Advertisement 
dated 08.03.2019 for the post of Junior Engineer (Civil), had 
challenged the vires of Rule 9(1)(ii) of the Bihar Water Resources 
Department Subordinate Engineering (Civil) Cadre Recruitment 
(Amendment) Rules 2017, published vide notification dated 
07.11.2017, prescribing technical qualification eligibility for 
selection/appointment to the technical post in the State of Bihar.  
The appellants before this Court are the successful candidates in 
the said Recruitment Process.  
3. 
The present matter begins with the issuance of 
Advertisement No. 01/2019 dated 08.03.2019 by the Bihar 
Technical Service Commission (‘BTSC’) inviting applications 
for 6,379 vacancies to the post of Junior Engineer across various 
state departments (the ‘Advertisement’). The Advertisement 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 3 of 19 
 
specified that the educational qualification required for the post 
of Junior Engineer (Civil) as under:  
“Educational Eligibility.  
a) 
Junior Engineer (Civil) 
i. 
Diploma-in-Civil Engineering conferred by the 
concerned Technical Educational Council/University 
recognised by All India Council of Technical Education, 
New Delhi.  
ii. 
Diploma-in-Civil Engineering through non-
distance mode conferred by the concerned Deemed 
University established under the UGC Act provided the 
Deemed University is duly approved by the University 
Grants Commission for the said Course.”  
 
It is pertinent to note that this requirement is drawn from 
and is identical to Rule 9(1)(iii) of the Bihar Water Resources 
Department Subordinate Engineering (Civil) Cadre Recruitment 
Rules, 2015 (the ‘Rules’) as amended in 2017.  
4. 
The private Respondents in the present appeal were the 
Writ Petitioners before the High Court. They were all applicants 
who possessed a Diploma from Private Universities/Institutions 
established by statute and approved by the University Grants 
Commission. Their applications were found ineligible by the 
BTSC on the ground that their institutions were not approved by 
the All-India Council of Technical Education (‘AICTE’). 
Aggrieved, they approached the High Court seeking the quashing 
of Rule 9(1)(iii) of the Rules as being inconsistent with other 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 4 of 19 
 
statutory provisions and judgement of the Apex Court in 
Bharathidasan University & Anr. vs. AICTE & Ors. 2001 (8) 
SCC 676 wherein, on an interpretation of the provisions of the 
All-India Council of Technical Education Act 1987, it was held 
that Universities are excluded from the purview of technical 
institutions and are thus not required to obtain approvals from the 
AICTE before introducing technical courses/programs.  
5. 
The Writ Petitioners relied on public notice dated 
09.02.2022 issued by the AICTE, to the VCs of all Central/State 
and Private Universities about AICTE approval for 2022-23, 
stating as follows:  
“Dear Sir/Madam, 
lt is intimated that Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in 
case of Bharathidasan University & Another Vs AICTE 
& Others has interpreted the provisions of the AICTE 
Act and has held that university do not require prior 
approval of AICTE to commence a new department of 
course and programmes in technical education. 
Universities have obligation or duty to conform to the 
standards and norms laid down by the AICTE. For the 
purpose of ensuring coordinated and integrated 
development of technical education and maintenance of 
standards, AICTE may cause an inspection of the 
university, which has to be as per the provisions under 
relevant rules/regulations of the AICTE. Further, all 
affiliated institutions running technical education 
programmes requires prior approval of AICTE. 
However, it has been observed that some of the Central 
/ State / Private Universities are taking partial approval 
of AICTE for some selected Technical Courses / 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 5 of 19 
 
Programmes, which is creating confusion among the 
stakeholders. 
 
Therefore, AICTE decided that no partial approval of 
technical courses will be given to Universities in order 
to avoid confusion among stakeholders. 
 
Accordingly, all universities are hereby informed that 
either they take full approval of all technical courses, 
or they can continue without approval of AICTE.”  
 
6. 
It is relevant to note that the stand of the Writ Petitioners 
was reinforced by the AICTE before the High Court, as made 
explicit by their Counter Affidavit dated 12.05.2022, which read 
as under:  
 
“8. That so far the statements made in paragraph no. 
15 of the writ petition concern it is submitted that 
AICTE vide its public notification for approval process 
2021-22 
had 
categorically 
clarified 
that 
the 
central/state public private universities are not required 
to take approval of the AICTE for technical programs 
except ODL and online courses.  This position has also 
been confirmed in the public notice issued for approval 
process 2022-23…………..” 
 
7. 
At this stage, it is apposite to observe that prior to the filing 
of CWJC No. 3411/2022, the High Court was already hearing 
several analogous writs challenging different provisions of the 
Rules as applicable to the selection process under the 
Advertisement. Accordingly, vide order dated 02.05.2019 passed 
in CWJC No. 9887/2019, the BTSC was permitted to continue 
the selection process, with the results to be kept in a sealed cover, 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 6 of 19 
 
pending the outcome of the proceedings. This order was later 
modified vide order dated 06.12.2019 in CWJC No. 21651/2018 
whereby the High Court allowed the selection process to be 
completed but directed that all orders of appointments must state 
that appointments are subject to the outcome of the writ petitions 
and therefore, the selected candidates cannot claim any equity.  
8. 
Accordingly, on 02.04.2022, the BTSC published its 
selection list for the posts advertised under the Advertisement 
(‘Select List’) and the selected candidates were also allotted to 
specific departments. In compliance with the aforenoted interim 
orders, the Select List reproduced the directions given by the 
Court in order dated 06.12.2019 and explicitly stated that the 
Select List shall be affected in light of the final order in the 
pending proceedings.  
9. 
Thereafter, in a separate analogous writ proceeding being 
CWJC No. 7312/2021, vide order dated 19.04.2022, Rule 4(A) 
of the Rules which granted 40% institutional reservation to 
diploma holders from State-run Polytechnic Institutes was found 
to be arbitrary and unreasonable. Consequently, Select list 
prepared in terms of Rule 4(A) was set aside and the BTSC was 
directed to prepare a fresh select list granting 40% institutional 
reservation to diploma holders from any polytechnic institute, 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 7 of 19 
 
recognized by the AICTE and affiliated with the State Board of 
Technical Institutions, Bihar and located within the State.  
10. 
Following this, the BTSC proceeded to finalise the merit 
list under the Advertisement but were directed by the High Court 
vide order 01.12.2022 in CWJC No. 7761/2022 to withhold the 
declaration of results until leave is granted by the Court. A list 
was prepared on 19.12.2022, put under sealed cover and 
permission of the Court was sought by filing an interlocutory 
application in CWJC No. 7761/2022 (the ‘Final Select List’). 
The hearing of the application was adjourned after the Advocate 
General informed the Court that the State Government was 
contemplating a review of the entire process.  
11. 
On 25.01.2023, the Govt. of Bihar convened a high-level 
meeting of Secretaries from different works departments to 
consider the legal issues emerging from the numerous pending 
litigations against the Rules and the Advertisement and the 
consequent 4-year delay in appointments. A decision was taken 
inter alia to cancel the appointment process under the 
Advertisement and to initiate approval for the amended Rules.   
12. 
Once the decision dated 25.01.2023 was brought on record 
before the High Court, the State Govt. was permitted to 
implement its decisions dated 25.01.2023 and the Court 
concluded that nothing remained in the matter. Accordingly, 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 8 of 19 
 
CWJC No. 3411/2022 and all other analogous writs were 
disposed of in the following manner:  
 
“In the instant writ petitions, petitioners have prayed 
for the following relief/reliefs: 
i. For quashing of Rule 9(1)(ii) of Rules 
“Bihar 
Water 
Resources 
Department 
Subordinate Engineering (Civil) Cadre 
Recruitment (Amendment) Rules, 2017 
contained in Notification no. 3950 dated 
07.11.2017 
prescribing 
technical 
qualification 
eligibility 
for 
selection/appointment to the technical post 
in the State of Bihar, as being inconsistent 
with 
other 
statutory 
provisions, 
in 
contravention of the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court’s judgment and is violative of 
fundamental rights guaranteed under the 
Constitution of India.  
ii. For declaration of the aforesaid rules as 
being ultra vires to the Constitution of India 
so far amendment of Rule -9(1)(iii) is 
concerned.  
iii. For any other relief/reliefs to which the 
petitioner is found entitled to. 
2. Matter is relating to selection and appointment to the 
post of Junior Engineer.  In this regard, advertisement 
was issued on 08.03.2019. From time to time, matter 
was taken up for hearing and during the course of the 
hearing we have noticed certain errors in the relevant 
Rules governing the post of Junior Engineer.  
Ultimately, State Government has taken a decision to 
cancel the process of recruitment to the post of Junior 
Engineer with reference to advertisement issued on 
08.03.2019 and proposed to issue a fresh or amendment 
of Rules while rectifying certain errors which have crept 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 9 of 19 
 
in the existing Rules.  To that effect, supplementary 
counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of respondent 
No. 4 while enclosing decision dated 25.01.2023 vide 
Annexure – A to the supplementary counter affidavit.   
Perusal of the same, it is evident that certain errors 
which have crept in the Rules would be carried in 
amendment of relevant Rules etc.  The proposed action 
of the State respondents reads as under:  
‘4. After due deliberations on all aspects, it 
was resolved that: 
a. In view of the legal wrangle crept in 
presently, the Recruitment process emanating 
from the Advertisement No.01/2019 notified 
by the Bihar Technical Service Commission 
be cancelled.  
b. The Department which earlier send its 
requisition 
for 
appointment 
to 
the 
Commission shall withdraw their respective 
requisition from the Bihar Technical Service 
Commission and such Department would 
send their such requisition afresh only after 
framing of new Recruitment Rules.  
c. Action be also initiated for cancellation of 
the Junior Engineer Recruitments Rules 
which are presently in vogue in various 
departments and thereafter, the amended 
Junior Engineer Recruitments Rules be 
framed.  
d. Steps be taken as to the approval of the 
Council of Ministers be accorded to the 
amended junior Engineer Recruitment Rules 
for the appointment of the Junior Engineer.’   
3. In the light of these new developments, the present 
petitions do not survive for consideration.  Accordingly, 
State is permitted to carry out necessary amendment 
and proceed afresh to advertise for the post of Junior 
Engineer.  

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 10 of 19 
 
4. From the date of last advertisement till date, almost 
four years have elapsed, therefore, such of those 
candidates who are likely to be over-aged with reference 
to ensuing advertisement, for such of those candidates 
(who are applicants to the advertisement dated 
08.03.2019), State Government must make a provision 
in the proposed amendment insofar as giving age 
relaxation as a one time measure. The above exercise 
shall be completed within a period of four months 
from the date of receipt of this order.  
5. Pending I.A., if any, stands disposed of. 
6. At this stage, learned counsel for one of the contesting 
respondent submitted that liberty may be reserved to 
challenge the proposed amendment.   Such liberty is not 
necessary for the reasons that as and when Rules or 
amended rules were issued afresh, it would be a fresh 
cause of action to the respective parties.”   
 
13. 
Learned Senior Counsels for the Appellants, Mr. Rajeev 
Dhavan, Mr. Ranjit Kumar and Ms. Meenakshi Arora urged 
before this Court that at the outset, the Writ Petitioners, having 
knowingly participated in the selection process under the 
Advertisement were bound by the doctrine of acquiescence and 
therefore, could not have challenged the eligibility criteria post-
facto. Reliance is placed on Punjab National Bank vs. Anit 
Kumar Das (2021) 12 SCC 80 and The Chairman SBI & Anr. 
vs. M.J. James (2022) 2 SCC 301.  
14. 
The learned counsels for the Appellants also contended 
that the cancellation of the entire selection process after its 
completion and preparation of the Final Select List, is unjustified 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 11 of 19 
 
and amounts to changing the rules of the game after the 
declaration of results, which is impermissible.  Reliance is placed 
on K. Manjusree vs. State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr. (2008) 3 
SCC 512. It is argued that the Appellants, who emerged 
successful after the due process of selection which was carried 
out as per the Advertisement, have a vested right to be appointed 
and are instead being made to suffer though no fault of their own. 
15. 
They further contended that the decision taken by the State 
Government and approved by the High Court amounts to 
arbitrary action as it fails to specify the concern/anomaly with 
Rule 9(1)(iii) which necessitated the cancellation of the entire 
process.  
16. 
Learned Counsel for the Private Respondents i.e., the Writ 
Petitioners before the High Court also contended that the 
cancellation of the entire selection process, at such a tardy stage 
would seriously impact their interests.  They argue that as per the 
stand of the AICTE before the High Court, their applications 
were eligible and should thus be reconsidered along with the 
applications of the Appellants.   
17. 
Learned Senior Counsel for the State, Mr. Patwalia 
vehemently contends that the State was well within its domain to 
scrap the selection process considering the numerous legal issues 
that cropped up concerning the previously applicable Rules. It is 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 12 of 19 
 
brought to the notice of this Court that in furtherance of its 
decisions, as approved by the Impugned Order, the Govt. of Bihar 
has repealed the existing Rules and notified the Bihar 
Subordinate Engineering (Civil/Mechanical/Electrical) Cadre 
Rules, 2023 (the ‘New Rules’) vide Notification No. 1174 dated 
07.03.2023. In compliance with the directions of the High Court, 
appropriate provisions for the grant of one-time age relaxations 
have also been made under Rule 8(2) of the New Rules. Further, 
the BTSC has cancelled the Advertisement vide notice dated 
10.04.2023 and fresh requisitions have been sent by the Water 
Resources Department to the BTSC vide letter dated 21.03.2023 
for selection against 2252 vacant posts for Junior Engineers in 
that department.  
18. 
Mr. Patwalia further contends that the completion of the 
selection process under the Advertisement, resulting in the Select 
List and in the Final Select List was consistently carried out with 
the rider that the appointments would be subject to the outcome 
of the pending litigation. He argues that while the Select List was 
partially set aside by the High Court vide order dated 19.04.2022, 
the Final Select List was neither considered by the High Court 
nor published, and therefore, no right to appointment vests with 
the Appellants, making any claim to equity untenable.  

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 13 of 19 
 
19. 
At this stage, it is pertinent to note that while issuing 
notice, this Court vide order dated 24.04.2023 directed the 
maintenance of status quo which has persisted till date. As per the 
most recent status report by the State, nearly 9,187 posts of Junior 
Engineers remain vacant, drastically affecting the day-to-day 
functioning of the State. As retirements are ongoing, the working 
strength is continuously decreasing and is currently at 11.7%. In 
recognition of the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, 
Mr. Patwalia has fairly stated before this Court that the State will 
abide by any appropriate direction given by the Court.  
20. 
We have heard Learned Counsel for the parties and 
perused the record.   
21. 
As evidenced above, the present case has a chequered 
history. Before the Advertisement was released, an amendment 
was brought to the Rules in 2017, more particularly to Rule 9, 
which restricted the eligibility criteria only to those candidates 
who possessed a Diploma from an institute approved by the 
AICTE. This amendment was prima facie contrary to the 
decision of this Court in Bharathidasan University (supra) 
which is solidified by the stand of the AICTE before this Court 
and their public notice dated 19.02.2022. However, despite this 
infraction, the Advertisement contained the same restriction, 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 14 of 19 
 
arbitrarily disqualifying persons like the Writ Petitioners from the 
selection process.  
22. 
Thereafter, the first Select List that was prepared was 
partly set aside vide order dated 19.04.2022 in CWJC No. 
7312/2021 and the BTSC was directed to prepare a fresh Select 
List as under:  
“Accordingly, appointments made to extent in terms of 
Rule 4(A) of amending Rules, 2017 are set aside and the 
Bihar State Technical Selection Commission is directed 
to prepare afresh select/merit list granting 40% 
institutional reservation to all the diploma holders, who 
have obtained their diploma certificate from any 
polytechnic institutes recognized by AICTU and 
affiliated by State Board of Technical Institutions, Bihar, 
Patna within the State of Bihar.” 
 
23. 
Consequently, the Select List prepared on 02.04.2022 was 
impliedly set aside and a Final Select List was prepared by the 
BTSC in compliance with order dated 19.04.2022 but the same 
was not released as ordered by the Patna High Court vide order 
dated 01.12.2022 in another analogous writ proceeding being 
CWJC No. 7761/2022 as under:  
“…Process of selection and appointment, in terms of 
advertisement dated 8.9.2019, is nearing completion.  
Under these circumstances, as prayed for, we grant two 
weeks’ time to file reply.  
In the meanwhile, process of selection may carry on, 
but the result shall not be declared without leave of the 
Court.” 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 15 of 19 
 
 
24. 
It is pertinent to note that the order dated 19.04.2022 
passed in CWJC No. 7312 of 2021 does not appear to have been 
challenged further and has attained finality.  It is stated by the 
BTSC that the Final Select List was prepared and kept under 
sealed cover. While an application seeking release of the list was 
pending before the High Court, the Writ Petition was withdrawn.  
25. 
During the present proceedings, vide order dated 
10.09.2024, this Court sought information regarding the Final 
Select List from the State Government and the same was 
produced before this Court in sealed cover.  
26. 
Presently, despite the preparation of the Final Select List 
which signals the conclusion of the appointment process, the 
State Government seeks to scrap the entire process and undertake 
a fresh appointment process under the New Rules.  In the 
considered opinion of this Court, this amounts to effectively 
changing the rules of the game after the game was played which 
is impermissible and deprives the candidates of their legitimate 
right of consideration under the previous Rules.   
27. 
The High Court in the impugned order has abruptly and 
without assigning reasons and without adjudicating any issues 
involved in the writ petitions, disposed of the same, recording the 
statement made by the learned counsel for the State, and 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 16 of 19 
 
permitted the State to amend Rules in question. Since, the entire 
recruitment process was concluded as per the extant Rules till the 
selection list was declared on 02.04.2022, which has not been 
specifically set aside by the High Court, and since the AICTE has 
also continued its stand that its approval is not necessary for the 
private institutions, and since the order dated 19.04.2022 passed 
in CWJC No. 7312/2021 has attained finality, in our opinion, the 
interest of justice would be met if the State/Commission is 
directed to prepare a fresh select list of meritorious candidates in 
respect of the Advertisement dated 08.03.2019, keeping in view 
the above facts and keeping in view that no appointments to the 
post of Junior Engineer (Civil) have been made since last more 
than ten years. 
Hence, it is required to be directed that a fresh 
selection list for the vacancies advertised in the Advertisement 
dated 08.03.2019 be prepared of the meritorious candidates, 
considering the above observations and in compliance with the 
order dated 19.04.2022 passed by the High Court in CWJC No. 
7312/2021 as expedient as possible and preferably within three 
months of this order. 
28. 
In this regard, the field is held by the three-judge bench 
decision of this Court in K. Manjusree (supra) wherein the Court, 
relying on previous decisions, explicitly held that introducing 
new requirements into the selection process after the entire 
selection process was completed amounted to changing the rules 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 17 of 19 
 
of the game after the game was played. Relevant portions of the 
judgement are reproduced as under:  
“27. But what could not have been done was the second 
change, by introduction of the criterion of minimum 
marks for the interview. The minimum marks for 
interview had never been adopted by the Andhra 
Pradesh High Court earlier for selection of District & 
Sessions Judges, (Grade II). In regard to the present 
selection, the Administrative Committee merely adopted 
the previous procedure in vogue. The previous 
procedure as stated above was to apply minimum marks 
only for written examination and not for the oral 
examination. We have referred to the proper 
interpretation of the earlier Resolutions dated 24-7-
2001 and 21-2-2002 and held that what was adopted on 
30-11-2004 was only minimum marks for written 
examination and not for the interviews. Therefore, 
introduction of the requirement of minimum marks 
for interview, after the entire selection process 
(consisting of written examination and interview) was 
completed, would amount to changing the rules of the 
game after the game was played which is clearly 
impermissible. We are fortified in this view by several 
decisions of this Court. It is sufficient to refer to three of 
them 
— P.K. 
Ramachandra 
Iyer v. Union 
of 
India [(1984) 2 SCC 141 : 1984 SCC (L&S) 214] 
, Umesh Chandra Shukla v. Union of India [(1985) 3 
SCC 721 : 1985 SCC (L&S) 919] and Durgacharan 
Misra v. State of Orissa [(1987) 4 SCC 646 : 1988 SCC 
(L&S) 36 : (1987) 5 ATC 148]  
32. In Maharashtra 
SRTC v. Rajendra 
Bhimrao 
Mandve [(2001) 10 SCC 51 : 2002 SCC (L&S) 720] this 
Court observed that “the rules of the game, meaning 
thereby, that the criteria for selection cannot be altered 
by the authorities concerned in the middle or after the 
process of selection has commenced”. In this case the 
position is much more serious. Here, not only the rules 

SLP (Civil) No. 7257 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 18 of 19 
 
of the game were changed, but they were changed 
after the game had been played and the results of the 
game were being awaited. That is unacceptable and 
impermissible.” 
 
29. 
Therefore, in light of the aforenoted position, the State 
action of scrapping the entire selection process is not permissible.  
In view of the peculiar circumstances of this case, particularly the 
prolonged pendency leading to huge number of vacant posts that 
hinder the Government’s functioning, this Court finds it 
appropriate for the State/BTSC to proceed with the Fresh Select 
List submitted in compliance with the order dated 19.04.2022 in 
CWJC No. 7312/2021 which has attained finality, as also taking 
into consideration as far as possible, the interest of the candidates 
who were found successful.  Hence, the Fresh Select List must 
be appropriately revised in the following manner: 
(i) 
The Fresh Select List be prepared in view of order dated
