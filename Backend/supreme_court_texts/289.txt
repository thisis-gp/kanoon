1. 
This appeal is directed against the final order dated 23rd 
January, 2023 passed by the National Consumer Disputes 
Redressal 
Commission 
(hereinafter 
being 
referred 
to 
as 
‘Commission’) whereby, the learned Commission, while allowing 
the Consumer Case No. 612 of 2018 filed by the appellants, issued 
the following directions: - 
“In view of the aforesaid discussions, the complaint is partly 
allowed. The opposite parties are directed to issue a fresh 
statement of account, duly crediting delayed compensation of 
Rs. 2433120/- as on 13.11.2017, within one month of the 
judgment. On the balance amount (except stamp duty and 
registration charges), the opposite parties will charge interest 
@9% per annum, from 14.11.2017 till the date of payment. The 
complainants be given one month time to deposit the amount. 
On settlement of the account, the opposite parties will execute 
conveyance deed in favour of the complainants and handover 

2 
 
possession of the unit, complete in all respect to them without 
any further delay.” 
 
2. 
The appellants herein are aggrieved by the direction passed 
by the learned Commission giving liberty to the respondent-
developer to charge interest @9% per annum on the balance 
amount (except stamp duty and registration charges) from 14th 
November, 2017 till the date of payment from the appellants-
homebuyers. 
3. 
We have heard and considered the arguments advanced by 
learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the 
impugned order and the material placed on record. 
4. 
It is admitted that the appellants being the homebuyers, had 
made payment of 90% of the total sale consideration of the flat in 
question to the respondent-developer till 23rd June, 2014. The said 
amount runs to nearly Rs.2,21,56,942.42/- (total consideration 
for 4111 sq. ft super area and amenities being Rs.2,38,20,932/-).  
5. 
Admittedly, the respondent-developer failed to handover the 
possession of the flat to the appellants-homebuyers by the 
scheduled date i.e. 16th March, 2014 upon which the consumer 
dispute came to be registered.  

3 
 
6. 
In this background, we are of the view that the learned 
Commission erred in directing that the opposite party i.e. 
respondent-developer shall be entitled to charge interest @9% per 
annum from the appellants-homebuyers on the balance amount 
(except stamp duty and registration charges) from 14th November, 
2017 till the date of payment. Thus, the said part of the impugned 
order whereby, the respondent-developer has been permitted to 
charge interest at the rate of 9% per annum on the balance amount 
is quashed and set aside.  
7. 
We direct the respondents to convey the outstanding amount 
to the appellants within a period of two months from today and 
upon payment being made, the possession of the flat in question 
shall be handed over to the appellants forthwith and not later than 
a period of 30 days from the date of final payment being made. 
8. 
The appeal is disposed of in the above terms. 
9. 
Pending application, if any, shall stand(s) disposed of.
