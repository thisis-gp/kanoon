Deenu (PW-1), Ahmad (PW-2) and Harun. Initially, accused nos.
1, 2 and 3 were tried in Sessions Case No. 12 of 1999 arising
from  FIR  No.  10  dated  09.01.1999  of  Police  Station  Nuh,
Haryana  in  which  they  were  convicted  for  offences  under
Sections 302 and 323 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal
Code, 18601 while acquitting them of the charge under Section
325 read with Section 34 of the IPC. During the pendency of the
trial  against  first  three  accused,  the  prosecution  moved  an
application  under  Section  319  of  the  Code  of  Criminal
Procedure,  19732 which  was  allowed  by  the  Trial  Court  on
02.11.1999. While the first trial was decided on 25.07.2001,
when accused Akhtar Hussain was absconding, he was tried
separately  after  he  surrendered,  and  charge  sheet  was
submitted on 01.04.2003. The trial against Akhtar Hussain in
Sessions Case No. 112 of 1999 dated 29.08.2003 was decided
on 05.10.2004 in which he was acquitted of the charges under
Sections 302, 323, 325 read with Section 34 of the IPC. 
2.
Akhtar  Hussain’s  (A4)  acquittal  was  challenged
before  the  High  Court  which  came  to  be  dismissed  against
which  no  further  appeal  has  been  preferred  either  by  the
complainant or by the State.

Under the impugned judgment in Criminal Appeal No.
1308 of 2012 the High Court has passed the common order
disposing of Criminal Appeal No. 437-DB of 2001 and Criminal
Revision No. 418 of 2005. The criminal appeal was preferred by
Mohd.  Yunus,  Mohd.  Jamil  and  Ghasita  challenging  their
conviction  by  the  Trial  Court  whereas  criminal  revision  was
preferred by the complainant-Deenu challenging the judgment
of acquittal passed in favour of accused-Akhtar Hussain. The
High  Court  dismissed  the  appeal  qua  accused-Ghasita  and
Mohd. Jamil whereas the appeal preferred by accused Mohd.
Yunus was allowed in part acquitting him of the charges under
Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC but maintained his
conviction for offence under Section 323 read with Section 34
IPC and sentenced him for the period already undergone. 
4.
Ghasita (A3) has died during the pendency of this
appeal.  Resultantly,  at  present,  out  of  the  four  accused
persons, Mohd. Yunus (A1) stands convicted only under Section
323 of the IPC, Ghasita (A3) has died, and Akhtar Hussain (A4)
is acquitted by the Trial Court and affirmed by the High Court
against  which  there  is  no  further  appeal.  Thus,  out  of  four

4
accused persons, only Mohd. Jamil (A2) stands convicted under
Sections 302 and 323 read with Section 34 IPC.
5.
Criminal Appeal No. 1307 of 2012 has been preferred
by  the  State  challenging  the  judgment  of  the  High  Court
acquitting Mohd. Yunus (A1) from the charges under Section
302 of the IPC while convicting him under Section 323 of the
IPC. 
6.
The prosecution case, in brief, is that at about 09.10
p.m on 09.01.1999, the informant-Deenu (PW1) along with his
brother Akbar (deceased) and Harun (son of PW1) were sitting
together  warming  themselves  in  front  of  fire.   When  the
deceased was going to his house, Ghasita (A3), his son Akhtar
Hussain (A4) armed with Pharsa, Mohd. Jamil (A2) armed with
Kulhari and Mohd. Yunus (A1) armed with lathi reached there to
teach a lesson in connection with a fight broke between them a
day before. As per the FIR, Ghasita (A3) and Akhtar Hussain
(A4) gave Pharsa blows on the head of the deceased. Akhtar
Hussain  (A4)  gave  another  blow  whereas  Jamil  (A2)  also
inflicted injuries by Kulhari on the head of the deceased. When
the deceased fell down Yunus (A1) gave lathi blows on the legs

5
of the deceased and Ghasita (A3) gave another Pharsa blow
over  his  head.   When  Ahmad  (PW2)  tried  to  rescue  the
deceased  from  the  accused  persons,  Yunus  (A1)  gave  lathi
blows on the shoulder of Ahmad (PW2). Deenu (PW1) lodged
the first information report.
7.
During  the  investigation,  Dr.  M.S.  Ranga  (PW3)
medically  examined  the  deceased-Akbar  and  found  the
following injuries on his person: 
 “(1).  Incised wound 2.5 cm x 2 cm x bone
deep placed over the scalp frontal region in the
midline transversely with profuse bleeding. 
(2)  Incised  wound  4cm  x  2mm  x  bone  deep
placed  over  the  frontal  region  of  the  scalp
profused  bleeding  placed  just  paralled  and
behind the injury no.1
(3) Incised wound 1cm x 2cm placed over the
frontal region of the scalp just lateral to injury
no.  1  &  2  placed  vertically  with  profused

(4) Incised wound 2cm x 1cm bone deep placed
over the frontal region of the scalp just behind
the injury no.3 anteroposteriorly."
PW-3 opined that the injuries are caused within six hours
by using sharp edged weapons.

Ahmad  (PW2)  received  two  injuries  over  his  right
shoulder  and  right  hip  joint  respectively.  Both  having  been
caused by blunt weapon within six hours. The deceased-Akbar
succumbed  to  the injuries  on  11.01.1999.  Dr.  Chander  Kant
(PW7) of Safdarjang Hospital, New Delhi conducted the post-
mortem examination and found the following injuries: 
“1.  One  transversely  placed  stitched  wound  on
right fronto temporal region. Total length 12 cm.
Total  number  of  stitches  12.  on  removal  of  the
stitches the wound was partially surgical in nature.

On  14.01.1999,  Yunus  (A1)  and  Jamil  (A2)  were
arrested  and  a  lathi  was  recovered  from  Mohd.  Yunus  (A1)
whereas Kulhari was recovered from Mohd. Jamil (A2) . Ghasita
(A3) was arrested on 22.01.1999 and blood stained Pharsa was
recovered from him. Akhtar Hussain (A4) was found innocent by
the  police  and  was  not  sent  for  trial.  However,  he  was
summoned later under Section 319 Cr.P.C. There is no recovery
against Akhtar Hussain (A4).  Akhtar Hussain (A4) challenged
the order of summoning before the High Court and the trial
against  him  was  stayed  which  commenced  later  on  after
dismissal of the criminal revision.
10.
During the course of trial, the prosecution examined
the  complainant/eye-witness-Deenu  (PW-1),  injured  eye-
witness-  Ahmad  (PW-2),  Dr.  M.S.  Ranga  (PW-3),  Constable
Sarwan  Kumar  (PW-4),  Head  Constable  Sunil  Dutt  (PW-5),
Constable Raj Kumar (PW-6), Dr. Chander Kant (PW-7), ASI Siri
Niwas (PW-8), Head Constable Hari Kishan (PW-9) and SI Daya
Nand (PW-10). However, listed prosecution witnesses namely,
Harun, Abdul Rashid, Mozam Khan, Rati Mohd. And Fattu were
gave up being unnecessary. 

8
In defence, accused appellants submitted certified copy of
complaint made by Ghasita (A3) against deceased-Akbar, PW
Harun and others for offences punishable under Sections 379,
380, 411, 406, 407, 452, 120-B, 506, 427 and 403 IPC for illegal
cutting and removal of 13 trees belonging to the Panchayat. A
copy  of  pedigree  showing  4th degree  relationship  between
prosecution witnesses namely, Deenu and Ahmad as well as
certified  copy  of  statement  of  Ghasita  (A3)  as  prosecution
witness in trial “State vs. Tundal etc.” under Section 304 IPC
were also submitted.
11.
Upon their conviction by the Trial Court, Mohd. Yunus
(A1), Mohd. Jamil (A2) and Ghasita (A3) preferred appeal before
the High Court which was dismissed qua Mohd. Jamil (A2) and
Ghasita (A3) whereas appeal preferred by Mohd. Jamil (A1) was
allowed in part. In the separate trial, Akhtar Hussain (A4) was
acquitted which was affirmed by the High Court against which
there is no further appeal.
12.
In the present Criminal Appeal No.1308 of 2012, we
are required to consider the legality and validity of conviction
imposed upon Jamil (A2) whereas in the Criminal Revision, the

9
State has called in question Yunus (A1) acquittal under Section
302 IPC. 
13.
It  was  argued  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the
appellant-Mohd.  Jamil  (A2)  that  the  FIR  is  ante-timed  and
delayed; the conviction is based on the testimony of interested
witnesses  who  are  closely  related  to  the  deceased  and  the
prosecution has failed to examine the independent witnesses
namely, Harun and Deenu s/o Kalu. It is also argued that the
presence  of  informant  (PW-1)   is  doubtful  considering  the
statement of Ahmad (PW-2) recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
in which he did not mention that Deenu (PW-1) was present at
the spot; moreover, Deenu’s clothes were not smeared with
blood, although Deenu deposed in his statement that after the
deceased suffered injuries he lifted him in an injured condition
and put him in the tractor.  Learned counsel has referred to the
omissions  and  contradictions  in  the  statements  of  these
witnesses.
14.
On the contrary, learned counsel appearing for the
State of Haryana would submit that conviction of Mohd. Jamil

10
(A2) under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC is born out
from  the  evidence  on  record,  which  is  unimpeachable,
therefore, no interference is called for. Challenging the acquittal
of Mohd. Yunus (A1) for offence under Section 302 read with
Section  34  IPC  (in  Criminal  Appeal  No.1307/2012),  learned
counsel for the State of Haryana argued that the same set of
evidence,  which  holds  good  for  convicting  Mohd.  Jamil  (A2)
should  have  been  given  due  weightage  for  upholding  the
conviction of Mohd. Yunus (A1) for the offence under Section
302 read with Section 34 IPC.  According to him, the High Court
ought not to have acquitted Mohd. Yunus (A1) of the charge
under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC.
15.
We  have  heard  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  at
length and perused the material available on record. 
16.
The High Court has rejected the argument qua delay
in registration of FIR or that it is ante-time, and we see no
reason to disagree with the High Court’s finding on this aspect
of the matter. 
17.
It is to be noticed that as per the first version of the
incident narrated by the informant-Deenu in the FIR lodged by

11
him,  Ghasita  (A3)  gave  a  Pharsa  blow  on  the  head  of  the
deceased and second blow was given by Akhtar Hussain (A4)
by Pharsa over his head and third blow was given by Mohd.
Jamil (A2) with Kulhari on his head and when the deceased fell
down, Mohd. Yunus (A1) gave a lathi blow and Ghasita (A3)
gave another blow over the head of the deceased. When Akhtar
Hussain (A4) was sent for trial, Deenu was examined as PW-7
who maintained his statement that Mohd. Jamil (A2), Ghasita
(A3)  and  Akhtar  Hussain  (A4)  assaulted  the  deceased  with
Pharsa  and  Kulhari.  Comparing  the  statement  of the Deenu
(PW-7) with the statement of Ahmad (PW-8), the Trial Court
found major contradictions and disbelieved the statement of
Deenu  (PW-7)  while  acquitting  Akhtar  Hussain(A4)  of  the
charges under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC. It was also
held in the said judgment of the Trial Court that PW-7 and PW-8
are  interested  witnesses  and  cannot  be  relied  upon  in  the
circumstances of the case.  Further it was noticed that PW-7 is
changing his stand inasmuch as in his earlier statement dated
08.07.1999 he denied that Ghasita (A3) and Akhtar Hussain
(A4)  were  armed  with  Pharsa  which  he  stated  in  the  trial
against Akhtar Hussain (A4). The Trial Court was of the opinion

12
that both the important witnesses namely, Deenu (PW-7) and
Ahmad  (PW-8)  made  improvements  in  their  statements.
Therefore, when the statements are contrary, facts are twisted
and improvements are made, no reliance can be made upon
such statement.
18.
Although, appellant  – Mohd. Jamil  (A2)  and Akhtar
Hussain  (A4)  were  tried  separately  and  the  statement  of
witnesses were recorded twice, firstly, in the trial against three
accused persons (Mohd. Yunus (A1), Mohd. Jamil (A2) & Ghasita
(A3))  and secondly, in the trial against Akhtar Hussain (A4), the
fact remains that both the star witnesses of the prosecution
namely Deenu (PW-7) and Ahmad (PW-8) are disbelieved in the
second  trial  by  clearly  stating  that  their  statements  are
contradictory,  the  facts  are  twisted  and  improvements  are
made. For trial under Section 302 IPC, if a witness is branded as
untrustworthy  having  allegedly  twisted  the  facts  and  made
contrary statement, it is not safe to impose conviction on the
basis of statement made by such witness. When there is an
effort to falsely implicate one accused person, statement made
by  such  an  eyewitness  cannot  be  relied  without  strong
corroboration.  Moreover,  there is material  on record proving

13
previous  enmity  between  the  parties  as  mentioned  in
paragraph 25 of the trial court judgment. 
19.
It  is  important  to  notice  that  the  Trial  Court  had
recorded a finding that recovery of Lathi from Mohd. Yunus (A1)
and  Kulhari  from Mohd. Jamil  (A2)  is  not  safe to rely upon,
meaning thereby, the recovery has not been proved. The Trial
Court found that the recovery of Pharsa from Ghasita (A3) is
fully proved. However, the appeal preferred by Ghasita (A3) has
already abated.
20.
Summing  up  the  quality  of  evidence  available  on
record, we have found that recovery of Kulhari from Mohd. Jamil
(A2) and Lathi from Mohd. Yunus (A1) has not been proved. The
deceased had sustained four injuries over his head. There are
allegations against Ghasita (A3) that he inflicted injuries over
the head  of the deceased on  more than  one occasion.  The
statement  of  eye-witness  Deenu  (PW-7)  and  Ahmad  (PW-8)
have not inspired confidence in the second trial against Akhtar
Hussain (A4).  The credibility of their evidence is under serious
doubt because of twisting of facts and improvements made.
Therefore, for all these reasons it is not safe to convict the
appellant- Mohd. Jamil (A2) for offence under Section 302 read

14
with  Section  34  IPC  on  the  basis  of  statement  of  such
eyewitness. 
21.
Accordingly, we set aside the impugned judgment of
the High Court and the Trial Court convicting the appellant-
Mohd.  Jamil  (A2)  for  offence  under  Section  302  read  with
Section 34 IPC. However, in view of the evidence on record
conviction  of  appellant-Mohd.  Jamil  for  the  offence  under
Section  323 read  with Section 34 IPC  is  not required  to be
interfered.  Resultantly,  Criminal  Appeal  No.  1308  of  2012
preferred by the appellant-Moh. Jamil (A2) is allowed in part
setting aside his conviction under Section 302 read with Section
34 IPC and, at the same time, maintaining his conviction and
sentence  under  Section  323  read  with  Section  34  IPC.  The
appellant-Mohd.  Jamil  (A2)  has  been  sentenced  to  undergo
rigorous imprisonment for six months for offence under Section
323 read with Section 34 IPC. As per the custody certificate, he
has  already  undergone  sentence  for  more  than  six  months.
Since, the appellant-Mohd. Jamil is on bail during the pendency
of this appeal, his bail bonds are discharged. 

15
22.
Criminal Appeal No. 1307 of 2012 preferred by the
State of Haryana challenging the acquittal of Mohd. Yunus (A1)
under Section 302 read with section 34 IPC stands dismissed.
