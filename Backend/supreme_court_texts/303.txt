No. 201 of 2005, titled “Satish Jain versus Rama & 
Ors.”, whereby the High Court set aside the order of 
the Trial Court dated 22.12.2004, and further 
directed the Trial Court to proceed in accordance 
with law to implement the award of the Arbitrator. It 
also rejected the objections of the appellant dated 
09.11.2004, and further the order rejecting the 
report of the Arbitrator was also set aside. The 
operative part of the impugned order as contained in 
the paragraph 27 thereof is reproduced hereunder: 
“27. Therefore, the order under revision is 
set 
aside. 
The 
objection 
dated 
09.11.2004 filed by respondent no.2 
stands dismissed. The order rejecting 
the report of the arbitrator is also set 
aside. The Trial Court shall proceed 
further 
according 
to 
law 
for 
implementing the award.” 
 
2. The relevant facts giving rise to the filing of the 
present appeal are briefly stated hereunder: 

 
Civil Appeal No. 6884 of 2012

(i). 
Satish Jain s/o Dayanand Jain instituted a 
civil 
suit 
impleading 
one 
Rama 
s/o 
Parasram as defendant No.1 and State of 
Madhya Pradesh through Collector, Bhopal 
as defendant No.2 praying for a decree of 
declaration, permanent injunction and 
mandatory injunction. It was registered as 
C.S. No. 65A of 1990. The basis of the claim 
was that the property in dispute being 
Khasra Nos. 48 & 49 area 3.53 acres 
situated in Village Halalpur, Tehsil Huzur, 
District Bhopal was owned by the State of 
Madhya Pradesh. However, defendant No.1 
was enjoying continuous and peaceful 
adverse possession over the suit land for the 
last 50-60 years and as such has perfected 
his rights by adverse possession and had 
become the owner of the land.  

 
Civil Appeal No. 6884 of 2012

(ii). It was further alleged that defendant No.1 
has transferred all his rights, title, and 
interest over the suit land in favour of the 
plaintiff 
and 
had 
also 
handed 
over 
possession of the suit land on 05.09.1988.  
(iii). Thereafter the plaintiff had erected wired 
fencing on 06.09.1988, and had been 
enjoying possession of the suit land. 
(iv). It is further alleged in the plaint that 
defendant No.1 was likely to transfer the 
said land again in favour of the 3rd party and 
he also came to know that some officers and 
employees of the State (defendant No.2) had 
visited the suit land and tried to remove the 
fencing. In such circumstances, the plaintiff 
was compelled to institute the suit for 
declaration, permanent injunction and 
mandatory injunction.  

 
Civil Appeal No. 6884 of 2012  
 
5 
 
(v). 
According to the plaintiff, the cause of 
action arose on 07.10.1988, and again on 
11.10.1988 when the officers/employees of 
the State tried to remove the fencing.  
(vi). The Trial Court decreed the suit ex-parte 
vide 
judgement 
and 
order 
dated 
22.06.1990.  
(vii). The State preferred an appeal under Section 
96 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 19082 
which was dismissed on the ground of delay 
of 8 days only by the IVth Additional District 
Judge, Bhopal.  
(viii). The State preferred a civil revision before 
the High Court which was registered as Civil 
Revision No. 300 of 2002. The said revision 
was allowed by the High Court vide order 
dated 13.08.2003. It set aside the order of 
 
2 In short, “CPC” 

 
Civil Appeal No. 6884 of 2012  
 
6 
 
the Appellate Court dated 11.05.1991, 
rejecting the application under Section 5 of 
the Limitation Act. It also condoned the 
delay of 8 days after allowing the application 
for condonation of delay, and further 
directed the Appellate Court to hear the 
parties on merits and decide the appeal in 
accordance with law. 
(ix). The said appeal was allowed vide order 
dated 09.01.2004 and the case was 
remanded to the Trial Court for deciding the 
same on merits after providing   reasonable 
time to the State to file its written 
statement. The said suit is still pending 
before the Trial Court.  
(x). It would be worthwhile to mention that the 
State has filed its written statement after 
remand by the Appellate Court.

(xi). In the meantime, it appears that the suit 
land was allotted to the Bhopal Municipal 
Corporation3 for constructing a bus stand. 
There is an agreement dated 30.07.1991 
entered between BMC and the plaintiff that 
the plaintiff would vacate the suit land, 
allowing the BMC to construct the bus 
stand, and in lieu, separate plots would be 
allotted to the plaintiff.  
(xii). It is also alleged that some allotments were 
made by BMC in favour of the plaintiff but 
they were later on cancelled.  
(xiii). After remand, written statement was filed 
by the State. Further, BMC was impleaded 
as defendant No.3 by order of Trial Court 
dated 13.03.2004.  
 
3 In short, “BMC” 

 
Civil Appeal No. 6884 of 2012  
 
8 
 
(xiv). The appellant filed an application under 
Order VII Rule 11 CPC and also under Order 
VI Rule 17 CPC on 17.08.2004.  
(xv). Further BMC filed an application under 
Section 89 of the CPC stating that under the 
agreement 
of 
30.07.1991 
plaintiff 
be 
directed to pay Rs. 30,00,000/- (Rupees 
Thirty lacs only) against the value of the 
allotted land. It was further stated that in 
case the full amount is deposited, BMC is 
ready to fulfil its obligations. It therefore 
prayed that the parties may be relegated to 
a Mediator/Arbitrator for settlement of the 
dispute under Section 89 CPC. This 
application is dated 27.08.2004.  
(xvi). The Trial Court, by order dated 17.09.2004, 
referred the matter to Shri Hemant Kumar. 
The said Arbitrator/Mediator in less than a 

 
Civil Appeal No. 6884 of 2012  
 
9 
 
month 
gave 
an 
award/report 
dated 
14.10.2004. In brief, the said award was to 
the effect that the plaintiff would pay Rs. 
30,00,000/- to BMC and such lease rent as 
maybe determined, and in turn the BMC 
would fulfil its obligation of allotment of 
land, 
as 
per 
the 
agreement 
dated 
30.07.1991.  
(xvii). 
The Appellant-State of Madhya Pradesh 
filed objections dated 09.11.2004 to the 
award of the Arbitrator dated 14.10.2004 
praying for setting aside the same on 
various grounds. It was specifically stated 
in the objections that the ownership of the 
land still remains with the State of Madhya 
Pradesh and that BMC had no business or 
right to deal with such land without the 
written consent or approval of the State.  

 
Civil Appeal No. 6884 of 2012  
 
10 
 
(xviii). 
The Trial Court, after inviting objections 
to the application of the State dated 
09.11.2004, allowed the same by order 
dated 22.12.2004. Aggrieved by the same, 
the plaintiff preferred a civil revision, which 
has since been allowed by the impugned 
order, giving rise to the present appeal. 
3. We have heard learned counsels for the parties and 
perused the material on record. 
4. It is an admitted position that the suit is still 
pending before the Trial Court. The plaintiff has not 
been granted any declaration as such till date. The 
ex-parte decree having been set aside, there was no 
occasion for the plaintiff to further act upon the 
agreement dated 30.07.1991 since no rights had 
crystallized to the parties. The basis of that 
agreement was the ex-parte decree of declaration 
and injunction in favour of the plaintiff. Once the ex-

 
Civil Appeal No. 6884 of 2012  
 
11 
 
parte decree has itself been set aside and the suit 
was to proceed further from the stage of filing of 
written statement by the Appellant- State, the 
agreement dated 30.07.1991 would lose all its 
credibility assuming there was any semblance of any 
right to enter into the agreement. The application 
filed by BMC under Section 89 CPC was also not 
maintainable 
based 
on 
the 
agreement 
of 
30.07.1991. There appears to be some kind of 
collusion between BMC and the plaintiff. Whether or 
not there was any condition in the agreement dated 
30.07.1991 for appointment of Arbitrator, the very 
basis of entering into the agreement having been set 
aside, the agreement itself could not have been 
relied upon by any of the parties. 
5. The suit land admittedly was owned by the 
Appellant-State. Even if the State had allotted it to 
BMC for constructing a bus stand, BMC could not 

 
Civil Appeal No. 6884 of 2012  
 
12 
 
have dealt with it and treated it to be in the 
ownership or possession of the plaintiff by entering 
into the agreement dated 30.07.1991. BMC would 
be bound as an allottee of the State to utilise the 
said land for the purpose for which it was given. It 
ought to have taken appropriate steps for removal of 
possession of the plaintiff which under law was 
totally unauthorised and illegal. 
6. A perusal of the agreement dated 30.07.1991 clearly 
mentions that the plaintiff was claiming right under 
the ex-parte decree dated 22.06.1990 and the 
dismissal of the First Appeal on 11.05.1991. Later 
on when both the orders had been set aside and the 
suit itself was to proceed from the stage of the 
Appellant-State filing its written statement, the 
agreement itself would not have any sanctity in the 
eye of law even inter se parties. The right created in 
the plaintiff under the ex-parte decree stood 

 
Civil Appeal No. 6884 of 2012  
 
13 
 
extinguished and, therefore, BMC ought to have 
been careful enough of not placing any reliance any 
further on the said agreement. The Trial Court was 
justified in allowing the application by setting aside 
the award. The High Court committed a grave error 
in not considering the relevant aspects and in 
placing reliance on the statement made by the 
Appellant- State before the Trial Court that the State 
had no interest inasmuch as it had allotted the land 
to BMC to set up a bus stand and therefore, it 
should be deleted from the array of parties as 
defendant no.2. In any case, all the applications are 
still pending before the Trial Court if not already 
disposed off or withdrawn by the State.  
7. In view of the above, the appeal deserves to be 
allowed and is accordingly allowed. The impugned 
order passed by the High Court is set aside. 

 
Civil Appeal No. 6884 of 2012

8. The Trial Court will proceed with the suit and decide 
the same on merits on the basis of evidence which 
may be led before it. 
9. There shall be no order as to costs. 
10. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.
