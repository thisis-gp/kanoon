Vide judgment and decree5, the Trial Court6 held the plaintiffs 
No.1 and 2 and defendants No.1 to 3 and 5 entitled to 1/6th share in the 
following property: 
“A schedule: Survey No.50/1, 86/2B, 69, 152/4 
B schedule: 87/A, 9A/2 
D schedule: Block No.9, B.No.170(8 Acres gunthas), CTS

Defendant no.2 was held entitled to Item 4 in Schedule-B.   
 
Defendant no.1 was held entitled to Item 3 in the 
Schedule-D.” 
 
 
 The suit pertaining to Regular Survey Nos.106/2, 120 and 9A/9 was 
dismissed.  No mesne profits were granted.  The suit was also dismissed 
against defendants No.6 to 9. 
5. 
 
Aggrieved against the judgment and decree of the Trial Court, 
two appeals were preferred before the High Court.  R.F.A. No.1463 of 
2007 was filed by the plaintiffs raising a grievance of rejection of their part 
claim.  R.F.A. No.1782 of 2007 was filed by defendants No.1 to 3 and 5, 
aggrieved against grant of 1/6th share each to the plaintiffs being

excessive.  Findings of the Trial Court with regard to the property at 
Sr.No.5 in Schedule-B (Regular Survey No.44/4) was also challenged.  The 
High Court disposed of both the appeals by a common judgment holding 
that: 
*  
Schedule-A properties (Regular Survey No(s).50/1, 106/2, 
86/2B, 69 & 152/4) are exclusive properties of defendant 
No.1 as these were allotted to him in the partition in the year 
1965.  Hence, the plaintiffs as well as the defendant No.1 will 
have 1/4th share each in the aforesaid properties.  
*  
The claim of the plaintiffs, for share in Schedule-B (Regular 
Survey No(s).120, 87A, 9A/2, 44/4) and Schedule-C 
properties (Regular Survey No.9A/9) and Item no.1 (Block 
No.9) and Item No.2 (Block No.170) of Schedule-D, was 
rejected.   
* 
Sale of Item No.2 (Regular Survey No.106/2) of Schedule-A 
property by defendant No.7 in favour of defendant No.9 was 
held to be null and void and not binding on the plaintiffs and 
defendant no.1.   
*  
Property at Item no.4 (CTS No(s).1292 & 1295) in Schedule-
D was to be shared equally by the plaintiffs and the 
defendant No.1 (1/12th share).   
*  
The matter regarding half share in Item No.3 (Block No.69) 
of Schedule-D was remitted to the Trial Court to allow the 

Page 7 of 21 
 
plaintiffs to adduce the evidence to prove that the same was 
purchased by the defendant No.1 out of the joint family 
funds.   
*  
The matter regarding Item no.5 (Regular Survey No.44/4) of 
Schedule-B was also remitted to the Trial Court.  The 
plaintiffs were held entitled to mesne profits from defendant 
No.1 of the properties in which they have been granted 
share. 
6. 
 
Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree of the High 
Court, the defendant No.7 (Srinivas Raghavendrarao Desai) filed two 
Special Leave Petitions.  Leave was granted. As he expired during the 
pendency of the matters before this Court, his legal representatives have 
been brought on record.  The issue raised in the present appeals is only 
pertaining to Regular Survey No. 44/4 and Regular Survey No.106/2, 
which was sold to defendant No.9 by defendant No.7 vide sale deed dated 
25.07.2001. 
 
 
Arguments 
7. 
 
Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the 
judgment of the High Court deserves to be set side for the reason that 
reliance has been placed upon 1965 partition which was not the pleaded 
case in the plaint initially filed.  No evidence led, which was beyond 

Page 8 of 21 
 
pleadings could be considered. An application seeking amendment of 
the plaint was filed to take up that plea, however, the same was declined 
by the Trial Court vide order dated 11.10.2006 and the order was not 
challenged any further. Even the pleadings to that effect sought to be 
taken in the replication filed by the plaintiffs were struck off by the Trial 
Court. The pleaded case of the defendants before the Trial Court was that 
there was a partition amongst the family members on 30.08.1984.  The 
aforesaid partition deed was subject matter of litigation in Civil Suit No. 
80 of 1995 filed by the defendant No. 2 wherein the same has been noticed 
and an order passed thereon.  
7.1   
The High Court had totally gone wrong in setting aside the 
decree dated 23.06.1995 without there being any challenge to the same 
by any of the parties. That issue did not arise out of the judgment of the 
lower 
Appellate 
Court. 
It 
was 
further 
submitted 
that 
the 
appellant/defendant No. 7 had not violated any interim order passed by 
the Trial Court as on the date such an order was passed, he was not even 
party to the litigation. He was impleaded only on 02.01.2001. 
8. 
 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents No. 1 
to 3/plaintiffs submitted that the entire effort of the appellants is just to 

Page 9 of 21 
 
deprive respondents No. 1 to 3 of their rightful share in the family 
property. The partition of 1965 was rightly relied upon by the High Court 
as against the partition of 1984, the genuineness of which is quite doubtful. 
In fact, all the family members had connived to deny rightful claim of the 
plaintiffs. It was further submitted that the sale deed which was executed 
by the appellant-defendant No. 7 in favour of defendant No. 9 in violation 
of the interim order passed by the Trial Court is non-est and deserves to 
be ignored. In support, reliance was placed upon the judgments of this 
Court in Jehal Tanti and others v. Nageshwar Singh (dead) through 
LRs,7  and Ghanshyam Sarda v. Sashikant Jha, Director, M/s J. K. Jute 
Mills Company Limoited and others8. He further argued that once the 
parties go to trial knowing the issues involved, the evidence led even 
without pleadings can very well be appreciated. In support, reliance was 
placed upon the judgment of this Court in Bhagwati Prasad v. 
Chandramaul9. 
8.1   
The property bearing Regular Survey No. 106/2 was sold by 
defendant No. 7 to defendant No. 9 to protect his interest. Even though the 
 
7 2013(14) SCC 689 
8 (2017) 1 SCC 599 
9 AIR 1966 SC 735 

Page 10 of 21 
 
sale was held to be bad by the High Court, no appeal has been preferred 
by defendant No. 9. Only defendant No. 7 has challenged the same. No 
doubt, the application for amendment of plaint to raise the pleading 
regarding 1965 partition was rejected, however, the High Court had 
made observations that defendant No. 7 is entitled to argue on the basis 
of the pleadings and documentary evidence to vindicate his right and also 
that the Trial Court is not barred to mould the relief and allot shares in 
accordance with law in a suit of partition. 
8.2   
 Learned counsel for defendant No. 9 adopted the arguments 
which were raised by learned counsel for the appellants as their interest 
is common and he is the bonafide purchaser of the property, which is a 
public institution, from defendant No. 7 on payment of consideration. 
9. 
 
In response to the submissions made by learned counsel for 
respondents No. 1 to 3, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that 
the stand taken by defendant No. 1 before the High Court was a clear 
somersault as his counsel sought to argue relying upon the proceedings 
before the Land Tribunal which was not even his pleaded case before the 
Trial Court.  The sale deed was executed by defendant No. 7 on 
25.07.2001. The same was well within the knowledge of defendant No. 1, 

Page 11 of 21 
 
however, he did not challenge the same during his life time, in case there 
was any error committed by defendant No.7. It was for the reason that the 
property had come to the share of defendant No. 7.  
10. 
 
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the 
relevant referred record.

12. 
 
The High Court finally found that the properties forming part 
of Schedule ‘A’ are exclusive properties of defendant No. 1 allotted in the 
partition in the year 1965. The plaintiffs and defendant No. 1 will have 1/4th 
equal shares each.  
12.1   
The claim of the plaintiffs for share in Schedule ‘B’, ‘C’ and item 
Nos. 1 and 2 of Schedule ‘D’ properties was rejected.  
12.2  
Sale of Item No. 2 of Schedule ‘A’ property by defendant No. 7 
to defendant No. 9 was declared to be null and void, hence not binding on 
the plaintiffs and defendant No. 1.  
12.3   
The plaintiffs and defendant No. 1 were held entitled to 1/4th 
share in item No. 4 of Schedule ‘D’. Meaning thereby 1/12th share each. 
12.4   
With regard to ½ share of item No. 3 of Schedule ‘D’ 
properties, the matter was remitted to the Trial Court to allow plaintiff No. 
1 to adduce evidence to prove that ½ share in item No. 3 was purchased 
by defendant No. 1 out of joint family funds.  
12.5   
In respect of item No. 5 of ‘B’ Schedule also, the matter was 
remitted to the Trial Court to allow defendants No. 2 and 7 to adduce 
necessary evidence as to extent of land allotted to the share of defendant 
No. 7 in the partition. In other words, it was to be decided whether it is 4 

Page 13 of 21 
 
acres in Sy. No. 44/4 of Nuggikere village is allotted to the share of 
defendant No. 7 or entire extent of 7 acres is allotted. The defendant No. 
7 and defendant No. 2 were permitted to file additional pleadings and 
adduce evidence available with them to prove their respective cases. 
13. 
 
In the written statement filed by defendants No. 1 to 3 (father 
and grand parents of plaintiffs No. 1 and 2) to the suit filed by the plaintiffs, 
the definite stand taken is that the property bearing Regular Survey No. 
106/2 does not belong to the joint family of the answering defendants, 
rather it had gone to the branch of Raghvendrarao, hence cannot be made 
subject-matter of partition. 
14. 
 
As is evident from the judgment of the High Court, much 
reliance was placed upon the oral partition effected between the parties 
in the year 1965. In our opinion, the High Court committed a grave error 
in placing reliance upon the partition allegedly effected in the year 1965, 
in terms of which Schedule ‘A’ properties were allotted exclusively to the 
share of defendant No.1. The fact remains that it is not even the pleaded 
case of the plaintiffs in the suit that there was any partition of the family 
properties in the year 1965. The suit was filed on 26.05.1999. Even the 
pleaded case of the defendants, especially defendant No. 1 who is the 

Page 14 of 21 
 
husband of plaintiff No. 3 and father of plaintiffs No. 1 and 2, in the written 
statement filed by him was not that there was any partition in the year 
1965. Quite late, the plaintiffs sought to amend the plaint seeking to raise 
pleadings regarding 1965 partition. The Trial Court, vide order dated 
11.10.2006 rejected the application for amendment of the plaint. The 
aforesaid order was not challenged any further. Meaning thereby, the 
same attained finality as far as the case sought to be set up by the plaintiffs 
based on 1965 partition.  
15. 
 
There is no quarrel with the proposition of law that no 
evidence could be led beyond pleadings. It is not a case in which there 
was any error in the pleadings and the parties knowing their case fully 
well had led evidence to enable the Court to deal with that evidence. In 
the case in hand, specific amendment in the pleadings was sought by the 
plaintiffs with reference to 1965 partition but the same was rejected. In 
such a situation, the evidence with reference to 1965 partition cannot be 
considered.  
16. 
 
The plea sought to be taken by the plaintiffs regarding 1965 
partition in the replication filed by them would not come to their rescue 

Page 15 of 21 
 
 for the reason that the amendment application filed to raise that plea was 
specifically rejected.  The Trial Court had rightly ignored the plea taken 
in the replication by the plaintiffs regarding oral partition of 1965, as 
amendment sought to that effect had already been declined. What was 
not permitted to be done directly cannot be permitted to be done 
indirectly. 
17.   
In the written statement filed by defendant No. 7, a specific 
plea was raised regarding 1984 partition and the property bearing 
Regular Survey No. 106/2 coming to his share. In the additional written 
statement filed by defendant No. 7 before the Trial Court, a specific plea 
was raised that the property bearing Regular Survey No. 44/4 had 
exclusively fallen to his share in the family partition effected on 
30.08.1984. This gets credence from a decree passed by the Civil Court 
in Civil Suit No. 80 of 1995, titled as “Sri Ramarao Vyasarao Desai v. Dr. 
Shriramarao Raghavendrarao Desi and another”, decided on 
23.06.1995, which notices the partition of 1984. In the aforesaid suit, father 
of defendant No. 1, who was the only son of Vyasrao and two sons of 
Raghvendrarao, namely, Prahlad and Srinivas Raghvendrarao were 
parties. The High Court had gone wrong in holding the aforesaid 

Page 16 of 21 
 
compromise decree to be bad without there being any challenge to the 
same by the parties. It is not even the case set up before the Trial Court. 
18. 
 
As a consequence, the finding recorded by the High Court that 
all Schedule ‘A’ properties were allotted to defendant No. 1 is liable to be 
set aside. Ordered accordingly. 
19. 
 
Strangely enough, there is somersault in the stand taken by 
defendant No. 1.  It is for the reason that earlier the plaintiffs and 
defendant No. 1 were stated to be at loggerheads as lot of allegations had 
been made by the plaintiffs in the plaint, such as playing cards, drinking 
etc. It is for that reason that the suit for partition was filed during the life 
time of the defendant No. 1.  However, now they have joined hands. As a 
result, defendant No. 1 before this Court is now seeking to support the 
case of the plaintiffs. Such conduct of the parties, like a pendulum in the 
clock in fact puts the Court on trial. 
20. 
 
If the contents of partition dated 30.08.1984 are perused, the 
property bearing Regular Survey No. 106/2 goes to the share of the 
appellant. Even otherwise, the property in question, namely, Regular 
Survey No. 106/2, on which the plaintiffs and defendant No. 1 are now 
staking claim was sold by defendant No. 7 to defendant No. 9 vide 

Page 17 of 21 
 
registered sale deed dated 25.07.2001. It was well within the knowledge 
of defendant No. 1. The Trial Court categorically recorded that even if the 
signatures on the sale deed were effected by defendant No. 7, stated to 
be executed on behalf of defendant No. 1, but still defendant No. 1 did not 
object to the same and in fact supported the stand of defendant No. 7 as 
the property in question had gone to his share in the family partition. 
Further, if defendant No. 1 was the true owner of the property in question 
and had any objection to the aforesaid sale transaction, during his life 
time he never challenged the same despite being in knowledge thereof.  
This also establishes that in fact in 1984 partition, the property had gone 
to the share of defendant No. 7.  The partition deed dated 30.08.1984 
between 
Vyasrao 
Hanamanthrao 
Desai 
and 
Raghavendrarao 
Hanamanthrao Desai, whose descendants are litigating with reference to 
their respective shares is extracted below:

Survey No. 109 of Saptapur has not been shown but, it has been 
included equally among the both the parties and consists of 
Guava garden.

Even with reference to property bearing Regular Survey No. 
44/4, also we do not find that the matter needs to be remanded back for 
the reason that in the family partition held in the year 1984 clearly the 
aforesaid Regular Survey No. was assigned to the share of late 
Raghavendrarao Hanamanthrao Desai, who was the predecessor-in-
interest of the appellants. The area clearly mentioned therein was seven 
acres, hence there is no dispute.

So far as the argument raised by learned counsel for the 
respondents regarding sale conducted by defendant No. 7 in favour of 
defendant No. 9 to be in violation of the interim order passed by the Trial 
Court is concerned, suffice it to state that the interim order restraining 

Page 20 of 21 
 
defendants No.1 to 4   from alienating the property in question was passed 
by the Trial Court on 31.05.1999. As on that date, defendant No. 7 was not 
party to the suit as he was impleaded only on 02.01.2001. There is no 
order passed by the Trial Court thereafter directing that the interim order 
was further extended qua the newly impleaded defendant also, hence it 
cannot be said to be a case of wilful violation of the order passed by the 
Trial Court.  
23. 
 
The order passed by High Court in Writ Petition No. 11431 of 
1977 filed by Sudheendra, decided on 25.03.1983, does not come to the 
rescue of the respondents for the reason that the same was passed before 
the partition was effected between the parties on 30.08.1984. Secondly, it 
was a Writ Petition filed by defendant No. 1 through his grand father as he 
was minor at that time. The Writ Petition was filed against the State 
seeking quashing of order dated 21.05.1976 passed by Special Land 
Tribunal, Dharwad.  Without there being any material and the parties 
affected or beneficiary of 1965 partition being party, the Court recorded 
that there is no dispute that there was such a partition. 
24. 
 
For the reasons mentioned above, the appeals are allowed. 
The findings of the High Court with reference to Regular Survey Nos.

106/2 and 44/4 are set aside. The same are held to be the properties 
coming to the share of the appellants. The sale deed executed by the 
appellant (since deceased) in favour of defendant No. 9 regarding Survey 
No. 106/2 is upheld.
