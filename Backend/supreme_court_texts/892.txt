on 14.12.1979.  He was dismissed from service on 03.11.1982 on  
account of incorrect punching of tickets on one occasion and on three 
occasions, passengers were found travelling without tickets when the 
appellant was on duty.  In appeal4, the order of dismissal was upheld 
vide order dated 19.10.1983.  Challenging the order of dismissal, the 
appellant filed a civil suit in the Court of Additional Munsiff Magistrate–
II, Jaipur City on 26.04.1986.  The suit was decreed on 31.03.2006.  The 
Trial Court5 held that the dismissal of the appellant was illegal as he was 
not granted fair opportunity of hearing.  The judgment6 and the decree 
of the Trial Court were challenged by the respondents by filing an 
appeal7.  The same was upheld by the First Appellate Court8 vide 
judgment and decree dated 29.03.2007.  Aggrieved, against the same, 
the respondents preferred second appeal before the High Court.  The 
same was allowed vide impugned judgment9 passed by the High Court 
on the ground that the Civil Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain 
the dispute as appellant should have invoked the jurisdiction under the 
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.  It is the aforesaid judgment of the High 
Court which is impugned in the present appeal by the appellant-

Both the learned counsels sought to raise arguments in 
support and against the judgment of the High Court. The appellant 
claimed that Civil Court had the jurisdiction to entertain the lis as there 
was complete violation of the principles of natural justice while 
awarding punishment.  On the other hand, the stand of the respondents 
was that Civil Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the lis as the proper 
remedy for the appellant was under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. 
4. 
 
Both the learned counsels for the parties have been heard.  
Considering the fact that the appellant was appointed as conductor with 
the respondent no.1-Corporation on 14.12.1979 and he was dismissed 
on 03.11.1982, it is apparent that the appellant served the respondent 
no.1-Corporation for about 03 years.  At present, considering the time 
gap ever since he was appointed, he must have attained the age of 
superannuation.  In our opinion, the ends of justice will be met if the 
appellant is awarded a lump sum amount of compensation of 
₹2,00,000/- instead of going into the merits of controversy either 
deciding jurisdiction of the Civil Court to entertain the lis or relegating 
the appellant to seek relief under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. 
5. 
 
For the reasons mentioned above, the impugned order

passed by the High Court is modified to the extent that the appellant is 
held entitled to a compensation of ₹2,00,000/- to resolve the entire 
controversy in hand. 
6. 
 
Accordingly, the Civil Appeal is disposed of with no order 
as to costs.
