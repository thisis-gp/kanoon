1. 
The facts of this case bring to light a situation 
marked by a persistent disregard for judicial 
directives and a lackadaisical approach to legal 
and financial obligations. The behaviour of the 
Petitioner stands as a testament to how an

individual’s 
nonchalant 
attitude 
towards 
financial responsibilities and court orders can 
undermine the essence of judicial efficacy.  
 
2. 
The High Court took a firm stance against the 
appellant’s continued failure to fulfil his 
financial 
obligations, 
culminating 
in 
the 
cancellation of his bail and suspension of 
sentence. 
This 
decision, 
reflecting 
the 
frustration of the legal system with repeated 
non-compliance, 
sets 
the 
stage 
for 
our 
deliberation. 
 
3. 
Leave granted. 
4. 
The present appeal assails the correctness of 
the judgment and order dated 23.07.2019 
passed by the High Court of Judicature at 
Bombay cancelling the order of suspension of 
sentence and bail granted to the appellant as

also the intervenor (petitioner before the High 
Court) vide order dated 03.07.2018 as they 
violated the undertaking given before the High 
Court on 03.07.2018 and recorded in the order 
of even date and further violated the condition 
contained in paragraph 3 of the order dated 
20.03.2019 granting extension of time to 
comply. 
5. 
The appellant-Satish P.Bhatt and the intervenor 
Vishwanath 
Ramakrishna 
Nayak 
were 
Chairman-cum-Managing Director and Vice-
Chairman of a company by the name of 
M/s.Astral Glass Private Limited (in short the 
AGPL). The company AGPL as also the appellant 
and the intervenor were convicted for offence 
under 
Section 
138 
of 
the 
Negotiable 
Instruments Act, 18811 vide judgment and

order of the Trial Court dated 26.08.2011 in 
three 
separate cases and were awarded 
sentence of ten months with total liability of 
Rs.5 crores cumulatively in all the three cases. 
The operative portion of the conviction and 
sentence as recorded by the Trial Court in one 
of the cases is reproduced hereunder: 
“I) Accused No.2 Mr.Satish Padamanath 
Bhat, aged 54 years and accused no.3

imprisonment for 6 (six) months each. 
III) Cash security of Rs.3000/- of accused 
no.2 shall stand continued till appeal 
period is over and P.R. bond of accused 
no.3 stands cancelled….” 
6. 
Three appeals jointly filed by the appellant, the 
intervenor as also AGPL were dismissed by the 
Sessions Court vide common judgment and 
order dated 30.01.2014.  The Sessions Court 
granted a month’s time to surrender in order to 
undergo the sentence.  
7. 
Aggrieved by the same, they preferred three 
revisions before the High Court as originally 
there were three complaints.  Before the High 
Court the appellant and the intervenor filed an 
undertaking 
based 
on 
a 
settlement 
on 
03.07.2018 according to which it was agreed 
that a total sum of Rs.4,63,50,000/-  would be 

Civil Appeal No.1598 of 2023 
 
Page 6 of 17 
 
paid to the complainant-respondent no.2.   Out 
of the said amount Rs.73,50,000/- had already 
been paid before the appeal Court. As such, the 
remaining amount of Rs.3,90,00,000/- was to 
be paid in installments.  The payment schedule 
was also laid down in paragraphs 6 and 7 
whereas paragraph 5 mentioned amount of 
settlement. Paragraph 8 of the settlement 
mentioned that the said amount would be paid 
equally by the appellant and the intervenor.  
However, in default of payment by either of them 
as per their agreed share in the settlement they 
would be held liable and would be prosecuted 
as per law.  
8. 
Based on the undertaking, the learned Single 
Judge of the High Court passed an order on the 
same day i.e. 03.07.2018 and granted interim 
protection by suspending the sentence of 

Civil Appeal No.1598 of 2023 
 
Page 7 of 17 
 
imprisonment and they were directed to be 
released on bail on furnishing a personal bond 
in the sum of Rs.25,000/- with one or more 
sureties in the like amount.  The Court further  
directed that no further extension shall be 
granted for payment of the settled amount and 
fixed 
8th 
October, 
2018 
for 
reporting 
compliance.   
9. 
As per the undertaking, Rs.2 crores was to be 
paid on or before 30th September, 2018, in 
addition to Rs.25 lakhs which was paid on the 
date of passing of the order. Remaining amount 
of Rs. 1 crore 65 lakhs was to be paid on or 
before 15th March, 2019. Thereafter the matter 
was taken up by the High Court on 20th March, 
2019 by which time they had paid only Rs.82 
lakhs. Further time was sought to pay the 
balance amount till 20th April, 2019. The 

Civil Appeal No.1598 of 2023 
 
Page 8 of 17 
 
counsel for the complainant pointed out that 
the amount due was Rs.1,69,10,000/-.  The 
High Court on 20.03.2019 extended the time for 
payment of Rs.1,69,10,000/- till 20th April, 
2019 and further provided that if the said 
amount was not paid then the order granting 
bail and also suspending the sentence shall 
stand cancelled forthwith without further 
reference to Court.  
10. Thereafter it appears that the present appellant 
Satish P.Bhatt filed a criminal application in the 
pending revision on 16th April, 2019 stating that 
he had paid his share of Rs.1,95,00,000/- being 
50% of Rs.3,90,00,000/- as mentioned in the 
order dated 3rd July, 2018 and, therefore, he 
may be absolved of the charges and acquitted.  
On the said application, notice was issued to the 
complainant on 19th June, 2019 fixing 10th July, 

Civil Appeal No.1598 of 2023 
 
Page 9 of 17 
 
2019.  On that date, it was adjourned to 16th 
July, 2019. Thereafter on 16th July it was 
adjourned to 23rd July, 2019.  On 23rd July, 
2019, the High Court passed the impugned 
order cancelling the suspension of sentence and 
bail granted vide order dated 3rd July, 2018 for 
non-compliance of the undertaking and in view 
of the order dated 20th March, 2019 wherein 
while extending the time it was observed that in 
case of default, the bail order and the 
suspension of sentence order would stand 
automatically withdrawn without reference to 
the Court. 
11. Learned counsel for the appellant has sought to 
argue that out of Rs.3,90,00,000/- his half 
share would amount to Rs.1,95,00,000/- which 
has duly been paid and, therefore, the order of 
the High Court cancelling his bail and 

Civil Appeal No.1598 of 2023 
 
Page 10 of 17 
 
suspension of sentence was not warranted and 
deserves to be set aside. 
12. On the other hand, learned counsel for the 
complainant has submitted that as of date there 
is 
still 
an 
outstanding 
amount 
of 
Rs.83,10,000/- and has, therefore, claimed that 
the complainant would be entitled to receive 
Rs.83,10,000/- along with compound interest @ 
12% p.a. from 15th March, 2019 till actual 
payment is made along with costs against the 
appellant as also the intervenor.  
13. The intervenor has also filed his response and 
according to him the partnership between the 
appellant and the intervenor was in the ratio of 
60:40 and that they had actually agreed to pay 
the settled amount of Rs.4,63,50,000/- in that 
proportion as per their shares in the firm.  It is 
also his case that the amount of Rs.73,50,000 

Civil Appeal No.1598 of 2023 
 
Page 11 of 17 
 
had been paid by him alone prior to 03.07.2018 
during the time when the appeal was pending 
before the Sessions Court and, therefore, he was 
entitled to adjustment of the said amount. 
Further his case is that out of the settled 
amount to be paid to the complainant i.e. 
Rs.4,63,50,000/- his share being 40%, the 
amount liable to be paid by him would be 
Rs.1,85,00,000/-. As he had paid Rs.73,50,000 
earlier he was liable to pay a further amount of 
Rs.1,11,90,000/-.  According to him, he has 
paid the said amount of Rs.1,11,90,000/- after 
the order dated 03.07.2018.  The outstanding 
amount of Rs.83,10,000/- falls in the share of 
the appellant whose total liability being 60% of 
the 
settled 
amount 
would 
come 
to 
Rs.2,78,10,000/- and he having paid only 

Civil Appeal No.1598 of 2023 
 
Page 12 of 17 
 
Rs.1,95,00,000/- 
there 
is 
a 
shortfall 
of 
Rs.83,10,000/- which the appellant should pay.   
14. It is further submitted that the intervenor is 
being 
unnecessarily 
suffering 
because 
of 
remaining amount not being paid by the 
appellant.  It is also the case of the intervenor 
that as per the e-mails exchanged between them 
which have been duly placed on record prior to 
the undertaking dated 03.07.2018, it was 
decided and agreed between them that the 
amount would be paid as per their respective 
shares i.e. in the ratio of 60:40. The said 
exchange of e-mails and the draft settlement 
was also shared with the lawyer and the same 
was duly accepted. The intervenor was not 
dealing with the lawyer directly and it was the 
appellant who was dealing with the lawyer. The 
appellant has mischievously and fraudulently 

Civil Appeal No.1598 of 2023 
 
Page 13 of 17 
 
altered the words “as per the respective shares” 
by substituting it with “equally”.  The intervenor 
was hurriedly made to sign the undertaking on 
the date it was being filed i.e. 03.07.2018 and 
he trusted the appellant and the lawyer who was 
appearing for both of them.  It is further stated 
that the intervenor has also filed before the High 
Court by way of a modification application to 
deal with this aspect of the matter, which 
application is still pending.  
15. We have perused the undertaking dated 
03.07.2018 as also the order dated 03.07.2018 
and also the subsequent orders passed by the 
High Court.  It is apparent from the same that 
the complainant was entitled to receive a total 
amount of Rs.4,63,50,000/-.  The undertaking 
as also the order dated 03.07.2018 clearly 
mention that both of them will pay the amount 

Civil Appeal No.1598 of 2023 
 
Page 14 of 17 
 
equally as agreed by and between them and it 
further contains a stipulation that in default of 
the payment by either of them as per their 
agreed share in the settlement, they shall be 
held liable and prosecuted as per law.   
16. The settlement between the two directors i.e. the 
appellant and the intervenor is inter se these 
two only and the complainant is not bound by 
the same.  Complainant’s agreement or consent 
was 
only 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
accepting 
Rs.4,63,50,000/- only. He was not a signatory 
to the agreement which was signed by the two 
parties. Admittedly, both the appellant and the 
intervenor were Chairman and Vice-Chairman 
of the company AGPL and, therefore, were 
convicted by the Trial Court and their conviction 
was affirmed by the Appellate Court. 

Civil Appeal No.1598 of 2023 
 
Page 15 of 17 
 
17. We are not inclined to go into this question as 
to who is to pay how much amount.  The fact 
remains that the total amount agreed to be paid 
has not been paid and as per the order of the 
High Court dated 20.03.2019 the revisionists 
being in default in payment of the agreed 
amount, the interim protection granted by way 
of bail and suspension of sentence, would stand 
withdrawn without reference to the Court. We 
find no infirmity in the impugned order.  
18. There is a protection provided by this Court vide 
order dated 26.08.2019 regarding stay of arrest, 
as a result of which the appellant and the 
intervenor 
have 
still 
not 
undergone 
the 
sentence. On the other hand, the complainant 
has still not reaped not only the fruits of the 
order dated 03.07.2018 but also of the order of 
the Trial Court dated 26.08.2011. He agreed to 

Civil Appeal No.1598 of 2023 
 
Page 16 of 17 
 
receive a much lesser amount than he was 
entitled to under the order of the Trial Court. He 
has been litigating since 2007 almost 16 years 
by now.   
19. We, accordingly, do not find any illegality in the 
order passed by the High Court.  The appeal is 
accordingly dismissed with costs quantified at 
Rs. 5 lakhs to be paid to the respondent No. 2 
(Complainant) within four weeks from today. It 
is clarified that this amount of costs will not be 
adjusted against the compensation awarded to 
the respondent No.2 but will be in addition to it. 
20. It is further directed that the appellant and the 
intervenor to surrender within a period of four 
weeks from today to undergo the sentence.  If 
they do not surrender, the High Court to take 
appropriate coercive measures to get the 
sentence executed. The revisions before the 

Civil Appeal No.1598 of 2023 
 
Page 17 of 17 
 
High Court are still pending. The High Court will 
proceed to decide the revisions as also pending 
applications if any and ensure that the 
undertaking is fully complied with and the 
complainant is suitably compensated for the 
further harassment caused. 
21. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.
