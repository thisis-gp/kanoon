The issue under consideration in the present appeals is 
regarding inter se seniority of the incumbents appointed to the post of 
Junior Engineer on direct recruitment basis and those whose posts of 
Sectional Officer, Grade-I, were upgraded to Junior Engineer. 
3. 
 
Final seniority list of Junior Engineers was circulated on 
26.03.2018 showing the seniority position of the incumbents manning 
the posts from two different sources.  Aggrieved against the seniority 
list, Sectional Officers, Grade-I, who were redesignated/upgraded as 
Junior Engineers challenged the same by filing W.P.(C)No.264(K) of 
2018 and W.P.(C) No.74(K) of 2019 filed by the respondent Nos.1 to 16 
herein.  The Learned Single Judge vide order dated 07.02.2020 
dismissed both the writ petitions.  Aggrieved against the judgment of 
the learned Single Judge in W.P.(C)No.74(K) of 2019, an intra-court 
appeal, W.A. No.4 of 2020 was filed.  The Division Bench of the High 
Court set aside the judgment of the learned Single Judge.  As a 
consequence, the impugned seniority list circulated on 26.03.2018 was 
set aside and the department concerned was directed to refix the 
seniority of the Junior Engineers in terms of the directions given in the 
judgment.

S.L.P.(C)No.1136 of 2022 are before this Court. 
4. 
 
Mr. P.S. Patwalia, learned senior counsel appearing for the 
directly recruited Junior Engineers/appellants in C.A. @ S.L.P.(C) 
No.17102 of 2021 submitted that they were selected as such after 
qualifying the exam conducted by the Nagaland Public Service 
Commission and appointed in the pay-scale of ₹6000-9750, vide 
Notification dated 01.05.2003.  Their selection and appointment were 
strictly in terms of the Nagaland Engineering Service Rules, 19971.  
Ever since their appointment they have been performing their duty 
diligently.   
4.1 
 
The contesting private respondents are incumbents who 
were earlier working in the cadre of Sectional Officers, Grade-I in the 
pay-scale of ₹4500-7000.  Their posts were upgraded to that of Junior 
Engineers by the Government of Nagaland vide Communication dated 
11.10.2007.  It was only thereafter that they entered in the cadre of 
Junior Engineer.  Prior to that they were working in a lower grade as 
compared to the direct recruits/Junior Engineers.   
                                                
1 The 1997 Rules 

Page 4 of 11 
 
4.2 
 
After the selection of the direct recruits, a number of 
tentative seniority lists were circulated starting from 31.05.2004.  
However, none of them were finalized.  It was only on 26.03.2018 that 
the seniority list was finalized.  The appellants herein were shown 
above the incumbents/respondents who entered in the grade of Junior 
Engineers after their post of Sectional Officer, Grade-I, was upgraded 
to Junior Engineer.  It was for the reason that the appellants have been 
working as Junior Engineer ever since their appointment vide 
Notification dated 01.05.2003 whereas the post of the Sectional Officer, 
Grade-I, was upgraded to that of Junior Engineers only vide 
Communication dated 11.10.2007.  Prior to that they were working on 
non-gazetted lower post of Sectional Officer, Grade-I.   
4.3 
 
Even otherwise if considered in terms of the 1997 Rules, the 
manner in which post of Sectional Officer, Grade-I, has been upgraded 
to Junior Engineer, is not the manner provided in which the post of 
Junior Engineer can be filled up.  Be that as it may, the appellants are 
not aggrieved with that action of the State, in case they are granted 
proper position in the seniority list.  The result of the judgment of the 
Division Bench of the High Court is that the private respondents have 
been assigned seniority in the cadre of Junior Engineers from the date 
on which they were not even born in the cadre, which is legally 

Page 5 of 11 
 
impermissible.  In support of the arguments reliance was placed upon 
the judgments of this Court in State of Uttaranchal and Another v. 
Dinesh Kumar Sharma2, P. Sudhakar Rao and Others v. U. Govinda 
Rao and Others3 and Ganga Vishan Gujrati and Others v. State of 
Rajasthan and Others4. 
5. 
 
As the State is also aggrieved by the Judgment of the 
Division Bench of the High Court, in furtherance to the arguments 
raised on behalf of the directly recruited Junior Engineers, Mr. K.N. 
Balgopal, learned senior counsel appearing for the State in C.A. @ 
S.L.P.(C)No.1136 of 2022, submitted that the judgment of the Division 
Bench is based on certain wrong facts/premise.  The Learned Judge 
had tried to trace out the history from 1997 onwards, which was not 
relevant for the lis to be examined.  It is a case in which inter-se 
seniority was to be determined after the first ever direct recruitment to 
the post of Junior Engineer was made on 01.05.2003.  Prior to that Junior 
Engineers were being appointed by upgrading different posts.   
5.1 
 
There is no dispute that the private contesting respondents 
herein were not Junior Engineers as on the date when the direct 
recruitments were made.  The private contesting respondents were 
                                                
2 (2007) 1 SCC 683, [2006] Supp. 10 SCR 1, 2006 INSC 944 
3 (2013) 8 SCC 693, [2013] 13 SCR 540, 2013 INSC 420 
4 (2019) 16 SCC 28, [2019] 11 SCR 444, 2019 INSC 938

promoted on an officiating basis as Sectional Officers, Grade-I, on 
different dates.  The Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) was 
held on 16.03.2007 to consider regularization of their officiating 
promotion.  Officiating promotion of Sectional Officers, Grade-I, in the 
pay-scale of ₹4500-7000 was regularized vide Office Order dated 
31.03.2007.  Even if they had been working as Sectional Officer, Grade-
I, from any date prior to 16.03.2007, the same does not come to their 
rescue for the reason that they were working on a lower post.  Sectional 
Officer, Grade-I, is a promotional post from Sectional Officer, Grade-II.   
6. 
 
In response, Mr. Rana Mukherjee, learned senior counsel 
appearing for the contesting private respondents, who were the writ 
petitioners before the High Court in W.A. No.4 of 2020 submitted that 
Office Order dated 31.03.2007 clearly shows that the private contesting 
respondents were deemed to be promoted from various dates as 
Sectional Officers, Grade-I, as their officiating promotion was 
regularized.  The dates as are available in the aforesaid Office Order 
in most of the cases was prior to the date of appointment of the 
appellants in C.A. @ S.L.P.(C)No.17102 of 2021.  Hence, they were 
rightly granted seniority from that date as it was that post which was 
subsequently upgraded to Junior Engineer.  There is no error in the 

Page 7 of 11 
 
order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court and both the 
appeals deserve to be dismissed. 
7. 
 
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the 
relevant referred record. 
8. 
 
The undisputed facts in the case fall in a very narrow 
compass. There are two sets of employees working as Junior 
Engineers.  The appellants in C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.17102 of 2021 are the 
incumbents who were selected by the Nagaland Public Service 
Commission and were appointed as Junior Engineers vide Notification 
01.05.2003.  The private contesting respondents who were the writ 
petitioners and appellants before the Division Bench of the High Court 
in W.A.No.4 of 2020 were working as Sectional Officer, Grade-I and the 
post on which they were working was upgraded to that of Junior 
Engineer (Class-II Gazetted), vide letter dated 11.10.2007.  The pay-
scales on which the Sectional Officer, Grade-I, were working was 
₹4500-7000 whereas the pay-scales on which Junior Engineer (Class-II 
Gazetted), were working was ₹6000-9750. 
9. 
 
As stated before us, the post of Junior Engineer was 
governed by the 1997 Rules in terms of which 90% recruitment is to be 
done by direct recruitment and 10% by way of promotion.  As stated 

Page 8 of 11 
 
before us, prior to 2003 selection by the Nagaland Public Service 
Commission no direct recruitment was made. Any seniority list of 
Junior Engineer which may have been circulated earlier will not have 
any bearing in the case in hand.  After the direct recruitment of the 
Junior Engineers a tentative seniority list was circulated on 31.05.2004.  
Its finalization remained pending for years.  During the interregnum 47 
posts of Sectional Officer, Grade-I, working in the Nagaland Public 
Works Department were upgraded to Junior Engineer (Class-II 
Gazetted) vide Letter dated 11.10.2007.  After considering claims and 
objections of all the incumbents working in the cadre of Junior 
Engineers, the seniority list was finalized on 26.03.2018.   
10. 
 
The appellants in C.A.@S.L.P.(C)No.17102 of 2021 were 
shown at Serial Nos.71, 72, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 & 80 in the aforesaid 
seniority list; they being the direct recruits.  Respondent Nos.1 to 16 
who were earlier working as Sectional Officer, Grade-I, the post which 
was subsequently upgraded as Junior Engineer vide letter dated 
11.10.2007 were shown at Serial Nos.156, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 
141, 142, 143, 144, 157, 158, 159, 174 & 179.  
11. 
 
Aggrieved against the aforesaid seniority list, two writ 
petitions were filed before the High Court.  W.P.(C) No.74(K) of 2019   
was filed by the respondent Nos.1 to 16 herein whereas 

Page 9 of 11 
 
W.P.(C)No.264(K) of 2018 was filed by 29 other incumbents who were 
earlier working as Sectional Officer, Grade-I, the post which was 
upgraded to Junior Engineer vide order dated 11.10.2007. 
12. 
 
Learned Single Judge rightly dismissed both the writ 
petitions as the Sectional Officer, Grade-I, whose post was upgraded 
only on 11.10.2007 as Junior Engineers could not be treated to be 
senior to the Junior Engineers who were directly recruited on 
01.05.2003.  The impugned seniority list as circulated on 26.03.2018 
was upheld. 
13. 
 
A perusal of the impugned order of the Division Bench of 
the High Court shows that it had totally misdirected itself while 
examining the 1997 Rules; the date of appointment of the private 
contesting respondents as Sectional Officer, Grade-I and the date of 
their regularization as such.  The aforesaid facts were not of any 
relevance for the decision of the question of seniority amongst the 
members of the cadre of Junior Engineers.  All what was required to be 
considered was the date on which they became members of the cadre 
of Junior Engineers coming from two different sources.  As to whether 
the upgradation of the post was right or wrong is not an issue canvassed 
before this Court.  The Division Bench of the High Court has further 
gone wrong in considering the upgradation of post of Sectional Officer 

Page 10 of 11 
 
and certain other posts to that Junior Engineers prior to 01.05.2003 
when direct recruitment to the post of Junior Engineers was made for 
the first time.  That historical background did not have any relevance 
for the reason that prior to 2003 never before in the cadre of Junior 
Engineers there was recruitment from two different sources.  The 
dispute arose only thereafter.   
14. 
 
The dates on which the Sectional Officer, Grade-I, were 
promoted as such either on officiating basis or their promotions were 
regularlised though as per the Order dated 31.03.2007 effective from 
the date when the DPC was held i.e. 16.03.2007 will not have any 
bearing on the case in hand.  Even if the Sectional Officer, Grade-I, are 
treated to be working from the date they were officiating as such, 
nothing hinges on that as far as the seniority in the cadre of Junior 
Engineers is concerned.  It is for the reason that the post of Sectional 
Officer, Grade-I, on which they were working was upgraded to that of 
Junior Engineer (Class-II Gazetted) vide letter dated 11.10.2007.   
15. 
 
The pay-scales of Sectional Officer, Grade-I, was ₹4500-
7000 and the Junior Engineer was having pay-scales of ₹6000-9750.  
Meaning thereby that they were working on a lower non-gazetted post.  
The dispute in the present appeals is only pertaining to the Sectional 
Officer, Grade-I, whose posts were upgraded on 11.10.2007 and not 

Page 11 of 11 
 
those whose posts were upgraded prior to the direct recruitment vide 
Notification dated 01.05.2003.  The blatant error committed by the 
Division Bench of the High Court is that upgraded Sectional Officer, 
Grade-I, are directed to be given seniority in the cadre of Junior 
Engineers from a date on which they were not even born in the cadre 
as it was only after 11.10.2007 upgradation order that they became 
Junior Engineers, which was much after the direct recruitment made on 
01.05.2003. 
16. 
 
For the reasons mentioned above, appeals are allowed.  
The impugned order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court is 
set aside.  The seniority list of the Junior Engineers as circulated on 
26.03.2018 is upheld.  There shall be no order as to costs.
