FACTUAL ASPECTS 
1. 
The benefit of a personal/promotional pay scale was 
granted to the appellants by the State of Uttarakhand. The said 
benefit was withdrawn under a subsequent decision of the 
State of Uttarakhand. The narrow question is whether the

benefits can be recovered from the appellants who have 
superannuated. 
2. 
Few factual aspects need consideration. The undivided 
Government of Uttar Pradesh issued an order dated 16th June 
1988 by which the appellants were appointed on an ad hoc 
basis in the State Ayurvedic and Unani Medical Service Cadre.  
The appointments were expressly made for a period of one year 
or till the State Public Service Commission provides the duly 
selected candidates.  A decision dated 5th February 1998 of the 
Government of Uttar Pradesh provided that any medical officer 
working on an ad hoc basis shall be considered for 
regularisation upon completing continuous and satisfactory 
service of 8 years.  However, it was clarified that the benefit of 
personal payment should be approved only after their 
regularisation in service.  It was specifically made clear that if 
any medical officer has completed 8 years of continuous service 
but has not been regularised, the benefit of the personal pay 
band will be admissible only after he is regularised.  On 2nd 
December 2000, a decision was made by the government that 
officers/employees who completed continuous and satisfactory 
service of 8 years in the same post on or after 1st January 1996 
shall be provided a salary increment in the revised pay band.  
It was also decided that the officers who have been granted the 
aforesaid benefit and who have completed continuous and 
satisfactory service of 6 years from the date of getting the 
benefit of selection grade to a total of 14 years of continuous 
and satisfactory service shall be approved on the next pay-band 

          C.A. 5933 OF 2023 etc.

or promotional post on a personal basis.  It was clarified that 
the benefit be available to those who have been regularised on 
the concerned post. 
3. 
The first respondent, by an office memorandum dated 
27th January 2006, regularised the appellants' employment.  
The appellants filed writ petitions before the High Court.  The 
grievance was regarding the non-grant of the promotional pay 
scale.  The writ petitions were disposed of by the order dated 
3rd January 2011, directing the State Government to consider 
their claim for the grant of a promotional pay scale.  On 8th 
March 2011, the first respondent – the State Government, 
granted approval for applying a new ACP (Assured Career 
Progression Scheme) in the revised pay structure from 1st 
January 2006 for the State Government employees.  On 4th 
August 2011, the Chief Secretary of the State Government 
issued a communication to the Director General of Ayurvedic 
and Unani Services, which reads thus:  
“In the light of G.O. No.2178/71-2-2010-
519/2005 Dt. 18th June, 2010 of Govt. of 
U.P, Medical Education Section-2, I have 
been directed to say that with regard to G.O. 
No. 7468/71-2- 5/92 Dt. 5th February, 
1998, the benefit of personal/promotional 
pay-scale 
(i.e. 
08/14 
years) 
shall 
be 
admissible to Ayurvedic and Unani Medical 
Officers and Medical Officers (Community 
Health) only after their regularization. It 
means that whenever concerned medical 
officer shall be regularized at that time 
while considering his entire satisfactory 
service on ad hoc basis to be regular, 
individual/promotional pay-scale shall be 

          C.A. 5933 OF 2023 etc. 
 
Page 4 of 11 
 
admissible upon completion of 08/14 
years of service.” 
(emphasis added) 
4. 
On 27th September 2011, in terms of the directions issued 
by the Chief Secretary, the Director of the Ayurvedic and Unani 
Services of the first respondent granted a time-bound pay band 
to the appellants in terms of the order dated 4th August 2011. 
As some of the appellants were not given the benefit of the order 
dated 4th August 2011, they filed a writ petition before the High 
Court.  By the order dated 7th May 2013, the High Court 
directed the State Government to consider granting the next 
higher pay scale or pay to the appellants on completion of 14 
years of service in terms of the Government decision dated 4th 
August 2011 not later than three months.   
5. 
The State Government made an application for recall of 
the said order dated 7th May 2013 on the ground that the order 
dated 4th August 2011 issued by the Principal Secretary was 
not consistent with the orders issued by the Finance 
Department.  A submission was made that though the said 
order was issued by Shri Rajiv Gupta, the Principal Secretary, 
after the approval of the Hon’ble Chief Minister, the relevant 
orders may not have been noticed by the Hon’ble Chief 
Minister.  By the order dated 4th March 2014, the application 
for recall made by the State Government was rejected by a 
Division Bench of the High Court. It was held that the decision 
taken by the Hon’ble Chief Minister remains valid unless the 
Cabinet of the Government expressly withdraws the decision. 
While rejecting the application, a direction was issued to 

          C.A. 5933 OF 2023 etc. 
 
Page 5 of 11 
 
implement the order dated 4th August 2011. By a decision 
dated 29th May 2014, the State Government cancelled the order 
dated 4th August 2011 on the ground that it was contrary to 
the Government orders of the Finance Department. 
6. 
It appears that the State Government made one more 
application before the High Court based on the order dated 29th 
May 2014.  By the order dated 28th August 2014, the High 
Court observed that the Government was at liberty to act in 
accordance with the order dated 29th May 2014. It was also 
observed that if any parties were aggrieved by the said Order, 
they could always approach a proper forum.  Notwithstanding 
the said Order of the High Court, by the order dated 9th October 
2014, the State Government granted higher pay to those 
Ayurvedic Medical Officers who had completed 16 years and 26 
years of continuous service.  By the order dated 27th October 
2014, the Principal Secretary of the Government ordered 
recovery from the appellants on the basis of the cancellation of 
the order dated 4th August 2011.  This action of recovery, as 
well as the order dated 29th May 2014, were challenged by the 
appellants by filing writ petitions, which have been dismissed 
by the impugned judgment and order.   
SUBMISSIONS 
7. 
The learned senior counsel for the appellants submitted 
that the Government order dated 5th February 1998 issued by 
the erstwhile State of Uttar Pradesh was binding on the first 
respondent in view of Section 86 of the Uttar Pradesh 
Reorganisation Act, 2000.  He submitted that the Government 

          C.A. 5933 OF 2023 etc. 
 
Page 6 of 11 
 
order dated 4th August 2011 merely reiterates the Government 
order dated 5th February 1998.  He submitted that in the earlier 
writ petition, the High Court had held that the decision dated 
4th August 2011 was a decision of the State Government.  He 
submitted that the order of recovery was passed without giving 
an opportunity of being heard to the appellants.  He submitted 
that the benefits were granted to the appellants based on the 
valid orders, which have been recalled for no fault on their part.  
He submitted that, in any event, the order of recovery needs 
interference, 
especially 
when 
the 
appellants 
have 
superannuated. The learned counsel for the first respondent 
justified the impugned order.   
OUR VIEW 
8. 
We have perused the Government Order dated 5th 
February 1998, which records that the service rendered by the 
Medical Officers on an ad hoc basis shall be taken into account 
for computing 8 years of continuous satisfactory service.  
However, it also provides that they should be given the benefit 
of personal pay only after the regularisation of their service.  
The order issued by the Principal Secretary, Department of 
Ayush, the Government of Uttarakhand, on 4th August 2011 
provided that after the regularisation, the ad-hoc services 
rendered by the Ayurvedic Medical Officers shall be taken into 
consideration for the grant of personal/promotional pay scale, 
which is payable on completing 8/14 years of service.   It is 
true that the order dated 7th May 2013 passed by the High 
Court records the statement of standing counsel for the State 

          C.A. 5933 OF 2023 etc. 
 
Page 7 of 11 
 
of Uttarakhand that the order dated 4th August 2011 conveys 
the decision of the State Government.  In view of this decision, 
a direction was given by the High Court to consider the cases 
of the appellants for grant of the next higher scale of pay upon 
completion of 14 years of service.  By the order dated 4th March 
2014, while deciding the recall application filed by the State 
Government, the High Court observed that the decision dated 
4th August 2011 was taken by the Hon’ble Chief Minister of the 
State and therefore, unless the Cabinet expressly withdraws 
the same, it will continue to operate.  
9. 
Thereafter, on 22nd August 2014, the State Cabinet came 
to the conclusion that the order dated 4th August 2011 was 
contrary to the Government Order issued by the Finance 
Department and accordingly, the order dated 29th May 2014 
was passed, recalling the order dated 4th August 2011.  
10. 
We have carefully perused the order dated 29th May 2014. 
It is noted in the said order that the Government order dated 
8th March 2011 issued by the Finance Department, applicable 
to all service cadres of the State, directed that three financial 
upgradations be given to all personnel of the State under 
certain conditions on the post of direct recruitment after 
completion of continuous satisfactory service of 10, 18 and 26 
years respectively from the first appointment.  The order dated 
29th May 2014 notes that, however, under the order dated 4th 
August 2011, the personal/promotional pay scale was made 
admissible after 8 and 14 years of service only to the Ayurvedic 
and Unani Medical Officers. Therefore, it was observed that a 

          C.A. 5933 OF 2023 etc. 
 
Page 8 of 11 
 
special class of Ayurvedic and Unani Medical Officers was 
created who have been given a different treatment.  It is 
observed that though the Finance Department had objected to 
issuing the order dated 4th August 2011, the opinion of the 
Finance Department was overruled, and the same was issued 
without the approval of the Cabinet.  That is how the Cabinet, 
on 22nd May 2018, decided to cancel the order dated 4th 
August 2011.  We find no error in the view taken by the State 
Government as there was no valid reason to grant a higher pay 
scale only to the Ayurvedic and Unani Medical Officers after 
continuous satisfactory service of 8 years, whereas, for all other 
Government servants, satisfactory continuous service of 10 
years was required. 
11. What is relevant is the order dated 28th August 2014 
passed by the Division Bench of the High Court.  The said order 
reads thus:  
“We are afraid, order passed by this Court 
dated 07.05.2013 as well as order passed on 
the Recall Application dated 04.03.2014, 
cannot 
be 
reviewed, 
merely, 
because 
subsequent to the passing of the orders 
under review order dated 04.08.2011 has 
been recalled. However, we find that it was 
specifically made clear by this Court in the 
order dated 04.03.2014 that till decision 
is taken by the Cabinet on the order dated 
04.08.2011, it has to be implemented. 
Since, order dated 04.08.2011 has already 
been 
revoked/cancelled, 
therefore, 
Government is at liberty to act upon in 
accordance with Government Order dated 
29.05.2014. Petitioner, if so aggrieved the 
order 
29.05.2014, 
may 
approach 
the 

          C.A. 5933 OF 2023 etc. 
 
Page 9 of 11 
 
appropriate forum assailing the Government 
order dated 29.05.2014.” 
(emphasis added) 
 
12. 
Notwithstanding the liberty granted under the order 
described above to the State Government to act upon the order 
dated 29th May 2014, by the order dated 9th October 2014, 
higher pay scales were granted to the appellants based on the 
order dated 4th August 2011.  Thereafter, the Government 
passed the order dated 27th October 2014 ordering recovery of 
the amounts paid to the appellants according to the Order 
dated 4th August 2011.  However, it was mentioned therein that 
earlier orders granting personal/promotional pay with effect 
from the date of regularisation, i.e. 27th January 2006, are 
revived.  The order also accepts that the Medical Officers will 
be entitled to ACP benefits made available under the orders 
dated 8th March 2011 and 1st July 2013. The order of recovery 
reads thus:  
“The recoverable amount first be adjusted 
from the arrears payable on the basis of the 
ACP 
benefit 
made 
admissible 
to 
the 
concerned Medical Officers under the finance 
department's govt. order no. 872 dated 
08/03/2011 and govt. order no. 589 dated 
01/07/2013 and even after that some 
amount still remains to be recovered, a 
maximum of 1/3 of the total of pay and 
dearness allowance of the concerned Medical 
Officers be fixed as an installment per month 
and recovery of the remaining amount be 
ensured to be made.” 
13. 
As held earlier, under the order dated 4th August 2011, 
the benefit of personal/promotional pay scale was granted only 

          C.A. 5933 OF 2023 etc. 
 
Page 10 of 11 
 
on Ayurvedic Medical Officers upon completing 8 and 14 years 
of service.  The said order was contrary to the order of the 
Finance Department and, therefore, was rightly withdrawn as 
we have held earlier. We may note here that by the order dated 
8th November 2006, the personal time-bound pay scale was 
granted to the appellants, subject to the condition that if the 
Government takes any decision to the contrary, the amount 
will be recovered from the salary of the concerned medical 
officers. 
14. 
While dealing with the refund issue, the High Court has 
held that the appellants, being Ayurvedic Medical Officers, do 
not belong to a weaker section of the society and, therefore, 
recovery will not be inequitable.  Moreover, even after the grant 
of monetary benefits in terms of the Government Order dated 
4th August 2011, the designation of the appellants, their duties 
and responsibilities remained the same.  Therefore, the High 
Court was right in not setting aside the order of recovery.  
15. 
Learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants 
relied upon the judgment and order dated 26th August 2022 
passed by this Court in Civil Appeal No. 5527 of 2022 (M.P. 
Medical Officers Association vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh 
and Ors.), which granted relief to the employees against 
recovery.  From paragraph 5 of the said decision, it is evident 
that the same has been rendered in peculiar facts and 
circumstances of the case.  This Order was passed after holding 
that the law laid down by this Court in the case of State of 

          C.A. 5933 OF 2023 etc. 
 
Page 11 of 11 
 
Punjab v. Rafiq Masih1 may not be applicable.  Therefore, the 
said decision rendered in the peculiar facts of the case will have 
no application.  In the facts of the case in hand, what stares at 
the face is that the benefits granted only to the Ayurvedic and 
Unani Medical Officers under the Order dated 4th August 2011 
were not extended to any other category of the State 
Government employees.  No material was brought on record to 
show how and why favourable treatment was given to the 
appellants. 
16. 
Therefore, we are unable to interfere with the view taken 
by the High Court.  The appeals are, accordingly, dismissed.  
As observed in the order dated 27th October 2014 passed by 
the State Government, the appellants will be entitled to ACP 
benefits made available under the orders dated 8th March 2011 
and 1st July 2013. Therefore, if any consequential benefits 
accrue based on the said two orders with time, the appellants 
will be entitled to the same.   Needless to add, the recovery shall 
be made, as specified under the order dated 27th October 2014.
