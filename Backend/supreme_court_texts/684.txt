The landlady is in appeal before this Court impugning
the judgment of the High Court1 passed in Writ Petition2 filed by
the respondent-tenant.  The challenge in the Writ Petition was
against the  common  judgment  dated  12.05.2006 passed  by
Additional District Judge, Jhansi in SCC Revision No. 40 of 2003

and  SCC  Revision  No.  47  of  2003,  filed  by  the  respondent-
tenant and appellant-landlady, respectively.   
2.
As is evident from a perusal of the orders passed in
the case in hand, eviction of the respondent-tenant was sought
by  the appellant-landlady  on  the ground  of non-payment  of
rent.  The Eviction Suit3 was filed by the appellant-landlady
claiming that she is the owner of the House No. 129 situated at
Laxmi  Gate,  Jhansi  where  the  respondent-tenant,  now
represented through legal representatives, was inducted as a
tenant on monthly rent of ₹5.26.  The allegation was that the
respondent-tenant had not paid the rent since 14.09.1991.  The
appellant-landlady  got  the  notice4 under  Section  106  of the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 served on respondent-tenant on
15.11.1997 but no rent was paid till 15.12.1997.  It was at this
stage that the suit for recovery of arrears of rent and eviction of
the respondent-tenant was filed.  
2.1
The  Trial  Court  decreed  the  suit  directing  the
respondent-tenant  to  handover  vacant  possession  of  the
property in question to the appellant-landlady within one month

4 Dated 11.11.1997

besides  payment  of  compensation  at  the  rate  of  ₹50/-  per
month from the date of filing of the suit.  
2.2
Aggrieved, against the judgment passed by the Trial
Court, both the parties preferred separate revisions before the
Additional  District  Judge,  Jhansi.   The  grievance  of  the
appellant-landlady  was  against  the  part  of  the  Trial  Court
judgment holding the deposit of rent made by the respondent-
tenant under Section 30(2)5 of the Act as valid, whereas the
respondent-tenant  had  challenged  the  judgment  of  the  Trial
Court  against  the  direction  of  eviction  of  respondent-tenant
from the property in question along with compensation.
3.
The  revision  filed  by  the  respondent-tenant  was
partially allowed only to the extent that the rate of damages as
fixed by the Trial Court was reduced from  ₹50 to  ₹5.26 per
month.  Whereas the revision filed by the appellant-landlady
was allowed holding that the deposit of arrears of rent by the
respondent-tenant under Section 30(2) of the 1972 Act was not
valid.  The respondent-tenant challenged the aforesaid common
judgment passed by the Revisional Court before the High Court
5 The Uttar Pradesh Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 
[U.P. Act No. 13 of 1972]

by filing Writ Petition bearing Writ-A No. 30694 of 2006.  The
same was allowed by the High Court.  As a consequence, the
suit filed by the appellant-landlady was dismissed.
4. 
Admittedly, Moti Lal was the owner of the property in
question. Son of Moti Lal, i.e., Ram Sevak had predeceased him
and  when  Moti  Lal  died  intestate on  08.02.1982,  his  widow
Gomti Bai and Meera Devi, his daughter-in-law (widow of Ram
Sevak), inherited the property in question. One Pramod Kumar
Pandey staked his claim in the property in question through an
unregistered Will6 allegedly made by Late Moti Lal in his favour.
Gomti Bai and Meera Devi filed a suit7 seeking declaration that
the  unregistered  Will  is  fake,  illegal  and  void,  and  Pramod
Kumar Pandey has no right on the basis of the said Will in the
property in question.  The suit was decreed in favour of Gomti
Bai and Meera Devi whereby the Court pronounced that Late
Moti Lal died intestate on 08.02.1982 leaving behind Gomti Bai
and Meera Devi as his legal heirs, and the alleged unregistered
Will is forged, fabricated, illegal and void, and Pramod Kumar
Pandey does not have any right in the property in question.
Consequently, Gomti Bai and Meera Devi became owners of the

property in question.  So, ownership of the appellant-landlady is
not in dispute.
5.
A perusal of the paperbook shows that notice was
issued on 02.01.2014 in the Special Leave Petition8.  Vide order
dated  02.05.2014,  leave  was  granted  and  a  perusal  of  the
same order shows that during the pendency of the appeal the
respondent-tenant  was  directed  to  pay  rent  at  the  rate  of
₹4,000/- per month.  The basis therefor was that during the
pendency of the Writ Petition before the High Court, an interim
order9 was passed directing the respondent-tenant to pay the
rent at the rate of  ₹4,000/- per month.  The said order was
challenged  before  this  Court  and  upheld  vide order  dated
11.12.2006 passed in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 19859 of
2006.  
6.
The order dated 02.05.2014 is extracted below : 
“Leave granted.
We  notice  that  by  order  dated
18.10.2006,  the  Allahabad  High  Court  had
directed  the respondent  to  pay  rent  at  the
rate of  ₹4,000/- (Rupees four thousand only)
8 Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 24655 of 2012
9 Dated 18.10.2006
Page 5 of 8

per  month.  The  said  order  was  carried  in
appeal to this Court and this Court vide order
dated 11.12.2006 dismissed the special leave
petition.
We,  therefore,  direct  the respondent  to
pay rent at the rate of ₹4,000/- per month to
the  petitioner  during  the  pendency  of  this
appeal.”
7.
When the matter was taken up before this Court for
final  disposal,  Shobha  Devi  Tripathi,  daughter  and  legal
representative  of  Late  Meera  Devi,  filed  an  affidavit  dated
21.02.2024.  In paragraph 3 thereof, it has been specifically
mentioned that though initially the respondent-tenant paid the
amount fixed by this Court but he has not paid the same from
March 2017 onwards.  Even though the original respondent-
tenant has expired, his legal representatives who are on record,
are also neither paying the rent fixed by this Court nor handing
over the vacant possession of the property in question to the
appellant-landlady.
8.
In reply to the aforesaid affidavit, no response was
filed  by  the  respondent-tenant,  thereby  the  averments  of
affidavit remained undisputed that from March 2017 onwards,
Page 6 of 8

the respondent-tenant has not paid the rent till date thereby
failing to comply with the order dated 02.05.2014.  Hence, the
statement  of  default  in  compliance  of  order  passed  by  this
Court remains uncontroverted.
9.
In any rent proceeding, the Courts can always take
the  subsequent  facts  into  consideration,  which  may  be
relevant. Here is a case where the respondent-tenant has failed
to comply with the interim order passed by this Court regarding
payment of rent during the pendency of the appeal before this
Court, and hence, is in default.  In any proceeding of eviction of
tenant on the ground of non-payment of rent, he is not only
bound to offer the arrears of rent on account of non-payment of
which eviction is sought for but also to pay the future rent
regularly, either at the amount agreed between the parties or
as fixed by the Court.  Even on failure to pay the rent during the
pendency  of  the  litigation  also  the  tenant  is  bound  to  be
evicted.
10.
In view of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the
view that the case falls in that category where the respondent-
tenant has failed to comply with the order passed by this Court
Page 7 of 8

dated  02.05.2014,  directing  payment  of  rent  at  the  rate  of
₹4,000/- per month, from March 2017 onwards.  Hence, the
respondent-tenant, who is now represented through his legal
representatives/heirs, is directed to be evicted forthwith.  The
present  appeal  is  accordingly  allowed  setting  aside  the
judgment of the High Court.  However, it is made clear that the
appellant-landlady shall have right to recover the arrears of
rent from the respondent-tenant as determined by this Court
for the period of default by initiating appropriate proceedings, if
so advised.
