AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. 
1. 
This Appeal is preferred against the judgment and 
order dated 18.10.1996 passed by the High Court of 
Kerala at Ernakulam (hereinafter referred to as “the 
impugned judgment”), upholding the order of 
conviction and sentence passed by the Sessions 
Court, of the Appellant/Accused No. 01 under 
Sections 302 and 201 of IPC for the murder of one 
Gouri during the night of 16th-17th August 1989, at 
the house of Accused No. 02. The sentence included

life imprisonment under Section 302 and seven 
years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 201 of 
IPC. The Accused No. 02 was found guilty under 
Section 201 of IPC receiving a sentence of four year 
rigorous 
imprisonment. 
Against 
the 
order 
of 
conviction and sentence, two separate appeals were 
preferred by the Appellant-Accused No. 01 and 
Accused No. 02. These appeals came to be dismissed 
by the impugned judgment, upholding the conviction 
and sentence of both the accused/appellants 
therein. However, the present Appeal is preferred by 
Accused No. 01 only. 
 
2. 
The story as made out by the prosecution is that the 
body of a woman was discovered in a paddy field by 
PW1-V.T. Manikandan, while he was going for work 
in the morning of 17.08.1989. He informed the 
police, and based on his statement, PW38-C.P. 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 3 of 28 
 
Vijayamani, a Sub Inspector, registered a case of 
unnatural death at the Parappanangadi Police 
Station. This witness visited the scene, took 
photographs, 
and 
collected 
fingerprints. 
The 
postmortem examination was conducted by PW33-
Dr. M. Kunjukrishnan, on 18.08.1989, at 10:30 AM. 
He reported finding six antemortem injuries on the 
left side of the head fractured into multiple 
fragments, as well as abraded contusions on the 
right wrist and left knee. Injuries on the head were 
determined to be sufficient to cause death under 
ordinary circumstances and could have been 
inflicted with a weapon such as a coconut scraper 
(MO-20). According to the medical expert, the time of 
occurrence of death was approximately 30 to 35 
hours before the postmortem examination. PW2-V.T 
Lakshmi and PW3-V.T Ambika, mother and sister of 
deceased with some local people identified the dead 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 4 of 28 
 
body of Gouri. The case was investigated by PW39- 
K.V Satheesan, who submitted the final report 
against the Appellant and Accused No. 02.  
 
3. 
To prove the guilt of the accused, prosecution 
proceeded to establish motive for the murder by 
asserting that there was illicit relationship between 
the Appellant and Accused No. 02. This relationship 
had developed for the reason that the husband of 
Accused No. 02 was living abroad, leaving her to 
reside alone with her two children, which lead to the 
two accused coming close. The deceased, Gouri, was 
related to Accused No. 02 and since this accused 
was living alone, the deceased would frequently visit 
her house and even stayed there overnight. 
 
4. 
When the relationship between the Appellant and 
Accused No. 02 was discovered and local opposition 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 5 of 28 
 
increased, the Appellant at the suggestion of 
Accused No. 02, entered into a registered marriage 
with Gouri on 17.05.1989, in an attempt to cover up 
his relationship with Accused No. 02. It is also 
brought on record, that the said marriage was 
dissolved by way of another deed dated 31.07.1989. 
It was alleged that there were letters which were 
exchanged between the two accused indicating their 
intimacy and love for one another, albeit under 
assumed names. However, there was no evidence 
which was brought on record especially the factum 
that these letters were indeed written by these two 
accused in the form of some handwriting expert etc.  
 
5. 
The narrative put forward by the prosecution is that 
on the date of incident both the accused and 
deceased Gouri were at the house of Accused No. 02. 
An altercation occurred between the Appellant and 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 6 of 28 
 
the 
deceased 
with 
reference 
to 
Appellant’s 
relationship with Accused No. 02. It is alleged that 
during this confrontation, Appellant grabbed a 
coconut scrapper from the kitchen and hit Gouri on 
the head multiple times, leading to her death. The 
prosecution has further projected that the Appellant 
dragged the body out of the room and thereafter 
carried it outside the house to the paddy field, which 
is about 1KM away, where it was left. He then came 
back to the house of Accused No. 2 and left for his 
destination the following morning.  
 
6. 
The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant 
contends that the case is solely based upon 
circumstantial evidence, with no eyewitness to the 
occurrence of the incident. He asserts that the 
courts below have misread the evidence and 
misguided themselves in coming to the conclusion 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 7 of 28 
 
that the prosecution established a convincing chain 
of circumstances based on material evidence and 
witnesses, leading to the Appellant’s conviction and 
sentence. He argues that there exist glaring gaps in 
the evidence produced by the prosecution, creating a 
doubt regarding the incident much less the 
Appellant’s involvement in the alleged offense.  
 
7. 
He further submitted that for the prosecution to 
establish a case based on circumstantial evidence, 
must complete the chain of events that leads to an 
inescapable conclusion of accused’s guilt, with no 
room for alternative explanation(s). He points out 
several shortcomings in the evidence presented by 
the prosecution with regard to the sequential 
occurrence of the incident and circumstances 
surrounding the death of Gouri. He has highlighted 
the said aspects with reference to the evidence 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 8 of 28 
 
including deposition and cross examination of the 
witnesses. 
Consequently, 
he 
asserts 
that 
the 
prosecution has failed to establish the guilt of the 
Appellant beyond reasonable doubt. Prayer has thus 
been 
made 
for 
allowing 
the 
present 
Appeal 
and acquittal of the Appellant. 
 
8. 
On the other hand, the Learned Counsel for the 
State has made an effort to explain out the 
circumstances supporting the prosecution’s case 
based on evidence led by the prosecution. He thus 
supported the findings of the courts below as also 
the conviction and sentence awarded to the 
Appellant. He prays for dismissal of the present 
Appeal.  
 
9. 
Having heard the Learned Counsel for the parties 
and with their assistance having gone through the 
evidence carefully as presented by the prosecution, it 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 9 of 28 
 
is apparent and has not been disputed that there is 
no eyewitness of the incident in question, and 
therefore, the case of the prosecution is solely based 
upon 
circumstantial 
evidence. 
This 
casts 
an 
enhanced burden on the prosecution to demonstrate 
an unbroken chain of events that establishes the 
accused’s 
guilt 
for 
the 
alleged 
offense. 
The 
prosecution is required to prove that there is 
continuity in the sequence of events leading to an 
ultimate conclusion of offense being committed by 
the accused and no one else.  
 
10. Before proceeding further, it would be appropriate to 
mention the principles as have been enunciated and 
settled by this Court, which would determine the 
parameters within which the case of the prosecution, 
if based on circumstantial evidence, is to be tested 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 10 of 28 
 
with regard to the establishment of the offence 
stated to be committed by the Appellant.  
 
This Court in the case of Ramreddy Rajesh Khanna 
Reddy and Another v. State of A.P.1 while referring 
to the various earlier judgments which have been 
passed by this Court from time to time, summarized 
key principles which act as a guide for the courts to 
come to a conclusion with regard to the guilt of an 
accused in cases which are solely dependent on the 
circumstantial evidence. The same have been 
referred to as the “panchsheel principles” and are 
discussed in paragraph 26 to 28 of the said 
judgment, which read as follows: 
 
26. It is now well settled that with a view to 
base a conviction on circumstantial 
evidence, the prosecution must establish 
all 
the 
pieces 
of 
incriminating 
circumstances by reliable and clinching 
evidence and the circumstances so 
 
1 (2006) 10 SCC 172 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 11 of 28 
 
proved must form such a chain of events 
as would permit no conclusion other 
than one of guilt of the accused. The 
circumstances cannot be on any other 
hypothesis. It is also well settled that 
suspicion, however grave it may be, 
cannot be a substitute for a proof and 
the courts shall take utmost precaution 
in finding an accused guilty only on the 
basis of the circumstantial evidence. 
(See Anil 
Kumar 
Singh v. State 
of 
Bihar [(2003) 9 SCC 67 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 
1167] 
and Reddy 
Sampath 
Kumar v. State of A.P. [(2005) 7 SCC 
603 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1710] ) 
 
27. The 
last-seen 
theory, 
furthermore, 
comes into play where the time gap 
between the point of time when the 
accused and the deceased were last seen 
alive and the deceased is found dead is 
so small that possibility of any person 
other than the accused being the author 
of the crime becomes impossible. Even 
in such a case the courts should look for 
some corroboration. 
 
28. In State of U.P. v. Satish [(2005) 3 SCC 
114 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 642] this Court 
observed: (SCC p. 123, para 22) 
“22. The last-seen theory comes into 
play where the time-gap between 
the point of time when the accused 
and the deceased were last seen 
alive and when the deceased is 
found 
dead 
is 
so 
small 
that 
possibility of any person other than 
the accused being the author of the 
crime becomes impossible. It would 
be 
difficult 
in 
some 
cases 
to 
positively 
establish 
that 
the 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 12 of 28 
 
deceased was last seen with the 
accused when there is a long gap 
and possibility of other persons 
coming in between exists. In the 
absence 
of 
any 
other 
positive 
evidence 
to 
conclude 
that 
the 
accused and the deceased were last 
seen 
together, 
it 
would 
be 
hazardous to come to a conclusion 
of guilt in those cases. In this case 
there is positive evidence that the 
deceased and the accused were 
seen together by witnesses PWs 3 
and 5, in addition to the evidence of 
PW 2.” 
(See 
also Bodhraj v. State 
of 
J&K [(2002) 8 SCC 45: 2003 SCC 
(Cri) 201].) 
 
11. Thereafter, the above principles have been reiterated 
in the subsequent judgments of this Court and hold 
the field till date.  
Thus, these basic established principles can be 
summarized in the following terms that the chain of 
events needs to be so established that the court has 
no option but to come to one and only one 
conclusion i.e. the guilt of the accused person. If an 
iota of doubt creeps in at any stage in the sequence 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 13 of 28 
 
of events, the benefit thereof should flow to the 
accused. Mere suspicion alone, irrespective of the 
fact that it is very strong, cannot be a substitute for 
a proof. The chain of circumstances must be so 
complete that they lead to only one conclusion that 
is the guilt of the accused. Even in the case of a 
conviction where in an appeal the chain of evidence 
is found to be not complete or the courts could reach 
to any another hypothesis other than the guilt of the 
accused, the accused person must be given the 
benefit of doubt which obviously would lead to his 
acquittal. Meaning thereby, when there is a missing 
link, a finding of guilt cannot be recorded. In other 
words, the onus on the prosecution is to produce 
such evidence which conclusively establishes the 
truth and the only truth with regard to guilt of an 
accused for the charges framed against him or her, 
and such evidence should establish a chain of 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 14 of 28 
 
events so complete as to not leave any reasonable 
ground for the conclusion consistent with the 
innocence of accused.  
 
12. It needs a mention here that although both the 
accused were put to trial to face charges under 
Section 302, 201 read with Section 34 of IPC, but 
they were acquitted of the charge of Section 34 of 
IPC, as it has been not established rather finding 
was returned that there was no common intention 
prior to the commission of the offence. Accused No. 
02 was held guilty under Section 201 of IPC (causing 
disappearance of evidence) only, and was thus, 
sentenced to four years of imprisonment. 
 
13. At this point, it is apposite to discuss the relevant 
testimonies 
and 
evidence 
presented 
by 
the 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 15 of 28 
 
prosecution aimed at establishing the guilt of the 
Appellant and Accused No. 02. 
 
14. The prosecution presented the testimony of PW2-V.T 
Lakshmi and PW3-V.T Ambika (mother and sister of 
deceased respectively) who in their testimonies 
stated that the deceased Gouri told them that she 
was going to the house of Accused No. 02 and they 
saw the deceased going till the turn towards the 
house of Accused No. 02 at around 7:30 PM on the 
date 
of 
incident 
i.e., 
16.08.1989. 
They 
also 
acknowledged the fact that Accused No. 02 is related 
to them and they regularly visited each other’s house 
and had cordial relations.  
 
15. The factum that the deceased had gone to the house 
of Accused No. 02 at around 7:30 PM on the date of 
incident is not disputed as the two children of 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 16 of 28 
 
Accused No. 02 who are PW10-T.K. Ramya and 
PW11- T.K. Radhesh have also stated in their 
statement that deceased was present in their house 
in the evening of 16.08.1989. However, they have 
added that she had left the house at around 9:00 PM 
and did not return thereafter.  
 
16. As regards the Appellant, the evidence which has 
been brought on record by the prosecution to 
establish his presence in the house of Accused No. 
02 is the statement of PW14-K.V. Raman, who had 
stated that he had seen the Appellant entering the 
house of Accused No. 02 at around 11:30 PM on the 
date of incident.  
PW20-K. Majeed, a taxi driver has been produced by 
the prosecution, who had stated that he saw the 
Appellant 
at 
5:30 
AM 
on 
17.08.1989 
at 
Parappanangadi bus stand, heading towards the 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 17 of 28 
 
railway station. He further stated that the Appellant 
was wearing a coffee brown shirt, white spotted lungi 
and a bath towel was tied around the head.  
 
17. These are the two witnesses who have been 
produced to establish presence of the Appellant in 
the house of Accused No. 02 on the date of incident. 
PW-14 is stated to have seen the Appellant going to 
the house of Accused No. 02 at 11:30 PM in the 
night of incident and PW-20 has seen the Appellant 
leaving the town, the following morning. They are the 
two witnesses who can be said to be the star 
witnesses as far as the presence of the Appellant in 
the house of Accused No. 02 is concerned at the 
night of incident. 
 
18. Another witness who can be said to be crucial for the 
prosecution case is PW18-Sirajudheen from whose 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 18 of 28 
 
possession and presence, recovery of a bag allegedly 
belonging to the Appellant was made on 27.08.1989.  
Blood-stained clothes, a blanket and a head towel 
belonging to the Appellant are said to have been 
recovered from this bag. The prosecution claims that 
these articles belong to the Appellant and the 
recovery was made on his behest in the presence of 
PW-18 on 27.08.1989. This witness has actually 
blown off the lid and falsified the case of prosecution 
by stating that a police constable visited his shop on 
23.08.1989 and took away the bag in question from 
him. Subsequently, on 27.08.1989 police came in a 
police jeep and handed him the same bag which was 
taken from him earlier and opened it, showing 
articles as stated above, and got his signatures on 
the prepared Mahazar. It was at this moment he saw 
the Appellant sitting in the police jeep. This 
discrepancy 
casts 
a 
serious 
doubt 
on 
the 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 19 of 28 
 
prosecution story regarding recovery of bag and 
articles contained therein at the behest of the 
Appellant in the presence of PW18 and that too on 
27.08.1989.  
 
19. As regards the discovery of blood stains, cloth 
stained with blood and coconut scrapper (MO 20) 
from the house of Accused No. 02 in the presence of  
of the three witnesses i.e., PW-26 to 28 is concerned, 
none of them have categorically stated that the 
police has seized anything in their presence, rather 
to the contrary they have stated that they were not 
taken to the spot and were only shown the cotton 
swabs stained with blood and other clothes which 
were said to have been recovered from the house of 
Accused No. 02. PW27-M. Muhammed in his 
statement stated that police showed him the coconut 
scrapper and cotton swab and he was told that same 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 20 of 28 
 
were taken from the rooms of Accused No. 02’s 
house. A similar statement was made by PW28, V. 
Dasan, who stated that he did not know where the 
police obtained these material objects from.  
 
20. When the evidence, as has been presented by the 
prosecution is tested on the standard of proof and 
parameters discussed above, we are unable to accept 
the conclusions as reached by the courts below 
while convicting and sentencing the Appellant. 
 
21. As regards Accused No. 01-the Appellant, the first 
and foremost evidence which is required to be 
established is with regard to his presence in the 
house of Accused No. 02 at the time when deceased 
Gouri was also there. It is then and only then that it 
would have been possible for the Appellant to have 
committed murder of Gouri. Apropos, Gouri’s 
presence in the house of Accused No. 02, there is 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 21 of 28 
 
ample 
evidence 
to 
that 
effect, 
including 
the 
statements of PW10 and PW11, both children of 
Accused No. 02, who were very much present in the 
house. Their evidence, which has gone unchallenged 
clearly establishes the factum that deceased Gouri 
had left the house at around 9:00 PM on 
16.08.1989. Nothing has come on record which 
would indicate to the contrary, that is with regard to 
she having returned or continued to stay back at the 
house of Accused No. 02.  
 
22. The evidence which has been brought on record by 
the prosecution in the form of statement of PW14, 
who has claimed to have seen the Appellant entering 
the house of Accused No. 02 at 11:30 PM on 
16.08.1989, belies the aspect of the Appellant having 
committed the murder of deceased, as prior thereto, 
the deceased had already left the house in question. 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 22 of 28 
 
Another aspect which needs to be pointed out is that 
this witness has not come face to face with the 
Appellant rather he stated that he had only seen the 
back of the Appellant. This witness acknowledges 
that he assumed that the person he had seen on the 
date of incident entering the house of Accused No. 
02 was the Appellant as the Appellant typically has 
been doing so at odd hours. This creates doubt in 
the story of prosecution, as the presence of deceased 
and the Appellant in the house of Accused No. 02, at 
the same time on the day of the incident which was 
essential for commission of the murder of deceased 
by the Appellant in the said house, is not 
conclusively proved by the evidence led by the 
prosecution.  
 
23. As 
regards 
the 
recoveries 
which have 
been 
affected especially with regard to the weapon of 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 23 of 28 
 
offence from the house of Accused No. 02, suffice to 
say that those being made not in the presence of 
independent witnesses, as has been so deposed by 
PW26 to PW28 and discussed above, the same 
cannot be relied upon. 
 
24. Similar is the position with regard to the recovery of 
the bag from PW18, which contained the Appellant’s 
blood-stained clothes, as well as a blanket with 
blood stains and other articles.  PW18, the witness 
of recovery, has expressed a doubt with regard to the 
contents of the bag. He has testified that the bag 
was handed over to him by the Appellant, 2-3 days 
prior to 23.08.1989, and on this very date a police 
constable came and had taken the bag, and he was 
not shown the contents of the said bag. Thus, as per 
this witness the bag in question was handed over by 
him to the police on 23.08.1989 whereas, as per the 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 24 of 28 
 
recovery memo, this bag was recovered and seized 
on 27.08.1989, when the police party came along 
with the Appellant in a police jeep and opened it 
showing the articles contained therein and the 
witness was made to sign the Mahazar. The said 
recovery which is alleged to have been made at the 
instance of Appellant, thus cannot be accepted as 
the same is not borne out from the evidence of the 
witness. Rather the possibility of the articles having 
been planted in the bag cannot be ruled out.  
 
25. Additionally, relying on the testimony of PW20, the 
prosecution suggested that after killing Gouri, the 
Appellant left the town in between 5:00-5:30 AM on 
17.08.1989. As per the case of the prosecution, the 
Appellant having disposed of the body in the paddy 
field, returned to the house of Accused No. 02 and 
thereafter left again for his destination. A perusal of 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 25 of 28 
 
the testimony of PW20, does not indicate as to from 
where the Appellant was actually coming from when 
this witness saw him. Additionally, this witness has 
stated that he had seen the Appellant from a 
distance, that too very early in the morning. 
Assuming this testimony to be true, it is not 
established that the Appellant was coming from the 
house of Accused No. 02.  
 
26. Another aspect that further casts a doubt with 
regard to the identity of Appellant is that the clothes 
which are alleged to have been worn by the 
Appellant while going to the house of Accused No. 02 
as per PW14, and clothes he was wearing while 
returning as per PW20, were not produced in the 
court to be identified by these witnesses. It is not the 
case of the prosecution that these clothes were put 
to these two witnesses for identification thereof, 

Criminal Appeal No. 291 of 2023                        Page 26 of 28 
 
which are alleged to have been worn by the 
Appellant at the time of commission of the offence. 
 
27. As per the case of prosecution, the time of death of 
the deceased Gouri has got to be after 11:30 PM, as 
it has been held by the courts that it is the Appellant 
alone who had committed her murder. The body 
obviously would have been disposed of prior to 5 AM 
on 17.08.1989. It has come on record that the 
distance between the house of Accused No. 2 and 
the paddy field where the body was found is about 1 
KM; in between there is a sawmill which runs 24 
hours. If the case of the prosecution is to be 
accepted, according to which the Appellant had 
carried the dead body of the deceased Gouri on his 
shoulder from the house of Accused No. 02 to the 
paddy fields, someone would have most likely seen 
him on the way, especially when there was a

running mill in between from where the Appellant is 
said to have crossed. This further raises a doubt 
with regard to the credibility of the case as has been 
projected by the prosecution. 
 
28. In the light of the above, when tested upon the anvil 
of the principles and parameters laid down by this 
Court, as referenced earlier, the prosecution has 
miserably failed to indicate the involvement of the 
Appellant in the commission of the offence, what to 
say of establish, for which he was charged. The 
chain of circumstances which are being sought to be 
projected by the prosecution to be complete has 
glaring holes and significant gaps, which leads this 
Court to come to the conclusion that the prosecution 
has failed in its endeavour of bringing home the guilt 
against the Appellant. The case having not been 
proved what to say of beyond reasonable doubt

against the Appellant, the impugned judgments 
cannot sustain and are set aside.  
 
29. The Appellant is acquitted of all the charges. In case 
the Appellant has been released on bail, the bail 
bonds and the sureties, if any, are hereby 
discharged. The Appellant be set free forthwith.  
 
30. The Appeal is allowed in the above terms.
