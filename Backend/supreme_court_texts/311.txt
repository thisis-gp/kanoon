3. 
At the outset, it would be relevant to mention that 
the sole ground on which the quashing was sought 
was that this was a second FIR on the same set of 
allegations made by the complainant after two 
weeks of lodging the first FIR being FIR No. 19 of 
2015 under Section 498A read with Section 34 IPC, 
Police Station, Hisar, Haryana. 
 
4. 
The relevant facts are briefly stated hereunder: 
(i). 
The appellant and respondent No.3 came in 
contact with each other in June, 2014 
through internet.  
(ii). 
The complainant (respondent No.2) who is 
the father of respondent No.3 had visited 
the appellant in Udaipur, who is a 
Chartered Accountant based in Hisar, for 
proposal of marriage of his daughter 
(respondent No.3) who was at that time 
posted as Deputy Superintendent of Police 
at Udaipur, Rajasthan. 
(iii). On 18.02.2015 engagement took place and 
thereafter on 21.03.2015, the marriage was 
solemnised at Udaipur. On 10.10.2015, the 
respondent No.2 filed a complaint at Police 
Station, Hisar, Haryana under Section 498A 

SLP(CRL.) NO. 2520 OF 2017 
 
Page 3 of 11 
 
IPC etc. The said complaint was registered 
at Police Station Hisar on 17.10.2015 as FIR 
No. 19 of 2015 under Section 498A read 
with Section 34 IPC. 
(iv). In 
the 
meantime, 
respondent 
No.2 
submitted 
another 
complaint 
on 
15.10.2015 i.e. five days after the first 
complaint at the Police Station, Udaipur in 
the State of Rajasthan on the same set of 
allegations as in the previous complaint. 
This complaint came to be registered on 
01.11.2015 as FIR No. 156 under Section 
498A/506 IPC etc. 
(v). 
In the first FIR No. 19 of 2015 along with 
the appellant other family members were 
also roped in. However, after further 
investigation, a Police Report under Section 
173(2) Cr.P.C. was submitted in December, 
2015 only against the appellant under 
Section 498A IPC. Based on the said Police 
Report, the Magistrate took cognizance and 
the trial proceeded and a case was 
registered as Crl. Case No. 232-I of 2015, in 
the Court of Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, 
Hisar. 

SLP(CRL.) NO. 2520 OF 2017 
 
Page 4 of 11 
 
(vi). In the meantime, the appellant filed a 
petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. before 
the Rajasthan High Court for quashing of 
the second FIR No. 156 of 2015 registered 
at Udaipur. By the impugned order, the 
High Court has dismissed the said petition 
on 06.03.2017 primarily on two grounds. 
Firstly, that the complaint at Udaipur was 
prior in point of time than the complaint in 
Hisar. The second ground was that the 
Rajasthan Police was not aware of the 
earlier proceedings/complaint before the 
Hisar Police and as such the Udaipur Police 
should be at liberty to investigate the said 
complaint made at Udaipur.  
(vii). Aggrieved by the impugned order, the 
present petition was preferred before this 
Court on which notice was issued on 
03.04.2017, and this Court also stayed 
further investigation in the FIR No. 156 
dated 
01.11.2015 
P.S. 
Women 
Police 
Station, Udaipur, until further orders. As 
such the said FIR has not been investigated 
so far. 

SLP(CRL.) NO. 2520 OF 2017

(viii). After the impugned order was passed, the 
trial at Hisar was concluded, and the Trial 
Court vide judgement dated 02.08.2017 
acquitted the appellant. Copy of the said 
judgment has been placed along with 
additional documents (I.A. No. 118201 of 
2021). 
(ix). A perusal of the judgment and order of 
acquittal reflects that the prosecution 
examined ASI Sheela Devi Investigating 
Officer as PW-1 who proved the Police 
Papers, Head Constable Raja Ram as PW-2, 
who proved the documents relating to 
marriage etc., Jaipal Singh, DSP as PW-3, 
who also proved some of the police papers, 
and Sub Inspector Mane Devi as PW-4, who 
had prepared the Challan upon completion 
of the investigation. 
(x). 
The Trial Court further records that 
prosecution tried its best to secure the 
presence of the complainant and the victim 
but they did not turn up to depose before 
the Court. Left with no alternative, the Trial 
Court proceeded to close the evidence of the 
prosecution 
and 
after 
recording 
the 

SLP(CRL.) NO. 2520 OF 2017 
 
Page 6 of 11 
 
statement of the appellant under Section 
313 Cr.P.C., proceeded to hear the counsel 
for the parties and record the finding of 
acquittal. 
 
5. 
Learned Counsel for the appellant has drawn our 
attention to both the complaints, the judgement of 
acquittal as also the errors apparent on the face of 
record in the impugned order regarding both the 
grounds, that the complaint at Udaipur was prior 
in point of time than that at Hisar, and secondly 
that the Rajasthan Police had no knowledge of the 
proceedings at Hisar. 
 
6. 
Learned counsel for the respondents, both the State 
of Rajasthan as also the complainant, have 
vehemently argued that the Court at Hisar had no 
territorial jurisdiction as the offence had been 
committed at Udaipur, and therefore, the judgment 
of acquittal delivered by the Hisar Court was void. 
The complaint ought to have been examined and 
investigated by Rajasthan Police, but owing to the 
interim order passed by this Court the investigation 
has not proceeded as such the petition deserves to 
be dismissed. We have also been taken through the 

SLP(CRL.) NO. 2520 OF 2017 
 
Page 7 of 11 
 
relevant statutory provisions under the Cr.P.C. in 
particular Sections 300, 177, 461 and Article 22 of 
the Constitution of India by the counsel for the 
parties and further reliance has also been placed 
on the following judgements: 
(i). Prem Chand Singh vs. State of UP3  
(ii). T.T. Antony vs. State of Kerala & Ors.4   
(iii). Y. Abraham Ajith & Ors. vs. Inspector of 
Police, Chennai & Anr.5 
The first two have been relied upon by the 
counsel for the appellant and the third by the 
counsel for the respondents. 
7. 
Without going into these statutory provisions and 
the case laws relied upon by the parties, we are 
convinced that the impugned proceedings are 
nothing but an abuse of the process of law. It is not 
denied by the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 that they did 
not lodge complaint at Hisar. They also did not file 
an application withdrawing their complaint on the 
ground that it was wrongly filed here or that the 
said complaint may be transferred to Udaipur for 
investigation as the offence was committed at 
 
3 (2020) 3 SCC 54 
4  (2001) 6 SCC 181 
5 (2004) 8 SCC 100 

SLP(CRL.) NO. 2520 OF 2017

Udaipur. They allowed the investigating agency to 
continue to investigate in which their statements 
were also recorded. The respondent No.3 was a 
gazetted Police Officer at the relevant time and was 
also well aware of the laws, in particular the Cr.P.C. 
and the provisions thereto. Neither the complainant 
nor the victim entered the witness box before the 
Hisar Court allowing total wastage of the valuable 
time of the Court and the investigating agency. 
Merely because she was a Police Officer, she first 
managed to get an FIR lodged at Hisar through her 
father, and thereafter she moved to her hometown 
at Udaipur and got another complaint lodged by her 
father within a week.  
8. 
The following admitted dates would be relevant to 
upset the finding of the High Court that the 
complaint at Udaipur was prior in point of time: 
(i). 
Complaint at Hisar is dated 10.10.2015. 
(ii). 
Complaint at Udaipur is dated 15.10.2015. 
(iii). FIR registered at Hisar is dated 17.10.2015 
(iv). FIR 
registered 
at 
Udaipur 
is 
dated 
01.11.2015. 
On what basis the High Court recorded the finding 
that the complaint at Udaipur was prior in point of 

SLP(CRL.) NO. 2520 OF 2017 
 
Page 9 of 11 
 
time is not discernible from the above dates and is 
contrary to the records and the admitted facts. 
 
9. 
It is also not in dispute that in the complaint lodged 
at Udaipur, the allegations were the same as in the 
complaint at Hisar and additionally it was stated in 
the complaint at Udaipur that the complainant had 
earlier lodged a complaint at Hisar. Thus, the 
investigating agency at Udaipur was well aware of 
the complaint on similar allegations being lodged at 
Hisar. The High Court again fell in error in 
observing that the Rajasthan Police was not aware 
about the earlier proceedings initiated at Hisar. The 
High Court and the Rajasthan Police were expected 
to at least read the complaint carefully. 
 
10. Thus, on both the counts, we find that the High 
Court fell in error in dismissing the petition of the 
appellant. 
 
11. In the facts and circumstances as recorded above, 
we are of the view that respondent Nos. 2 and 3 had 
been misusing their official position by lodging 
complaints one after the other. Further, their 
conduct of neither appearing before the Trial Court 

SLP(CRL.) NO. 2520 OF 2017 
 
Page 10 of 11 
 
at Hisar nor withdrawing their complaint at Hisar, 
would show that their only intention was to harass 
the appellant by first making him face a trial at 
Hisar and then again at Udaipur. It would also be 
relevant to note that the appellant had been 
arrested and thereafter granted bail. And now 
before this Court, the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have 
been vehemently opposing the quashing of the FIR 
at Udaipur. We may also note that in the complaint 
made at Hisar, there are allegations to the effect 
that when respondent No.2 visited the appellant at 
Hisar, he had made a demand of Rs. 50,00,000/- 
and also an Innova Car. Thus, the argument that 
no offence was committed in Hisar but only at 
Udaipur was also not correct. We thus deprecate 
this practice of state machinery being misused for 
ulterior motives and for causing harassment to the 
other side, we are thus inclined to impose cost on 
the respondent No.2 in order to compensate the 
appellant. 
 
12. In view of the above, the appeal is allowed. The 
impugned order passed by the High Court is 
quashed, and the impugned proceedings registered 
as FIR No. 156 of 2015 dated 01.11.2015, Women 

SLP(CRL.) NO. 2520 OF 2017

Police Station, Udaipur are quashed with costs of 
Rs. 5,00,000/- (Rs. Five Lacs Only) which shall be 
deposited with the Registrar of this Court within 
four weeks and upon deposit of the same, 50% may 
be transmitted in the account of Supreme Court 
Legal Services Committee and the remaining 50% 
to the appellant.
