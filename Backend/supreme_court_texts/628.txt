moved by the appellant praying inter alia that directions be issued to the Liquidator, Sri 
Lakshmi Hotel Private Limited to stall all proceedings in respect of the e-auction conducted 
by him on 23rd December, 2019, to work on an alternative manner of dividing the property 
put to auction and sell only a part of the land and for grant of sufficient time to make 
payment to the financial creditor. (ii) Company Appeal No. 339 of 2021 (subject matter of 
Civil Appeal No. 9060 of 2022) arose from the common order dated 17th November, 2021 
passed by the Adjudicating Authority on an Interim Application5 seeking recall of its order 
dated 05th May, 2020 passed on an application6 filed by the appellant. (iii) Company Appeal 
No. 343 of 2021 (subject matter of Civil Appeal No. 9061 of 2022)  filed by the appellant 
on 27th October, 2021 under Section 61 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 20167 
against order dated 05th May, 2020 passed by the Adjudicating Authority allowing an 
application moved by the successful bidder, M/s KMC Speciality Hospitals (India) Limited8 
for extension of time to deposit the balance sale consideration after the Central/State 
lockdown was lifted. All the aforesaid appeals were dismissed by the Tribunal under the 
impugned judgment and order dated 16th September, 2022. 
2. 
 It may be noted at the outset that Civil Appeal No. 9059 of 2022 does not survive 
inasmuch as the auction proceedings have already been concluded and upon the Auction 
Purchaser depositing the sale amount, the Liquidator has executed a Sale Deed in its

favour. Therefore, the scope of the present judgment is confined to Civil Appeals No. 9060 
and 9061 of 2022. 
B. 
  SEQUENCE OF EVENTS  
3. 
The facts of the case lie in a narrow compass. Sri Lakshmi Hotels Private Limited9, 
a family held concern having four shareholders namely, the appellant herein, his wife, his 
son and his daughter-in-law purchased an immovable property10 at Tiruchirappalli 
measuring 67,533 sq. ft. The company started running a hotel and a bar from the said 
premises. In the year 2006, the company took a loan from a financial creditor to the tune 
of ₹1,57,25,000/- (Rupees One crore fifty seven lakh twenty five thousand only). When 
disputes arose between the company and the financial creditor, the latter invoked the 
arbitration clause governing the parties. The Arbitral Tribunal passed an award on 27th 
December, 2014, for a sum of ₹ 2,21,08,244/- (Rupees Two crore twenty one lakh eight 
thousand two hundred and forty four only) in favour of the financial creditor along with 
interest at the rate of 24 % per annum from the date of claim petition till the date of 
realisation. The company challenged the said award11 under Section 34 of the Arbitration 
and Conciliation Act, 1996, but the said petition was dismissed by the High Court of Madras 
vide order dated 16th November, 201711.  
4. 
On non-payment of the amounts awarded under the Arbitral Award, the financial 
creditor filed an application12 under Section 7 of the IBC before the Adjudicating Authority

for initiating corporate insolvency resolution process against the company. The said 
petition was admitted on 28th February, 2019 and the respondent No. 2 was appointed as 
an Interim Resolution Professional13. Later on, he was confirmed as a Resolution 
Professional and finally, as a Liquidator. As per the records, no resolution plan for revival 
of the Corporate Debtor was received and the Committee of Creditors14 recommended that 
the company be liquidated. The said recommendations were accepted by the Adjudicating 
Authority, vide order dated 17th July, 2019.   
5. 
 Pursuant to the above, the Liquidator engaged two Registered Valuers to give an 
estimate of the valuation of the subject property. The Valuers submitted their Reports as 
follows:  
S.No. 
Name of the Valuer 
Tax Value 
Liquidation Value

Rs.48,03,00,000

Rs.38,00,00,000 
 
Average Liquidation Value for the purpose

Rs.39,41,28,500 
 
Based on the above Reports, the Liquidator arrived at the average value of the subject 
property, i.e., ₹39,41,28,500/- (Rupees Thirty nine crore forty one lakh twenty eight 
thousand five hundred only) and scheduled an auction on 25th November, 2019, with a 
reserve price set at the above figure. Vide letter dated 08th November, 2019, the appellant 
objected to fixation of the reserve price. The Liquidator replied to the said communication 
and turned down his objections. He also requested the appellant to nominate a person in 
the Stakeholders Committee, which the appellant failed to do.

6. 
When the Liquidator did not receive any bid in the first auction, he published a notice 
scheduling a second auction on 23rd December, 2019. This time, the reserve price was 
reduced by 25% i.e. it came down from ₹ 39,41,28,500/- (Rupees Thirty nine crore forty 
one lakh twenty eight thousand five hundred only) to ₹ 29,55,96,375/- (Rupees Twenty 
nine crore, fifty five lakh ninety six thousand three hundred and seventy five only). M/s 
KMC Speciality Hospitals (India) Limited was the sole bidder in the second auction process 
and on depositing an earnest amount of ₹ 2,95,59,698/- (Rupees Two crore ninety five 
lakh fifty nine thousand six hundred and ninety eight only), it emerged as the successful 
bidder. 
7. 
 In terms of Rule 12 of Schedule-I under Regulation 33 of the Insolvency and 
Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 201615, the successful bidder 
was required to pay the balance sale consideration within 90 days from the date of 
demand. The Liquidator despatched a letter dated 24th December, 2019 to the Auction 
Purchaser demanding the balance sale amount. Though arguments were initially 
advanced on behalf of the appellant that the period of 90 days for paying the balance 
amount ought to be reckoned from 24th December, 2019 and not from 26th December, 
2019, the date on which the Auction Purchaser received the communication from the 
Liquidator, later on the said plea was not seriously pressed. If one takes the outer limit for 
calculating the period of 90 days for the Auction Purchaser to pay the balance sale 
consideration reckoned from 26th December, 2019, the date when the Auction Purchaser 
 
15 IBBI Regulations, 2016 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 6 of 57 
 
received the letter despatched by the Liquidator, the said period would have expired on 
25th March, 2020. It is not in dispute that the balance sale consideration was not paid by 
the Auction Purchaser within the period of 90 days. The said amount was paid only on 24th 
August, 2020.      
8. 
The appellant filed a Miscellaneous Application4 before the Adjudicating Authority 
for setting aside the auction proceedings. The said application was dismissed by the 
Adjudicating Authority, vide common order dated 17th November, 2021. In the meantime, 
due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Government of India imposed a countrywide 
lockdown on 25th March, 2020. On 22nd April, 2020, the Auction Purchaser moved an 
application6 before the Adjudicating Authority for extension of time for making payment of 
the balance sale consideration. Besides taking the plea of the onset of Covid 19 pandemic, 
one of the grounds taken by the Auction Purchaser for extension of time was that the 
Income Tax Authority had passed an order attaching the auctioned property. The said 
application was allowed by the Adjudicating Authority3, vide order dated 05th May, 2020 
and the time granted for depositing the balance sale consideration was deferred till the 
lockdown was lifted by the Central Government/State Government, respectively.  
9. 
 Dissatisfied with the aforesaid order, the appellant filed a Company Appeal16, after 
19 months, on 27th October, 2021. Well before that, the Auction Purchaser paid the balance 
sale consideration in respect of the auctioned property on 24th August, 2020 and a Sale 
Deed was executed by the Liquidator in favour of the Auction Purchaser on 28th August, 
 
16 Company Appeal (AT) (INS) No. 334 of 2021 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 7 of 57 
 
2020. One month after completion of the sale transaction, the appellant filed an application 
on 25th September, 20205, seeking recall of the order dated 05th May, 2020, passed by the 
Adjudicating Authority and challenging the execution of the Sale Deed.  By virtue of the 
common order dated 17th November, 2021, the Adjudicating Authority dismissed both the 
applications filed by the appellant, one for stalling the e-auction that was conducted on 23rd 
December, 20194  and the other for setting aside the Sale Deed dated 28th August, 2020. 
The said orders were carried in appeal by the appellant before the Tribunal. Vide common 
judgment and order dated 16th September, 2022, the Tribunal dismissed the appeals filed 
by the appellant, giving rise to the present appeals.  
C. 
   ARGUMENTS ADVANCED ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 
10. 
Mr. P. Chidambaram, learned Senior advocate appearing for the appellant 
submitted that the Tribunal failed to appreciate that the auction conducted by the Liquidator 
was in violation of the provisions of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 particularly, Regulation 31A 
that requires a Liquidator to constitute a Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee and 
Regulation 33 that prescribes the mode of sale of the assets of the Corporate Debtor 
through an auction in the manner specified in Schedule I. Relying on the decision in C.N. 
Paramasivam and Another v. Sunrise Plaza through Partner and Others17, it has been 
contended that Schedule I, Rule 12 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 is mandatory and any 
non-compliance thereof should result in cancellation of the sale. The decision in Sharif-
ud-din v. Abdul Gani Lone18 was cited by learned counsel to make a point that when the 
 
17 (2013) 9 SCC 460 
18 (1980) 1 SCC 403 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 8 of 57 
 
rule provides a consequence for failure to comply, then it ought to be treated as mandatory 
and not directory in character. It was argued that having regard to the mandatory character 
of the regulations, the Tribunal has erred in failing to appreciate that the Auction Purchaser 
could neither have sought extension of time to deposit the balance sale consideration nor 
could such an indulgence have been granted to it.  Dovetailed to the above, is the 
submission that the Liquidator was selective in applying the amended provisions of the 
IBBI Regulations, 2016, based on a Circular dated 26th August, 2019.   
11. 
The second submission made by learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant 
was that the Tribunal ought not to have concurred with the Adjudicating Authority to hold 
that the extension granted to the Auction Purchaser to deposit the balance sale 
consideration on account of the Covid-19 lockdown, was valid. It was submitted that since 
banks were functioning during that time, the Auction Purchaser had all the opportunity to 
deposit the balance sale consideration. Therefore, it had no defence for not making the 
payment on time. It was further submitted that the order passed by the this Court and relied 
on by the Auction Purchaser in GPR Power Solutions Pvt. Ltd. v. Supriyo Chaudhuri19, 
as also the order dated 02nd March, 2020 and the order dated 12th May, 2020 passed in 
Civil Appeal No. 1902 of 202020, could not have enured to its benefit for the reason that 
the said orders applied to filing of petitions, applications, suits, appeals or other 
proceedings within the prescribed period of limitation. Citing the decision in Sagufa 
Ahmed v. Upper Assam Polywood Products Pvt. Ltd.21 learned senior counsel 
 
19 (2021) 17 SCC 312 
20 Union Bank of India v. Rajat Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. and Others  
21 (2021) 2 SCC 317 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 9 of 57 
 
submitted that the order passed by this Court on 23rd March, 2020 in Suo Moto Writ Petition 
(Civil) No. 3/2020, was only intended for the benefit of vigilant litigants who were prevented 
from initiating proceedings within the period of limitation due to the pandemic and the 
lockdown. The Auction Purchaser was not a litigant before the Court and could not have 
availed of the said order. The Auction Purchaser was neither required to approach the 
Adjudicating Authority, nor to file any petition before the Tribunal for remitting the balance 
sale consideration.   
12. 
It was next canvassed on behalf of the appellant that the order of attachment by the 
Income Tax Authorities in respect of the auctioned property is an irrelevant consideration 
insofar as it relates to deposit of the balance sale consideration by the Auction Purchaser 
within 90 days. Alluding to the terms and conditions of the auction, learned counsel argued 
that the e-auction was conducted on an ‘As Is Where Is’ basis and clause 12 of the said 
Notice of auction clearly stated that the sale would be subject to the IBC and the IBBI 
Regulations, 2016. Therefore, the Auction Purchaser cannot be heard to state that it was 
unaware of the Income Tax attachment order. Having bid for the subject property and 
agreed to the condition that the balance sale amount had to be deposited within 90 days, 
the Auction Purchaser was under an obligation to comply with the terms of the auction and 
on failure to do so, the Liquidator ought to have cancelled the sale instead of 
accommodating the Auction Purchaser.   
13. 
Lastly, learned counsel submitted that even assuming that the last date for making 
the payment towards the balance sale consideration was 25th March, 2020, as was urged 
by the other side, the period of limitation would have recommenced on 23rd July, 2020, 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 10 of 57 
 
since the Liquidator had moved an application22 seeking exclusion of the period between 
23rd March, 2020 and 23rd July, 2020. In view of the above, there was no justification for 
the Auction Purchaser to have made the payment on 24th August, 2020 i.e. after a period 
of one month reckoned from the date when the exclusion period had ended.  
D.   ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL FOR THE 
AUCTION PURCHASER 
 
14. 
Rebutting the submissions made by learned counsel for the appellant, Mr. Arvind 
Datar, Senior Advocate appearing for the Auction Purchaser submitted that the time to 
complete all actions under the IBC stood extended from 15th March, 2020 onwards in view 
of the Covid-19 circulars and orders passed by this Court in the Suo Motu Writ Petition23 
initiated by this Court read in conjunction with Regulation 47A of IBBI Regulations, 2016.  
Therefore, there was no default on the part of the Auction Purchaser in making payment 
of the balance sale consideration at a later date.  Referring to the decision of this Court in 
GPR Power Solutions Private Limited (supra) learned senior counsel submitted that the 
extension orders were applied by this Court even to submissions of claims by creditors to 
the resolution professionals.  For this reason, it would be erroneous to state that extension 
could apply only to litigants before courts and Tribunals, as sought to be urged by the other 
side. The decisions in Standard Surfa Chem India Private Limited v. Kishore Gopal 
Somani24 and Prakash Chandra Kapoor v. Vijay Kumar Iyer25 were cited by learned 
 
22 lA No. 202 of 2021 in CP/1140/IB/20181. 
23 Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) No.3 of 2020 in ‘Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, In Re’, reported as (2020)

counsel to argue that timelines prescribed under the IBBI Regulations, 2016 are directory 
and not mandatory in character.  Learned counsel submitted that reliance placed by the 
appellant on C.N. Paramasivam (supra) to contend that the timeline of 90 days is absolute, 
is misplaced for the reason that the provisions governing the Debt Recovery Tribunal26 and 
the Adjudicating Authority are not pari materia.  Learned senior counsel submitted that 
unlike DRT’s, Adjudicating Authority has special inherent powers under Rule 11 of the 
National Company Law Tribunal Rules, 201627.   Furthermore, even in cases initiated under 
the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security 
Interest Act28, this Court had granted extension to an Auction Purchaser to deposit the 
balance sale consideration in view of the Covid-19 lockdown situation.  For this, learned 
senior counsel referred to the order dated 12th May, 202029 passed by this Court in Union 
Bank of India v. Rajat Infrastructure Private Limited and Others30.    Similarly, he 
submitted that the Sagufa Ahmed case (supra) referred to on behalf of the appellant, 
cannot apply to the facts of the instant case for the reason that in the captioned case, the 
timeline for filing an appeal before the Tribunal had expired before 15th March, 2020, which 
was not so here as the timeline for the Auction Purchaser to deposit the balance sale 
consideration had expired after declaration of the COVID-19 lockdown by the Government 
of India on 22nd March, 2020.

15. 
Learned senior counsel clarified that the Auction Purchaser had applied to the 
Liquidator on 28th February, 2020, for extension of time to deposit the balance sale 
consideration after the Income Tax attachment orders were lifted.  The Liquidator 
responded to the said communication only on 02nd April, 2020 stating that he did not have 
the powers to extend the time and for which, an application would have to be moved before 
the Adjudicating Authority after it resumed functioning partially.  For purposes of 
clarification, it may be noted that Adjudicating Authority had issued a notification that it 
would hear only urgent matters between 16th March, 2020 and 27th March, 2020.  On 22nd 
March, 2020, the Adjudicating Authority announced closure in the light of the lockdown 
and it was clarified that liquidation matters would not be considered as urgent.  The Auction 
Purchaser filed an application31 before the Adjudicating Authority seeking extension of 
time.  Vide order dated 5th May, 2020, the Adjudicating Authority allowed the said 
application and granted extension of time to the Auction Purchaser to deposit the balance 
sale consideration.  It is submitted that the appellant did not take any steps to prefer an 
appeal against the aforesaid order within the period prescribed in Section 61 of the IBC.  
Instead, after the entire sale transaction was completed, the appellant filed an application 
for review, which was dismissed by the Adjudicating Authority.  After waiting for 15 months, 
the appellant filed an appeal on 27th October, 2021.  Even at that stage, the appellant did 
not seek any interim orders before the Adjudicating Authority or the Tribunal.  As a result, 
the Auction Purchaser proceeded to construct a 200-bed Mother and child hospital at the 
 
31 IA No. 335/IB/2020 in MA No.689 of 2019 in CP No./1140/IB/CB/2018

Page 13 of 57 
 
auctioned property after demolishing the existing building on which a sum of 
₹1,70,00,000/- (Rupees One crore and seventy lakhs only) has been invested. The said 
hospital is now complete and fully functional and is stated to cater to the needs of seven 
surrounding districts in the area.    
16. 
Coming next to the submission made on behalf of the appellant that the order of 
attachment issued by the Income Tax authorities in respect of the auctioned property is 
not a relevant consideration when it came to depositing the balance sale consideration by 
the Auction Purchaser within 90 days, learned senior counsel for the Auction Purchaser 
sought to urge that sale of properties that are the subject matter of Income Tax attachment 
orders, must be treated on a different footing.  Such sale transactions cannot be completed 
because of the bar placed under the Income Tax Act, 196132.  A specific reference in this 
regard has been made to Sections 222 and 281 read with Rule 48 Part-III, Schedule 2 of 
the IT Act.   Several decisions of the Adjudicating Authority33 have been cited by the 
learned senior counsel to canvass that in such circumstances, the Liquidator has no option 
but to approach the Adjudicating Authority for appropriate directions.  Even in the present 
case, the Liquidator had to move an application before the Adjudicating Authority for 
appropriate directions.  The said application was allowed on 10th February, 2020.  
However, the order passed on 10th February, 2020 was received by the Liquidator only on

14th May, 2020.  Due to several hindrances on account of the COVID-19 situation, the 
actual attachment of the subject property was lifted only on 27th August, 2020.  Just a few 
days before that, the Auction Purchaser deposited the balance sale consideration on 24th 
August, 2020 and the sale transaction was finally completed on 28th August, 2020.    
17. 
Countering the submission made on behalf of the appellant that Clause 12 of 
Schedule I under Regulation 33 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 requires the successful 
bidder to pay the balance sale consideration within 90 days from the date of the demand 
which timeline could not be extended, learned senior counsel for the Auction Purchaser 
argued that the time limit fixed under Rule 12 of Schedule I has to be read in conjunction 
with Rule 13 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 and in cases of attachment, the full amount has 
to be paid simultaneously with the completion and execution of the Sale Deed.  In the 
present case, the said steps could be taken only after the attachment was lifted by the 
Income Tax authorities.   
18. 
Learned senior counsel relied on Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Limited 
and Another v. Union of India and Others34 and Prakash Chandra Kapoor and 
Another v. Vijay Kumar Iyer and Another35, to contend that the model timeline for the 
liquidation process contemplated under Regulation 47 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 for 
completing the liquidation process, are only directory in nature.   
19. 
Learned senior counsel for the Auction Purchaser concluded by highlighting the 
conduct of the appellant and stated that he had repeatedly failed to pay the monies due;

he attempted to stall the auction process; he refused to remove the bar operating from the 
subject premises and police assistance had to be taken to take over physical possession 
of the subject property.  Therefore, concurrent findings returned by the Adjudicating 
Authority and the Tribunal being well reasoned, do not deserve interference.   Lastly, 
learned counsel submitted that without prejudice to the above submission, in the event this 
Court is of the opinion that the provisions of Rule 12 of Schedule I of the IBBI Regulations, 
2016 are mandatory and the Adjudicating Authority was not empowered to extend the 
timelines for paying the balance sale consideration, then this Court may exercise its powers 
under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to do complete justice but the auction sale 
may not be set aside.

Mr. C.U. Singh, Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No.1 - 
Liquidator supported the arguments advanced by learned senior counsel for the Auction 
Purchaser.  He submitted that the appellant has made unfounded allegations regarding 
valuation of the subject property at ₹39,41,28,500/- (Rupees Thirty nine crore forty one 
lakh twenty eight thousand and five hundred only).  The said allegations were responded 
to by the Liquidator, vide letter dated 15th November, 2019 clearly stating inter alia that the 
reserve price was based on the average liquidation value arrived at by the registered 
Valuers.  Contradicting the claim of the appellant that the subject property ought to have 
been valued at ₹1,00,00,00,000/- (Rupees One hundred crore only), it was submitted that 
no bidder had stepped forward to participate in the auction even with the reserve price of 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 16 of 57 
 
₹39,41,00,000/- (Rupees Thirty nine crore and forty one lakh only).  Reference was made 
to Regulation 33 read with para 4A of the Schedule I to the IBBI Regulations, 2016 to state 
that the second auction was conducted on 23rd December, 2019 with a permissible 
reduction of 25% in the reserve price that was set at ₹29,95,96,375/-  (Rupees Twenty 
nine crore ninety five lakh ninety six thousand three hundred and seventy five only).  This 
fact was duly intimated to the appellant who too could have made efforts to get a better bid 
for the subject property, but he didn’t take any such step.    
21. 
Refuting the submission made by the other side that the auction was conducted by 
the Liquidator without constituting a Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee, learned 
counsel submitted that there was no such requirement at the relevant point in time, which 
position has been clarified in the Explanation appended to Section 31A, that was inserted 
in the Regulations, vide Notification dated 25th July, 2019.  In the present case, the 
liquidation process had commenced earlier to issuance of the said Notification.  Further, 
the Tribunal has clarified that the amendment to Rule 12 of Schedule I under Regulation 
33 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 made by virtue of the same Notification would apply to 
pending liquidation process36.  Learned senior counsel submitted that in any event, such 
an objection was taken by the appellant for the first time in the recall application filed by 
him on 25th September, 2020 by which date, the entire process of sale stood concluded.  
It was submitted that the appellant is estopped from taking such an objection for the reason

that despite repeated requests made to him by the Liquidator to nominate a person in the 
Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee, he had not done so.   
22. 
Learned senior counsel for the Liquidator submitted that the COVID-19 pandemic 
had caused an extraordinary disruption leading to a nationwide lockdown from 20th March, 
2020 onwards. The Auction Purchaser had moved an application for extension of time to 
deposit the balance sale consideration, which was duly allowed by the Adjudicating 
Authority, vide order dated 5th May, 2020, extending the time until the lifting of the lockdown 
by the Centre/State Government.  The balance sale consideration was deposited by the 
Auction Purchaser on 24th August, 2020.  On receiving the said amount, the Liquidator had 
settled the outstanding claim of the Income Tax Department on 27th August, 2020 
whereafter, the Income Tax attachment was lifted and the Liquidator executed and 
registered the Sale Deed in favour of the Auction Purchaser on 28th August, 2020.  It was 
pointed out that the appellant decided to challenge the order dated 5th May, 2020 passed 
by the Adjudicating Authority, 14 months after the Sale Deed was executed and registered 
in favour of the Auction Purchaser, which shows his non-seriousness.  Further, learned 
counsel cited the decision in Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Limited and 
Another v. Union of India and Others37, wherein it has been held that the timeline 
prescribed in Sections 7(5), 9(5) and 10 (4) of the IBC are directory and not mandatory in 
character.

23. 
Learned counsel for the Liquidator supported the submissions made on behalf of 
the Auction Purchaser on the aspect of extension of the period of limitation and submitted 
that the expressions “litigation” and “litigant” appearing in the Suo Moto Writ petition must 
be given the widest import so as to cover all proceedings, including liquidation 
proceedings.  In the absence of any explicit bar, the said order would also apply to the 
auction process conducted in liquidation proceedings carried out under the IBC more so, 
when the Liquidator has been held to be a quasi judicial authority by this Court in Swiss 
Ribbons (P) Ltd. and Another v. Union of India and Another38.  Reliance has also been 
placed on GPR Power Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (supra) to urge that exclusion of time on 
account of the COVID-19 pandemic was allowed even in cases where claims were to be 
filed before the resolution professionals.  
F. 
REJOINDER ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 
 
24. 
In his rejoinder arguments, learned counsel for the appellant sought to distinguish 
the judgments of this Court relied on by the other side including in the case of Yashowanta 
Narayan Dixit v. Orient Insurance Company Limited39 and the orders passed on 2nd 
March, 2020 and 12th May, 2020 in Civil Appeal No. 1902 of 2020.  Relying on the decision 
in Union Bank of India v. Rajat Infrastructure Private Limited and Others40,  learned 
counsel submitted that this Court had noted that under Rule 9 (4) of the Security Interest 
(Enforcement) Rules, 200241, the balance of the purchase price payable had to be paid in 
 
38 (2019) 4 SCC 17 
39 (2022) 15 SCC 569 
40 (2023) 10 SCC 232 
41 For short ‘SIE Rules, 2002’ 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 19 of 57 
 
the said case on or before the fifteenth day of the confirmation of sale and even if a liberal 
construction is given to the said sub-Rule, and the orders passed by the Court from time 
to time, the time to deposit the balance amount with interest could extend only upto 30th 
April, 2022 and no further extension of time could have been granted thereafter.  This Court 
has also observed that Article 142 of the Constitution of India cannot be used to depart 
from the substantive law.  It was submitted that even if the Auction Purchaser was 
permitted to take the benefit of the order dated 17th November, 2021 passed by the 
Adjudicating Authority, it could take the last date for deposit upto 23rd July, 2020 whereas, 
the Auction Purchaser did not deposit the balance sale consideration till 24th August, 2020.  
25. 
Coming next to the submission made by learned senior counsel for the respondents 
that model timelines for the liquidation process under Regulation 47 of the IBBI 
Regulations, 2016 are directory in character and not mandatory, learned senior counsel 
for the appellant submitted that the decisions cited by the respondents to substantiate the 
said submission, are distinguishable on facts.   It was contended that this Court has itself 
held in Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Limited (supra) that the timelines 
mentioned in Sections 7(5), 9(5) and 10(4) of the IBC are directory in nature because they 
do not provide for any consequence if the period so mentioned is exceeded.  However, the 
word used in Rule 12 of Schedule I under Regulation 33 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 is 
“shall”.   The second proviso under Rule 12 provides for a consequence that in the event 
the amount is not paid within 90 days, the sale shall be cancelled.  The decision in the 
case of Prakash Chandra Kapoor (supra) is also sought to be distinguished on the same 
grounds.   Learned senior counsel submitted that in all the Rules under Schedule I, except 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 20 of 57 
 
for Rule 11, the word “shall” has been used and it has been held in Vidarbha Industries 
Power Limited v. Axis Bank Limited42, that if one provision uses the word “may”, and 
another provision uses the word “shall”, then wherever the word “shall” has been used, will 
have to be treated as mandatory.  Applying the said principle to the instant case, it was 
mandatory for the Auction Purchaser to have deposited the balance sale consideration in 
respect of the auctioned property within 90 days and at the outer date, on or before 23rd of 
July, 2020 when the period of the lockdown had come to an end.   
26. 
As for the submission made by the Auction Purchaser that the Income Tax 
attachment was lifted only on 27th August, 2020 and therefore, there was no occasion for 
it to have paid the balance sale consideration before the attachment was lifted, learned 
senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the Adjudicating Authority had passed an 
order on 10th February, 2020, directing the Income Tax Department to lift the attachment 
and the said order having been pronounced in open court, ought to have been in the 
knowledge of the respondents who cannot take a plea that the said order was 
communicated to them much later and therefore, they were oblivious thereto.   It was 
further argued that the amount attached by the Income Tax Department was actually paid 
on 3rd August, 2020, from out of the earnest money deposited by the Auction Purchaser.   
While the Income Tax Department passed an order lifting the attachment in respect of the 
subject property only on 27th August, 2020, the Auction Purchaser did not wait until then 
to pay the balance amount.  The balance sale consideration was deposited by the Auction 
 
42 (2022) 8 SCC 352 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 21 of 57 
 
Purchaser through RTGS on 24th August, 2020, which was three days before the date the 
Income Tax Department passed the order on 27th August, 2020. That being the position, 
the balance amount could have easily been paid by the Auction Purchaser in a similar 
manner (through RTGS) on or before 25th March, 2020, on the expiry of the period of 90 
days, which it miserably failed to do.    
27. 
Refuting the plea taken by the Auction Purchaser that under Section 281 of the IT 
Act, a sale shall be treated as void against any claim by the Income Tax Department which 
was a reason offered by it not to have paid the balance amount, learned counsel for the 
appellant submitted that such a plea is baseless inasmuch as the Auction Purchaser could 
have paid the balance amount by obtaining prior permission from the assessing officer.  
The Income Tax attachment did not stand in the way of payment of the balance sale 
consideration.  A distinction was sought to be drawn between the expression ‘payment of 
sale consideration’ and ‘execution of sale deed’.  The attention of the Court was also drawn 
to the letter dated 9th December, 2019 issued by the Liquidator to the Auction Purchaser 
in response to its communication dated 9th December, 2019 well before the date of auction, 
seeking a clarification. The Liquidator had clearly stated that the subject property was 
being sold under the IBC and the Income Tax Department could not have a priority in claim.  
In any case, the income tax dues were limited to a sum of ₹2,44,00,000/- crores (Rupees 
Two crore and forty four lakhs only) and the said amount could have been deposited with 
the Income Tax Department from out of the sale proceeds.   It was on the basis of the 
aforesaid clarification furnished by the Liquidator that the Auction Purchaser had 
participated in the auction process and once having succeeded in the bid, it was under an 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 22 of 57 
 
obligation to deposit the balance sale consideration within 90 days from the date of the 
auction.   
28. 
Questioning the stand taken by the respondents that Regulation 31A that requires 
constitution of a Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee by the Liquidator to advise on 
matters specified in the said Regulation, including sale of assets under Regulation 32, 
manner of sale, reserved price, amount of earnest money deposit, etc., was amended 
w.e.f. 25th July, 2019 and the Explanation in Regulation 31A made the said Regulation 
prospective, learned senior counsel for the appellant argued that the Liquidator could not 
have had the foresight to know that such an Explanation would be appended to Regulation 
31A much later, vide Notification dated 28th April, 2022.  In other words, as the said 
Regulation stood in the year 2019, it was incumbent for the Liquidator to have constituted 
the Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee and the explanation now offered, is a sheer 
afterthought.   
29. 
Another argument advanced is that if it is assumed that the Auction Purchaser could 
take refuge of the order dated 23rd March, 2020 passed by this Court in the Suo Moto Writ 
Petition on account of the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic read with Regulation 
47A of the IBBI Regulations, 2016, in the light of the order dated 17th November, 2021 
passed by the Adjudicating Authority, the last date for making the deposit by the Auction 
Purchaser could be extended upto 23rd July, 2020 and not beyond that. 
30. 
Learned senior counsel concluded by vehemently contesting the submission made 
by the other side that the appellant’s conduct showed that he was obstructing the 
liquidation process.  He sought to distinguish the judgment in Bombay Mercantile 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 23 of 57 
 
Corporative Bank Limited v. U.P. Gun House and Others43 cited by the other side on 
facts and submitted that vide order dated 5th December, 2023, that this Court had passed 
in the present Appeals, the Auction Purchaser was restrained from creating any third-party 
rights.   It was argued that had the sale been cancelled under Rule 12, second proviso to 
Schedule I under Regulation 33 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 and the subject property put 
to auction once again, there was a strong possibility that the same would have fetched a 
much higher amount.  But due to the casual manner in which the respondents have 
conducted themselves, the appellant and the shareholders have lost the valuable property 
and suffered a huge loss.  Without prejudice to the submission made above, learned 
counsel submitted that should the Court be inclined to accept the pleas taken by the 
respondents in opposition to the appeals, then it would only be fair to direct the Auction 
Purchaser to compensate the appellant for the loss of the value of the property which was 
assessed by the registered Valuers in the year 2019, at ₹48,00,00,000/- (Rupees Forty 
eight crores only).   
G.  
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
31. 
This Court has given its thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by 
learned counsel for the parties, perused the records and the judgments cited on both sides. 
We shall now deal with the contentions raised by learned counsel for the appellant ad 
seriatim.

COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND ITS IMPACT ON LIMITATION 
32.1 The ball was set rolling on the Notice for sale of assets issued by the Liquidator for 
conducting the e-auction of the land and building owned by the Corporate Debtor that 
declared the reserve price of the subject property as ₹29,55,96,375/- (Rupees Twenty nine 
crore fifty five lakh ninety six thousand three hundred and seventy five only).   The intending 
bidders were required to deposit 10 per cent of the reserve price as earnest money amount 
which came to ₹ 2,95,59,638/- (Rupees Two crore ninety five lakh fifty nine thousand six 
hundred and thirty eight only). Some of the relevant terms and conditions of the e-auction 
are extracted below:  
“1. E-Auction will be conducted on "AS IS WHERE IS", "AS IS WHAT IS" and 
"WHATEVER THERE IS BASIS" through approved service provider M/S E-
Procurement Technologies Limited (Auction Tiger).    
2. The intending bidders, prior to submitting their bid, should make their 
independent inquiries and inspect the property at their own expenses and 
satisfy themselves. …. 
xxxx 
8.  The EMD of the Successful Bidder shall be retained towards part sale 
consideration and The EMD of unsuccessful bidders shall be refunded. The 
EMD shall not bear any interest. The Liquidator will issue a Letter of Intent 
(LOD) to the Succes Bidder and the Successful Bidder shall have to deposit 
the balance amount (Successful Bid Amount-Ex Amount) within 90 on 
issuance of the LOI by the Liquidator Provided that payments made after 
thirty days shall attract interest at the rate of 12%. Default in deposit of the 
balance amount by the successful bidder within the time limit as mentioned 
in the LOI would entail forfeiture of the 10% of the amount deposited (EMD) 
by the Successful Bidder. 
xxxxx 
10.  The Liquidator has the absolute right to accept or reject any or all offer(s) 
or adjourn/postpone/cancel the e-Auction or withdraw any property or 
portion thereof from the auction proceeding at any stage without assigning 
any reason thereof. 
xxxxx 
12.  The sale shall be subject to provisions of Insolvency and bankruptcy code 
2016 and regulations made thereunder. 
 
xxxxx" 
 
32.2 The e-auction of the subject property took place on 23rd December, 2019.  Going 
by the Notice for sale issued by the Liquidator, the period of 90 days available to the 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 25 of 57 
 
Auction Purchaser to deposit the balance sale consideration, if reckoned from 24th 
December, 2019, the date when the Liquidator informed that it was the successful bidder, 
would have expired on 23rd March, 2020.  However, the Letter of Intent44 issued by the 
Liquidator on 24th December, 2019, was received by the Auction Purchaser on 26th 
December, 2019. The period of 90 days reckoned from 26th December, 2019 would have 
expired on 25th March, 2020. Admittedly, the balance sale consideration was not paid by 
the Auction Purchaser within the aforesaid timeline. The said amount was deposited by 
the Auction Purchaser through RTGS only on 24th August, 2020.  
32.3 For explaining the delay in depositing the balance sale consideration, the Auction 
Purchaser has sought to take shelter of the order dated 23rd March, 2020, passed by this 
Court in the Suo Moto Writ Petition wherein it was directed as under:  
Order 
“1. This Court has taken suo motu cognizance of the situation arising out of 
the challenge faced by the country on account of Covm-19 virus and resultant 
difficulties that may be faced by litigants across the country in filing their 
petitions/applications/suits/appeals/all other proceedings within the period of 
limitation prescribed under the general law of limitation or under special laws 
(both Central and/or State).  
2. To obviate such difficulties and to ensure that lawyers/litigants do not have 
to come physically to file such proceedings in respective courts/tribunals d 
across the country including this Court, it is hereby ordered that a period of 
limitation in all such proceedings, irrespective of the limitation prescribed 
under the general law or special laws whether condonable or not shall stand 
extended w.e.f. 15-3-2020 till further order(s) to be passed by this Court in 
present proceedings.  
3. We are exercising this power under Article 142 read with Article 141 of the 
Constitution of India and declare that this order is a binding order within the 
meaning of Article 141 on all courts/tribunals and authorities.  
4. This order may be brought to the notice of all the High Courts for being 
communicated to all subordinate courts/tribunals within their respective 
jurisdiction….”

32.4 For the sake of completion, we may note that the aforesaid Suo Moto Writ Petition 
was disposed of vide order dated 08th March, 2021. The operative para of the said order 
is extracted below: 
“1. … We are of the opinion that the order dated 23-3-2020 has served its 
purpose and in view of the changing scenario relating to the pandemic, the 
extension of limitation should come to an end. 
2. We have considered the suggestions of the learned Attorney General for 
India regarding the future course of action. We deem it appropriate to issue 
the following directions: 
2.1. In computing the period of limitation for any suit, appeal, application or 
proceeding, the period from 15-3-2020 till 14-3-2021 shall stand excluded. 
Consequently, the balance period of limitation remaining as on 15-3-2020, 
if any, shall become available with effect from 15-3-2021. 
2.2. In cases where the limitation would have expired during the period 
between 15-3-2020 till 14-3-2021, notwithstanding the actual balance 
period of limitation remaining, all persons shall have a limitation period of 
90 days from 15-3-2021. In the event the actual balance period of limitation 
remaining, with effect from 15-3-2021, is greater than 90 days, that longer 
period shall apply. 
2.3. The period from 15-3-2020 till 14-3-2021 shall also stand excluded in 
computing the periods prescribed under Sections 23(4) and 29-A of the 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 12-A of the Commercial 
Courts Act, 2015 and provisos (b) and (c) of Section 138 of the Negotiable 
Instruments Act, 1881 and any other laws, which prescribe period(s) of 
limitation for instituting proceedings, outer limits (within which the court or 
tribunal can condone delay) and termination of proceedings. 
2.4. The Government of India shall amend the guidelines for containment 
zones, to state: 
‘Regulated movement will be allowed for medical emergencies, provision of 
essential goods and services, and other necessary functions, such as, time-
bound applications, including for legal purposes, and educational and job-
related requirements.’ 
3. The suo motu writ petition is disposed of accordingly.” 
 
32.5 The Auction Purchaser has also invoked Regulation 47A of the IBBI Regulations, 
2016, that was inserted on 20th April, 2020 and made effective from 17th April, 202045. 
Regulation 47A provides for exclusion of the period of lockdown and reads as under : 
“Exclusion of period of lockdown 
 
 47A. Subject to the provisions of the Code, the period of lockdown imposed 
by the Central Government in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak shall not be 
 
45 Vide Notification No. IBBI/2020- 21/GN/REG059 dated 20.04.2020 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 27 of 57 
 
counted for the purposes of computation of the time-line for any task that 
could not be completed due to such lockdown, in relation to any liquidation 
process.” 
 
32.6 It is evident from a perusal of Regulation 47A, that the benefit of the said regulation 
was made available not only for initiation of any litigation, but also for computation of the 
timeline for completing any task in connection with a liquidation process that could not be 
completed on account of declaration of the lockdown.   We are not inclined to accept the 
submission made on behalf of the appellant that the word ‘Litigants’ used in the order dated 
23rd March, 2020 passed in the Suo Moto Writ Petition ought to be given a narrow 
interpretation so as to exclude a party like the Auction Purchaser herein as stricto sensu, 
it was not a litigant who was required to file any petition/application/suit/appeal or other 
proceeding before any Court/Tribunal/Authority within the period of limitation prescribed 
under a general law of limitation or under the special laws. It must be emphasised that a 
judgment can neither be read like a Statute nor can the expressions used in a judgment 
be assigned a narrow meaning or curtailed. In the larger contextual background of the 
Covid-19 breakout, a liberal interpretation would have to be adopted and the Auction 
Purchaser would be entitled to the benefit of the order dated 23rd March, 2020 read with 
Regulation 47A of the IBBI Regulations, 2016. The appellant cannot be heard to state that 
when the entire country was engulfed by the Covid-19 pandemic and a countrywide 
lockdown was imposed on 25th March, 2020 that was extended from time to time, the 
Auction Purchaser ought to have deposited the balance sale consideration within the 
stipulated 90 days.  In such a situation, a lenient view would have to be taken by the Court. 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 28 of 57 
 
32.7 The factual matrix of the case also needs to be kept in mind.  The Covid-19 
pandemic had broken out in the month of March, 2020.  A curfew was clamped by the 
Central Government on 22nd March, 2020, restricting the movement of the public. The 
Adjudicating Authority had issued a notification that only urgent matters would be taken up 
between 16th March, 2020 and 27th March, 2020. Before completion of the aforesaid period, 
the Central Government had declared a nationwide lockdown for 21 days till 14th April, 
2020, which period was subsequently extended till 03rd May, 2020. In this backdrop, came 
the order of this Court on 23rd March, 2020 extending the period of limitation w.e.f. 15th 
March, 2020 till further orders, which order was extended from time to time. The Governing 
Board of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India also decided on 17th April, 2020 to 
amend the IBBI Regulations, 2016 due to nationwide lockdown and incorporated 
Regulation 47A.  
32.8 On 28th February, 2020, the Auction Purchaser approached the Liquidator for 
seeking extension of time to deposit the balance sale consideration. It was stated that the 
balance sale consideration would be paid on the date of registration of the subject property 
and a request was made not to levy any interest.  On 02nd April, 2020, the Liquidator 
informed the Auction Purchaser that he was not empowered to relax the timelines for 
depositing the balance sale consideration and it ought to approach the Adjudicating 
Authority for appropriate relief. In view of the aforesaid response received from the 
Liquidator, the Auction Purchaser filed an application before the Adjudicating Authority on 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 29 of 57 
 
22nd April 202046, seeking extension of the time for making payment of the balance sale 
consideration on various grounds that included a plea that there was an income tax 
attachment order in respect of the subject property and the Covid-19 pandemic had caused 
a lot of disruption. It was this application that was allowed by the Adjudicating Authority 
vide order dated 05th May, 2020 granting the Auction Purchaser time to pay the balance 
sale consideration until the Central Government/State Government lifted the lockdown. 
32.9 In GPR Power Solutions (supra), a case cited by learned counsel for the Auction 
Purchaser, the appellant therein was a creditor of the Corporate Debtor who filed a belated 
claim under Regulation 7of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 which was rejected by the 
Resolution Professional on the ground of delay. The said delay was neither condoned by 
the Adjudicating Authority nor by the Tribunal. Both the orders were overturned by this 
Court in the light of the orders passed in the Suo Moto Writ Petition. We decline to draw a 
distinction between the appellant in the captioned case and the Auction Purchaser herein 
on a plea that the Auction Purchaser was not required to file any petition/application/ 
suit/appeal or other proceeding that was circumscribed by period of limitation. The spirit of 
the order passed in the Suo Moto Writ Petition was to overcome the challenges thrown by 
the lockdown clamped down on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. In our opinion, such 
an order would also extend to any action required to be taken in respect of a liquidation 
process, as contemplated in Regulation 47A of the IBBI Regulations, 2016.

32.10 The decision in Sagufa Ahmed (supra) relied on by learned counsel for the 
appellant to urge that the Auction Purchaser cannot claim the benefit of the order passed 
by this Court on 23rd March, 2020, is distinguishable on facts. In the said case, the statutory 
period of 45 days available to the appellant therein to prefer an appeal against an order 
passed by the Adjudicating Authority had expired on 02nd February, 2020 and the additional 
period of 45 days that could have been condoned by the Tribunal by virtue of the proviso 
to Section 421(3) of the Companies Act, 2013 had expired on 18th March, 2020 whereas 
the appeal was actually preferred on 20th July, 2020. Noting that the lockdown was 
imposed on 24th March, 2020 and there was no impediment for the appellant in the 
aforesaid case to have filed the appeal before 18th March, 2020, this Court had refused to 
permit the party to take refuge of the order dated 23rd March, 2020, passed in the Suo 
Moto Writ Petition and had opined that the said order was intended to benefit those who 
were vigilant about their rights.  
32.11 The decision in Rajat Infrastructure Private Limited (supra) alluded to by learned 
senior counsel for the appellant is also based on its own peculiar facts where successive 
applications were moved by the applicant – Auction Purchaser therein for extension of time 
to pay the balance sale price of the subject property.  Despite a long rope given by the 
Court by granting enlargement of time, the applicant kept on dragging its feet and 
committing defaults. In view of the aforesaid conduct, the Court referred to sub-rule (4) and 
(6) of Rule 9 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 31 of 57 
 
of Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules 200247 that prescribes time of sale, issue of sale 
certificate and delivery of possession and observed that even if a liberal construction is 
given to the said sub–rules, in view of successive orders passed by the Court on 
applications moved by the applicant – Auction Purchasers, it was not permissible to extend 
the timeline under the substantive statutory provisions dealing with the subject. The facts 
of the present case being on a different footing, the appellant cannot take advantage of the 
aforesaid decision. 
32.12 In the present case, as noticed above, the period of 90 days for depositing the 
balance sale consideration had expired just after the crucial date, i.e., 23rd March, 2020. 
We do not find any merit in the submission made by the appellant that the Tribunal ought 
not to have accepted the view taken by the Adjudicating Authority that Covid-19 lockdown 
was a valid reason for extension of time to deposit the balance sale consideration. 
33. 
ALLEGATIONS REGARDING UNDER-VALUATION OF THE SUBJECT 
PROPERTY 
 
33.1 The contention of the learned senior counsel for the appellant is that the Liquidator 
ought not to have auctioned the subject property by fixing a reserve price below the 
valuation submitted by the Registered valuers. To consider the said submission, it is 
necessary to examine the scheme of the IBBI Regulation, 2016 that applies to the 
Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process. Chapter VI of the Regulations titled ‘Realisation 
of Assets’ includes a list of regulations relating to sale of assets (Regulation 32), sale of a 
Corporate debtor as a going concern (Regulation 32A), mode of sale (Regulation 33), 
 
47 SARFAESI Rules, 2002  

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 32 of 57 
 
preparation of an asset memorandum (Regulation 34), valuation of assets or businesses 
intended to be sold (Regulation 35), preparation of the Asset Sale Report (Regulation 36), 
realization of security interest by secured creditor (Regulation 37), assignment of not 
readily realizable assets (Regulation 37A), distribution of unsold assets (Regulation 38), 
recovery of monies due (Regulation 39) and realization of uncalled capital/unpaid capital 
contribution (Regulation 40).  It can be seen that all the aforesaid regulations that fall under 
Chapter VI, are primarily concerned with realization of assets and the Liquidator has been 
tasked with several duties related to the said realization.  
33.2 Regulation 33 stipulates that a Liquidator shall ordinarily sell the assets of the 
Corporate Debtor through an auction in the manner specified in Schedule I. Regulation 35 
permits the Liquidator to appoint two Registered valuers to determine the realizable value 
of the assets or businesses listed in Regulation 32. On the Registered Valuers conducting 
a physical verification of the assets of the Corporate Debtor and submitting the estimate of 
the realizable value of the asset/business, the average of the two estimates received are 
to be taken as the value of the asset/business. It was in the light of the said Regulations 
that the Liquidator herein had engaged two Registered Valuers to give an estimate of the 
valuation of the subject property and the average of the two estimates was fixed by him at 
₹39,41,28,500/- (Rupees Thirty nine crore forty one lakh twenty eight thousand five 
hundred only) for purposes of conducting the e-auction. 
33.3 The objection taken by the appellant to the Liquidator slashing the reserve price by 
25 per cent and bringing it down to ₹ 29,55,96,375/- (Rupees Twenty nine crore, fifty five 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 33 of 57 
 
lakhs ninety six thousand three hundred seventy five only), is answered in Rule 4A of 
Schedule I under Regulation 33 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016, that states as follows: 
“(4A) Where an auction fails at the reserve price, the liquidator may reduce the 
reserve price by up to twenty-five percent of such value to conduct subsequent 
auction.” 
 
33.4 Admittedly, in the first round of the Notice for sale through e-auction published by 
the Liquidator on 25th November, 2019, he did not receive any bid. As a result, the 
Liquidator reduced the reserve price of the subject property by 25 per cent to conduct a 
second auction on 23rd December, 2019 wherein the Auction Purchaser was declared as 
the successful bidder. In our view, the Liquidator cannot be faulted for having exercised 
the discretion vested in him under Rule 4A of Schedule I when the auction scheduled 
earlier, did not bear any positive result. In fact, Rule 4B empowers the Liquidator to reduce 
the reserve price fixed under Rule 4A for subsequent auctions with a rider that the price 
shall not be reduced to more than 10 per cent at a time. The said eventuality did not arise 
in the present case since the Auction Purchaser was declared as the successful bidder in 
the second round of auction.  
33.5 If the appellant was so confident that the subject property would have fetched a 
much higher price, nothing precluded him from identifying a bidder who was willing to offer 
a better price. In fact, such a suggestion was made by the Liquidator in his reply dated 15th 
November, 2019 to the objection taken by the appellant to the estimated value of the 
subject property in his letter dated 8th November, 2019. The Liquidator had stated that “If 
you are confident enough that the property may fetch for more than Rs. 100.00 Crores you 
are at liberty to bring the proposed buyers and ask them to participate in the bidding 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 34 of 57 
 
process.”  Again, the Liquidator wrote a letter dated 27th November, 2019 to the appellant 
suggesting that ask eligible parties willing to offer a better price to participate in the auction 
process.  The appellant did not follow up after that. 
33.6 Therefore, the appellant cannot be permitted to argue that since the tax value of 
the subject property was estimated by the Registered Valuers at above ₹ 48 crores, the 
Liquidator ought not to have fixed the reserve price at ₹39,41,28,500/- (Rupees Thirty nine 
crore forty one lakh twenty eight thousand five hundred only) for the simple reason that 
though the reports of the Registered Valuers mentioned the tax value of the subject 
property at a little above ₹ 48 crores, but the liquidation value in both the reports was much 
lower and the Liquidator arrived at the average of the two estimated liquidation values to 
fix the reserve price of the subject property.   
34. 
NON-CONSTITUTION OF A STAKEHOLDERS CONSULTATION COMMITTEE 
AND ITS EFFECT 
 
34.1 It has been argued that the Liquidator has violated Regulation 31A of the IBBI 
Regulations, 2016 that requires him to constitute a Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee. 
For purposes of ready-reference, Regulation 31A is reproduced below: 
“31A. Stakeholders’ consultation committee.  
(1) The liquidator shall constitute a consultation committee within sixty days 
from the liquidation commencement date, based on the list of stakeholders 
prepared under regulation 31, to advise him on matters relating to-  
(a) appointment of professionals and their remuneration under regulation 7;  
(b) sale under regulation 32, including manner of sale, pre-bid qualifications, 
reserve price, amount of earnest money deposit, and marketing strategy: 
Provided that the decision(s) taken by the liquidator prior to the constitution 
of consultation committee shall be placed before the consultation committee 
for information in its first meeting. 
xxxxx 
(5) Subject to the provisions of the Code and these regulations, 
representatives in the consultation committee shall have access to all 
relevant records and information as may be required to provide advice to 
the liquidator under sub-regulation (1). 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 35 of 57 
 
xxxxx 
(8) The liquidator shall place the recommendation of committee of creditors 
made under subregulation (1) of regulation 39C of the Insolvency and 
Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate 
Persons) Regulations, 2016, before the consultation committee for its 
information. 
(9) The consultation committee shall advise the liquidator, by a vote of not 
less than sixty-six percent of the representatives of the consultation 
committee, present and voting.  
(10) The advice of the consultation committee shall not be binding on the 
liquidator: Provided that where the liquidator takes a decision different from 
the advice given by the consultation committee, he shall record the reasons 
for the same in writing. 
     
34.2 Regulation 31A that was inserted on the amendment of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 
by virtue of the Notification48 dated 25th July, 2019, requires a Liquidator to constitute a 
Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee within a period of sixty days from the date of 
commencement of the liquidation process. The Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee is 
to be drawn from the list of stakeholders on a category-wise basis, as prescribed under 
Regulation 31. The purpose of constituting a Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee is to 
advice the Liquidator on matters relating to appointment of professionals and their 
renumeration as also in relation to sale of assets under Regulation 32. However, it was 
observed by this Court in R.K. Industries (Unit-II) LLP v. H.R. Commercials Private 
Limited and Others49, that the advice offered by the Stakeholders’ Consultation 
Committee is not binding on the Liquidator. The safeguard provided in the Regulation is 
that if the Liquidator arrives at a decision which is at variance with the advice given by the 
Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee, he must record in writing reasons for doing so and

mention it in the next progress report. We may usefully extract the following para of the 
captioned case:  
“55. On a conjoint reading of the aforesaid provisions of IBC and the 
Liquidation Regulations, it is evident that the liquidator is authorised to sell 
the immovable and movable property of the corporate debtor in liquidation 
through a public auction or a private contract, either collectively, or in a 
piecemeal manner. The underlying object of the statute is to protect and 
preserve the assets of the corporate debtor in liquidation and proceed to 
sell them at the best possible price. Towards this object, the provisions of 
IBC have empowered the liquidator to go in for a public auction or a private 
contract as a mode of sale. Besides reporting the progress made, the 
liquidator can also apply to the adjudicating authority (NCLT) for appropriate 
orders and directions considered necessary for liquidation of the corporate 
debtor. The liquidator is permitted to consult the stakeholders who are 
entitled to distribution of the sale proceeds. However, the proviso to Section 
35(2) IBC makes it clear that the opinion of the stakeholders would not be 
binding on the liquidator. Regulation 8 of the Liquidation Regulations refers 
to the consultative process with the stakeholders, as specified in Section 
35(2) IBC and states that they shall extend all necessary assistance and 
cooperation to the liquidator for completing the liquidation process. 
Regulation 31-A has introduced a stakeholders' Consultation Committee 
that may advise the liquidator regarding sale of the assets of the corporate 
debtor and must be furnished all relevant information to provide such 
advice. Though the advice offered is not binding on the liquidator, he must 
give reason in writing for acting against such advice.” 
 
34.3 By virtue of the Notification dated 28th April, 2022, an Explanation was appended at 
the foot of Regulation 31A which clarifies that the requirement of constituting a 
Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee shall apply only to those liquidation processes that 
were to commence on/after the date of commencement of the IBBI Regulation, 2016.  In 
the present case, the liquidation process in respect of the company had commenced on 
17th July, 2019 and therefore, the submission made by the appellant that the Liquidator 
has breached Regulation 31A of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 by not constituting a 
Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee, is devoid of merits.  Even otherwise, the appellant 
cannot have a grouse on this count because the record reveals that the Liquidator had 
sent a reply on 15th November, 2019 to a written objection taken by the appellant on the 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 37 of 57 
 
Valuation reports submitted by the Registered Valuers on 08th November, 2019, wherein, 
it was stated that neither he nor the other ex-Directors of the company had responded to 
the Liquidator’s suggestion for calling a meeting of the CoC. Despite this, neither the 
appellant nor the other ex-Directors of the company took any step to depute a person from 
amongst them to be a part of the Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee. In view of the 
aforesaid facts, the objection taken by the appellant that the Liquidator has breached 
Regulation 31A, does not hold any water.  Nor is the Court inclined to examine the 
submission made at the instance of the appellant that in the absence of any explanation 
appended to Regulation 31A as it stood before 25th July, 2019, it was incumbent for the 
Liquidator to have constituted a Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee in view of his own 
conduct noticed above.  Further, such an objection was taken for the first time at the stage 
the appellant filed a recall application before Adjudicating Authority on 25th September, 
2020 by which time the entire sale transaction was over. 
35. 
ALLEGATION OF VIOLTION OF REGULATION 33 OF THE IBBI 
REGULATIONS, 2016 AND ITS EFFECT   
 
35.1 The appellant has raised serious objections regarding violation of Regulation 33 of 
the IBBI Regulation, 2016 by the Liquidator. Regulation 33 that deals with the mode of sale 
of assets has already been extracted above. Schedule I under Regulation 33 lays down 
the manner in which the assets of the Corporate Debtor are to be sold by the Liquidator. 
Schedule I is sub-divided into two segments, the first part deals with sale of an asset 
through auction and the manner in which such a sale shall be conducted by the Liquidator 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 38 of 57 
 
and the second part deals with private sales. The relevant clauses of Schedule I for 
purposes of the present discussion are as follows: 
"SCHEDULE I 
MODE OF SALE 
(Under Regulation 33 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India 
(Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016) 
1. 
AUCTION 
(1) Where an asset is to be sold through auction, a liquidator shall do so the 
in the manner specified herein. 
xxxxx 
(3) The liquidator shall prepare terms and conditions of sale, including 
reserve price, earnest money deposit as well as pre-bid qualifications, if 
any. 
xxxxx 
(6) The liquidator shall provide all assistance necessary for the conduct of 
due diligence by interested buyers. 
xxxxx  
(12) On the close of the auction, the highest bidder shall be invited to 
provide balance sale consideration within ninety days of the date of 
such demand:  
Provided that payments made after thirty days shall attract interest at 
the rate of 12%. 
Provided further that the sale shall be cancelled if the payment is not 
received within ninety days.  
(13) On payment of the full amount, the sale shall stand completed, the 
liquidator shall execute certificate of sale or sale deed to transfer such 
assets and the assets shall be delivered to him in the manner specified 
in the terms of sale. 
(emphasis added) 
 
 
 
35.2 Originally, Rule 12 read as follows : 
“(12) On the close of the auction, the highest bidder shall be invited to 
provide balance sale consideration within fifteen days of the date when he 
is invited to provide the balance sale consideration.  On payment of the full 
amount, the sale shall stand completed, the liquidator shall execute 
certificate of sale or sale deed to transfer such assets and the assets shall 
be delivered to him in the manner specified in the terms of sale.” 
 
Vide notification dated 25th July, 201950, two Rules were carved out from Rule 12, i.e., Rule 
12 and Rule 13 that have been extracted above. 
 
50 Notification No.IBBI/2019-20/GN/REG.047 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 39 of 57 
 
35.3 It is the submission of learned senior counsel for the appellant that Rule 12, 
Schedule I as above, is mandatory and non-adherence to the timelines set down in the 
said rule would result in cancellation of the sale. It has been argued that the period of 90 
days available to the Auction Purchaser to provide the balance sale consideration had 
expired on 25th March, 2020. The first proviso to Rule 12 stipulates that if the payment is 
made after 30 days, then the successful bidder would have to pay interest on the amount 
payable at the rate of 12 per cent. The second proviso to Rule 12 stipulates the outer limit 
for payment and states that if the payment is not received within 90 days, then the sale 
shall stand cancelled.  
35.4 To test the argument advanced by learned counsel for the appellant that the word 
used in Rule 12 of Schedule I is “shall” and not “may” and therefore, the prescriptions laid 
down in Rule 12 ought to be treated as mandatory and not directory in character, we may 
usefully refer to the observations made in Sharif-ud-din (supra) where a distinction was 
drawn between a mandatory rule and a directory rule in the following words: 
“9. The difference between a mandatory rule and a directory rule is 
that while the former must be strictly observed, in the case of the latter 
substantial compliance may be sufficient to achieve the object 
regarding which the rule is enacted. Certain broad propositions which 
can be deduced from several decisions of courts regarding the rules of 
construction that should be followed in determining whether a provision of 
law is directory or mandatory may be summarised thus: The fact that the 
statute uses the word “shall” while laying down a duty is not 
conclusive on the question whether it is a mandatory or directory 
provision. In order to find out the true character of the legislation, the 
court has to ascertain the object which the provision of law in question 
has to subserve and its design and the context in which it is enacted. 
If the object of a law is to be defeated by non-compliance with it, it has to 
be regarded as mandatory. But when a provision of law relates to the 
performance of any public duty and the invalidation of any act done in 
disregard of that provision causes serious prejudice to those for whose 
benefit it is enacted and at the same time who have no control over the 
performance of the duty, such provision should be treated as a directory 
one. Where, however, a provision of law prescribes that a certain act has to 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 40 of 57 
 
be done in a particular manner by a person in order to acquire a right and it 
is coupled with another provision which confers an immunity on another 
when such act is not done in that manner, the former has to be regarded as 
a mandatory one. A procedural rule ordinarily should not be construed 
as mandatory if the defect in the act done in pursuance of it can be 
cured by permitting appropriate rectification to be carried out at a 
subsequent stage unless by according such permission to rectify the 
error later on, another rule would be contravened. Whenever a statute 
prescribes that a particular act is to be done in a particular manner 
and also lays down that failure to comply with the said requirement 
leads to a specific consequence, it would be difficult to hold that the 
requirement is not mandatory and the specified consequence should 
not follow.” 
(emphasis added) 
 
35.5 This Court was called upon to interpret the expression “may” used in Section 7(5)(a) 
of the IBC vis-a-via the expression “shall” deployed in Section 9(5)(a), in Vidarbha 
Industries Power Limited (supra), and it was held thus: 
“63. The meaning and intention of Section 7(5)(a) IBC is to be ascertained 
from the phraseology of the provision in the context of the nature and design 
of the IBC. This Court would have to consider the effect of the provision being 
construed as directory or discretionary. 
64. Ordinarily the word “may” is directory. The expression “may admit” 
confers discretion to admit. In contrast, the use of the word “shall” 
postulates a mandatory requirement. The use of the word “shall” raises 
a presumption that a provision is imperative. However, it is well settled 
that the prima facie presumption about the provision being imperative 
may be rebutted by other considerations such as the scope of the 
enactment and the consequences flowing from the construction. 
65. It is well settled that the first and foremost principle of interpretation of a 
statute is the rule of literal interpretation, as held by this Court in Lalita 
Kumari v. State of U.P. [(2014) 2 SCC 1, para 14 : (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 524] 
If Section 7(5)(a) IBC is construed literally the provision must be held to confer 
a discretion on the adjudicating authority (NCLT). 
xxxx 
74. Sub-section (5) of Section 9 IBC provides that the adjudicating authority 
(NCLT) shall, within 14 days of the receipt of an application of an operational 
creditor under sub-section (2) of Section 9, admit the application and 
communicate the decision to the operational creditor and the corporate 
debtor, provided, the conditions stipulated in clauses (a) to (e) of Section 
9(5)(i) IBC are satisfied. The adjudicating authority (NCLT) must reject the 
application of the operational creditor in the circumstances specified in 
clauses (a) to (e) of Section 9(5)(ii) IBC. 
75. Significantly, the legislature has in its wisdom used the word “may” 
in Section 7(5)(a) IBC in respect of an application for CIRP initiated by a 
financial creditor against a corporate debtor but has used the 
expression “shall” in the otherwise almost identical provision of 
Section 9(5) IBC relating to the initiation of CIRP by an operational 
creditor. 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 41 of 57 
 
76. The fact that the legislature used “may” in Section 7(5)(a) IBC but a 
different word, that is, “shall” in the otherwise almost identical 
provision of Section 9(5)(a) shows that “may” and “shall” in the two 
provisions are intended to convey a different meaning. It is apparent 
that the legislature intended Section 9(5)(a) IBC to be mandatory and 
Section 7(5)(a) IBC to be discretionary. An application of an operational 
creditor for initiation of CIRP under Section 9(2) IBC is mandatorily required 
to be admitted if the application is complete in all respects and in compliance 
of the requisites of the IBC and the rules and regulations thereunder, there is 
no payment of the unpaid operational debt, if notices for payment or the 
invoice have been delivered to the corporate debtor by the operational 
creditor and no notice of dispute has been received by the operational 
creditor. The IBC does not countenance dishonesty or deliberate failure to 
repay the dues of an operational creditor.” 
(emphasis added) 
 
35.6 In C.N. Paramasivan (supra), one of the questions that fell for consideration before 
this court was whether the phrase “as far as possible” used in Recovery of Debts due to 
Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 199351 that contemplates certain provisions of the 
Income Tax Act to apply with the modification to the amount due under the Debt Recovery 
Act instead of the Income Tax Act, referring the Rule 57 of the Income Tax Rules which 
mandates deposit of 25 per cent of the purchase amount of an immovable property by a 
purchaser and contemplates the consequence of resale in such a default of deposit, this 
Court held thus: 
“27. There is nothing in the provisions of Section 29 of the RDDB Act or the 
scheme of the Rules under the Income Tax Act to suggest that a discretion 
wider than what is explained above was meant to be conferred upon the 
Recovery Officer under Section 29 of the RDDB Act or Rule 57 of the 
Income Tax Rules which reads as under: 
“57.Deposit by purchaser and resale in default.—(1) On every 
sale of immovable property, the person declared to be the 
purchaser shall pay, immediately after such declaration, a 
deposit of twenty-five per cent on the amount of his purchase 
money, to the officer conducting the sale; and, in default of such 
deposit, the property shall forthwith be resold. 
(2) The full amount of purchase money payable shall be paid by 
the purchaser to the Tax Recovery Officer on or before the 
fifteenth day from the date of the sale of the property.” 
It is clear from a plain reading of the above that the provision 
is mandatory in character. The use of the word “shall” is 
 
51 In short Debt Recovery Act, 1993 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 42 of 57 
 
both textually and contextually indicative of the making of 
the deposit of the amount being a mandatory requirement. 
28. The provisions of Rules 57 and 58 of the Income Tax Rules have their 
equivalent in Order 21 Rules 84, 85 and 86 CPC which are pari materia in 
language, sweep and effect and have been held to be mandatory by this 
Court in Manilal Mohanlal Shah v. Sardar Sayed Ahmed Sayed 
Mahmad [AIR 1954 SC 349] in the following words: (AIR pp. 351-52, paras 
8-9 & 11) 
“8. The provision regarding the deposit of 25 per cent by the 
purchaser other than the decree-holder is mandatory as the 
language of the rule suggests. The full amount of the purchase 
money must be paid within fifteen days from the date of the 
sale but the decree-holder is entitled to the advantage of a set-
off. The provision for payment is, however, mandatory … (Rule 
85). If the payment is not made within the period of fifteen days, 
the court has the discretion to forfeit the deposit, and there the 
discretion ends but the obligation of the court to resell the 
property is imperative. A further consequence of non-payment 
is that the defaulting purchaser forfeits all claim to the property 
… (Rule 86). 
9. … These provisions leave no doubt that unless the 
deposit and the payment are made as required by the 
mandatory provisions of the Rules, there is no sale in the 
eye of the law in favour of the defaulting purchaser and no 
right to own and possess the property accrues to him. 
*** 
11. Having examined the language of the relevant Rules 
and the judicial decisions bearing upon the subject we are 
of the opinion that the provisions of the Rules requiring 
the deposit of 25% of the purchase money immediately on 
the person being declared as a purchaser and the payment 
of the balance within 15 days of the sale are mandatory 
and upon non-compliance with these provisions there is 
no sale at all. The Rules do not contemplate that there can be 
any sale in favour of a purchaser without depositing 25% of the 
purchase money in the first instance and the balance within 15 
days. When there is no sale within the contemplation of these 
Rules, there can be no question of material irregularity in the 
conduct of the sale. Non-payment of the price on the part of 
the defaulting purchaser renders the sale proceedings as 
a complete nullity. The very fact that the court is bound to 
resell the property in the event of a default shows that the 
previous proceedings for sale are completely wiped out as if 
they do not exist in the eye of the law. We hold, therefore, that 
in the circumstances of the present case there was no sale and 
the purchasers acquired no rights at all.” 
29. Relying on Manilal Mohanlal case [AIR 1954 SC 349] Rules 84, 85 and 
86 of Order 21 were also held to be mandatory in Sardara 
Singh v. Sardara Singh [(1990) 4 SCC 90]. Similarly in Balram v. Ilam 
Singh [(1996) 5 SCC 705] this Court reiterated the legal position in the 
following words: (SCC p. 711, para 7) 
“7. … it was clearly held [in Manilal Mohanlal [AIR 1954 SC 
349] ] that Rule 85 being mandatory, its non-compliance 
renders the sale proceedings a complete nullity requiring the 
executing court to proceed under Rule 86 and property has to 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 43 of 57 
 
be resold unless the judgment-debtor satisfies the decree by 
making the payment before the resale. The argument that the 
executing court has inherent power to extend time on the 
ground of its own mistake was also expressly rejected.” 
30. We may also refer to the decisions of this Court in Rao Mahmood 
Ahmad Khan v. Ranbir Singh [1995 Supp (4) SCC275],Gangabai 
Gopaldas  Mohata v. Fulchand [(1997) 10 SCC 387] , Himadri Coke & 
Petro Ltd. v. Soneko Developers (P) Ltd. [(2005) 12 SCC 364] 
and Shilpa Shares and Securities v. National Coop. Bank Ltd. [(2007) 
12 SCC 165] , wherein the same position has been taken. 
31. In the light of the above we see no reason to hold that Rules 57 and 
58 of the Income Tax Rules are anything but mandatory in nature, so 
that a breach of the requirements under those Rules will render the 
auction non est in the eye of the law.” 
(emphasis added) 
 
35.7 In State of Bihar v. Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti52, referring to Section 
34(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, this Court has held that the absence of 
any consequences for infraction of a procedural provision implies that such a provision 
ought to be interpreted to be directory and not mandatory.  Following are the observations 
made in the captioned decision : 
“19. It will thus be seen that Section 34(5) does not deal with the power of 
the Court to condone the non-compliance thereof. It is imperative to note 
that the provision is procedural, the object behind which is to dispose of 
applications under Section 34 expeditiously. One must remember the wise 
observation contained in Kailash [Kailash v. Nanhku, (2005) 4 SCC 480] , 
where the object of such a provision is only to expedite the hearing and not 
to scuttle the same. All rules of procedure are the handmaids of justice and 
if, in advancing the cause of justice, it is made clear that such provision 
should be construed as directory, then so be it. 
 
 
xxxx 
21. Section 80, though a procedural provision, has been held to be 
mandatory as it is conceived in public interest, the public purpose 
underlying it being the advancement of justice by giving the 
Government the opportunity to scrutinise and take immediate action 
to settle a just claim without driving the person who has issued a 
notice having to institute a suit involving considerable expenditure 
and delay. This is to be contrasted with Section 34(5), also a 
procedural provision, the infraction of which leads to no 
consequence. To construe such a provision as being mandatory 
would defeat the advancement of justice as it would provide the 
consequence of dismissing an application filed without adhering to 
the requirements of Section 34(5), thereby scuttling the process of 
justice by burying the element of fairness.”

35.8 It can be discerned from the aforesaid discussion that when the law prescribes that 
a certain act has to be done in a particular manner for a party to acquire a right, then it 
ought to be treated as mandatory in character more so, when the Statute prescribes a 
consequence for failure to comply with the requirements laid down.  
35.9 The words “may” and “shall” used in different provisions of Schedule I of the IBBI 
Regulations, 2016 go to show that the legislature intended to ascribe different meanings 
to the said words depending on the steps required to be taken by the Liquidator for the 
sale of the assets of a Corporate Debtor. A perusal of the Rules under Schedule I 
demonstrate that a play in the joints has been given to the Liquidator only in particular 
circumstances relating to the sale of an asset through auction. Wherever the underlying 
intention is to maximize realization from the sale of assets, discretion has been vested in 
the Liquidator to sell the asset through auction in the best interest of the creditors, but not 
otherwise. For the rest of the steps towards sale of an asset, the mandate of the Statute is 
in the affirmative. In other words, a particular step if prescribed, is necessarily required to 
be taken by the Liquidator in the manner prescribed in the Rules under Schedule I.  He is 
not left with any discretion to condone the delay.  
35.10  When broken down, Rule 12 states that (a) the highest bidder in an auction shall 
be called upon to provide the balance sale consideration within 90 days from the date of 
such a demand; (b) any payments made after 30 days from such a demand shall attract 
interest at the rate of 12 per cent; (c) if the payment is not received within the period of 90 
days, the sale shall be cancelled. The word ‘shall’ has been used thrice in Rule 12. Coming 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 45 of 57 
 
next to Rule 13, the same states that (a) the sale shall stand completed on the payment of 
the full amount; (b) the Liquidator shall execute a sale certificate/sale deed to transfer such 
an asset(s); (c) the asset(s) shall be delivered in the manner prescribed in terms of the 
sale. The word “shall” has again been used thrice in Rule 13.  It is noticed that except for 
Rules 4A, 4B, 8 and Rule 11A where the word “may” has been used and it vests a 
discretion in the Liquidator to reduce the reserve price more than once and conduct 
multiple rounds of auctions with the purpose of maximizing realization from the sale of 
assets in the best interest of the creditors, in the remaining Rules, the word “shall” features 
prominently and without an exception.  But that is not to say that wherever the word “shall” 
has been used in the Rules under Schedule I, it attains a mandatory nature.  The Rule 
could still be construed as purely procedural if its infraction does not entail any serious or 
prejudicial consequence.  Much will depend on the connotation and the textual context of 
the Rule. 
35.11 In view of the analysis undertaken above, Rule 12 would have to be treated as 
mandatory in character for the reason that it contemplates a consequence in the event of 
non-payment of the balance sale consideration by the highest bidder within the stipulated 
timeline of 90 days, which is cancellation of the sale by the Liquidator. To that extent, there 
is substance in the submission made on behalf of the appellant that since the second 
proviso under Rule 12 contemplates a consequence of cancellation of the auction on non-
payment of the balance sale consideration within 90 days, the Liquidator was not 
empowered to extend the timeline. 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 46 of 57 
 
35.12 Reliance placed by learned counsel for the Liquidator on the decision in Pioneer 
Urban Land and Infrastructure Limited and Another v. Union of India and Others53 to 
contend that the timeline prescribed under Schedule 1 of the IBBI Regulations 2016 are 
directory and not mandatory in character, is misplaced.  The said decision holds that 
timelines available to operational creditors under the IBC are directory and not mandatory 
because no consequence is provided if the period is not extended or after the extension 
expires and it is in this context that the following observations have been made: 
“58. This Court, while dealing with timelines provided qua operational 
creditors, in Surendra Trading Co. [Surendra Trading Co. v. Juggilal 
Kamlapat Jute Mills Co. Ltd., (2017) 16 SCC 143 : (2018) 2 SCC (Civ) 
730] , held that the timelines contained in the provisos to Sections 7(5), 9(5) 
and 10(4) of the Code are all directory and not mandatory. This is for the 
obvious reason that no consequence is provided if the periods so mentioned 
are exceeded. Though this decision is not in the context of the 14-day period 
provided by Section 7(4), we are of the view that this judgment would apply 
squarely on all fours so that the period of 14 days given to NCLT for decision 
under Section 7(4) would be directory. We are conscious of the fact that 
under Section 64(1) of the Code, NCLT President or the Chairperson 
of Nclat may, after taking into account reasons by NCLT or Nclat for 
exceeding the period mentioned by statute, extend the period of 14 days by 
a period not exceeding 10 days. We may note that even this provision is 
directory, in that no consequence is provided either if the period is not 
extended, or after the extension expires. This is also for the good reason 
that an act of the court cannot harm the litigant before it. Unfortunately, both 
NCLT and Nclat do not have sufficient members to deal with the flood of 
applications and appeals that is before them. The time taken in the queue 
by applicants who knock at their doors cannot, for no fault of theirs, be put 
against them.” 
 
35.13 Nor can the decisions of the Tribunal in Standard Surfa Chem India Private 
Limited (supra) and Prakash Chandra Kapoor (supra) referred to by learned senior 
counsel for the Liquidator, be read in favour of the respondents. A sweeping observation 
that all the timelines prescribed in Regulation 47 are directory, is impermissible. The 
consequences of non-compliance of the specific rule would have to be individually 
 
53 (2019) 8 SCC 416 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 47 of 57 
 
examined to decide as to whether the said rule has a directory flavour or is mandatory in 
character.  
35.14 In the present case, records reveal that when the Auction Purchaser had 
approached the Liquidator seeking extension of time to deposit the balance sale 
consideration.  The Liquidator had rightly expressed his inability to do so and indicated that 
such a power vests only in the Adjudicating Authority. On receiving the aforesaid response, 
the Auction Purchaser did take steps to move the Adjudicating Authority for seeking 
extension of time for making the payments. It is a matter of record that the said application 
was allowed by the Adjudicating Authority on 5th May, 2020 and time was granted to the 
Auction Purchaser to pay the balance sale consideration on the Central Government/State 
Government lifting the lockdown.  The aforesaid order dated 5th May, 2020, was passed 
by the Adjudicating Authority in exercise of its inherent powers under Rule 11 of the NCLT 
Rules, 2016 which states as follows :   
"Rule 11 of NCLT Rules, 2016  
Inherent Powers - Nothing in these rules shall be deemed to limit or 
otherwise affect the inherent powers of the Tribunal to make such orders as 
may be necessary for meeting the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the 
process of the Tribunal.” 
 
35.15 The aforesaid Rule is not to be read in isolation but in conjunction with Section 35 
of the IBC that deals with the powers and duties of the Liquidator and states that the 
Liquidator shall have the powers and duties specified in clauses (a) to (o) of sub-section 1 
including the power to sell an immovable/movable property of the Corporate Debtor in 
liquation by public auction/private sale as per clause (f), subject to the directions of the 
NCLT.  Pertinently, it has been observed in Arun Kumar Jagatramka v. Jindal Steel and 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 48 of 57 
 
Power Limited54 that “the Liquidator exercises several functions which are quasi-judicial 
in nature and character. Section 35(1) itself enunciated that the powers and duties which 
are entrusted to the Liquidator are “subject to the directions of the Adjudicating Authority”. 
The Liquidator, in other words, exercises functions which have been made amenable to 
the jurisdiction of NCLT, acting as the Adjudicating Authority…..”.  
35.16 In the facts of the present case, the Adjudicating Authority exercised statutory 
powers under Section 35 of the IBC read with its inherent powers under Rule 11 of the 
NCLT Rules, 2016 for extending the time to deposit the balance sale consideration on 
sufficient cause being shown, i.e., in view of the countrywide lockdown due to the Covid-
19 pandemic. This latitude that was given in the aforesaid extraordinary circumstances to 
meet the ends of justice, cannot be faulted. 
36. 
IMPACT OF THE ATTACHMENT ORDER BY THE INCOME TAX AUTHORITIES 
ON THE SALE OF THE AUCTIONED PROPERTY  
 
36.1 All things even, having held that there was sufficient reason to grant extension of 
time to the Auction Purchaser to deposit the balance sale consideration in terms of orders 
passed by this Court in the Suo Moto Writ Petition read with the provisions of Regulation 
47A of the IBBI Regulations, 2016, and having regard to the view expressed above that 
the Adjudicating Authority was empowered in law to extend the time on sufficient cause 
being shown, the matter ought to have rested there.  But there is something more to be 
said in this case that revolves around the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the 
 
54 (Refer Para 81) (2021) 7 SCC 474  

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 49 of 57 
 
appellant regarding the import of the order of attachment issued by the Income Tax 
Authorities in respect of the auctioned property and its effect.   
36.2 It has been strenuously argued by learned senior counsel for the appellant that the 
attachment order could not be used as an excuse by the Auction Purchaser for belatedly  
depositing the balance sale consideration.   The terms and conditions of the Notice of Sale 
as extracted in this judgement go to show that the Liquidator had declared that e-auction 
of the subject property was being conducted on an "AS IS WHERE IS", "AS IS WHAT IS" 
and "WHATEVER THERE IS” basis. It was further clarified that the intending bidders must 
undertake their own independent inquiries, inspect the subject property and satisfy 
themselves before submitting their bids. 
36.3 The fact that the Auction Purchaser was aware of the income tax attachment order 
in respect of the subject property is borne out from the correspondence exchanged by it 
with the Liquidator, that forms a part of the records.   On certain queries being raised by 
the Auction Purchaser, the Liquidator had replied, vide letter dated 9th December, 2019 
and stated that : 
“if the property is sold under IBC, income tax will not have any priority claim 
and the property can be registered with NCLT order, apart from this the 
Income tax dues are very less hence it can also be paid out of the proceeds 
and no objection can be taken.”  
 
In a subsequent letter dated 17th December, 2019 addressed by the Auction Purchaser to 
the Liquidator, which was well before the date the auction was scheduled, among other 
issues raised, one of the requests made to the Liquidator was to ensure that the income 
tax attachment/prohibitory order on the subject property is lifted by the Income Tax 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 50 of 57 
 
Department. In his reply dated 19th December, 2019 to the aforesaid letter, the Liquidator 
had informed the Auction Purchaser that: 
“ 3. As regards to the Income Tax attachment/prohibitory order passed. I 
would like to clarify that Income tax already filed claim before me and shall 
be paid in order of priority as provided under Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code 
2016 and the registration of property on successful bidding has no 
relevance to the same. In case of any objection from the SRO the same 
shall be brought before the Tribunal and suitable order shall be obtained by 
the Liquidator so as to proceed with the registration.” 
 
36.4 It can be seen from the two clarifications given by the Liquidator to the Auction 
Purchaser that registration of the subject property in favour of the successful bidder was 
not to be linked with the income tax attachment order for the reason that the Income Tax 
Department had already lodged a claim before the Liquidator and payment was to be 
released to the Department in the order of priority, as stipulated under the IBC. Despite 
that, the Auction Purchaser did not proceed further.  
36.5 In the light of the Notice for sale and the replies furnished to the Auction Purchaser 
well before the bidding process had commenced, we are of the considered view that it was 
for the Auction Purchaser as an intending bidder to have conducted a due diligence at its 
own end, gather all the relevant information pertaining to the subject property which 
included the status of the property and the liabilities attached to it, weigh all the pros and 
cons and only thereafter participate in the auction process.   After having participated in 
the e-auction with its eyes wide open, the Auction Purchaser cannot be heard to state that 
payment of the balance sale consideration was linked with the lifting of the attachment 
order passed by the Income Tax Department when it knew all along that the auction was 
being conducted on an "AS IS WHERE IS", "AS IS WHAT IS" and "WHATEVER THERE 
IS” basis.  

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 51 of 57 
 
36.6 To fortify the submission that the sale transaction could not have been completed 
on account of the embargo placed under the IT Act, learned counsel for the Auction 
Purchaser has referred to Sections 222 and 281 of the IT Act read with Rule 48 Part III, 
Schedule 2 of the IT Act.  Section 222 of the IT Act, empowers the Tax Recovery Officer 
to draw up a statement specifying the amount of arrears due from an assessee who has 
defaulted in payment of tax and thereafter proceed to recover the said arrears by attaching 
and selling the assessee’s movable/immovable properties. Section 281 of the IT Act 
declares that if an assessee creates a charge or parts with the possession of any of his 
assets, such charge/transfer would be treated as void against a claim in respect of tax 
payable by the assessee. However, the second proviso to Section 281 clarifies that such 
a charge/transfer will not be void if it is made with the previous permission of the assessing 
officer. As for Rule 48 falling under Part III Schedule 2 of the IT Act, it contemplates 
attachment of an immovable property of the defaulter, prohibiting the defaulter from 
transferring/charging the property and prohibiting all other persons from taking benefit from 
such a transfer/charge.  
36.7 The sequence of the events as unravelled from the records reveal that the Income 
Tax Department had already filed a claim before the Liquidator who had in turn moved the 
Adjudicating Authority for appropriate directions relating to the subject property that was 
under the attachment order passed by the Income Tax Authorities. The said application 
was disposed of by the Adjudicating Authority vide order dated 10th February, 2020 
wherein, directions were issued to lift the attachment order subject to the conditions that 
may be specified in an Escrow account where the sale consideration would be deposited 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 52 of 57 
 
by the Liquidator. The said order passed in open Court was duly conveyed by the 
Liquidator to the Auction Purchaser, though it is the stand of the latter that a physical copy 
of the said order passed on 10th February, 2020, was received by it much later, in the 
month of May, 2020. The escrow account55 was created on 3rd August, 2020 and the entire 
tax arrears amounting to ₹2,44,01,603/- (Rupees Two crore forty four lakhs one thousand 
six hundred and three only) were deposited in the escrow account on 24th August, 2020, 
though the income tax department lifted the attachment order three days later, on 27th 
August, 2020.  This was duly conveyed to the office of the Sub-Registrar at Trichy on the 
same date.  The second proviso to Section 281 of the IT Act did provide a window to the 
Auction Purchaser to approach the assessing officer for prior permission to transfer the 
subject property. But that option was exercised when the Liquidator moved an application 
for appropriate permission before the Adjudicating Authority which was granted on 10th 
February, 2020 under intimation to the Auction Purchaser.  
36.8 The contention of the learned counsel for the Auction Purchaser is that Rule 13, 
Schedule I of the IBBI Regulation, 2016 must be read in conjunction with Rule 12 and only 
on payment of the full amount, could the sale transaction be treated to have been 
completed in all respects. Since the full amount could not be paid till the attachment order 
was lifted, the Liquidator could not have executed a certificate for sale/sale deed to transfer 
the subject property in favour of the Auction Purchaser.

CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 53 of 57 
 
36.9 We are afraid, such an assumption does not stand to reason. Rule 12 is not 
interlinked with Rule 13. Both the Rules cover different situations.  The first proviso to Rule 
12 gives a leeway to the successful bidder to make payment of the balance sale 
consideration after thirty days subject to paying interest at the rate of 12%. However, the 
second proviso to Rule 12 is unequivocal and declares that the sale itself will be treated 
as cancelled if the payment is not received within the outer limit of 90 days. It is only on 
completion of the steps contemplated in Rule12 that Rule 13 can come in.  Reference to 
Rule 13 that starts with the expression “on payment of the full amount” would naturally be 
understood to mean on payment of the full amount within the period prescribed in Rule 12.   
We have already held Rule 12 to be mandatory in character because non-payment within 
the timeline has consequences attached to it.  However, in contrast thereto, there are no 
adverse consequences spelt out in Rule 13 for it to be treated as mandatory.   The said 
Rule lays down the procedure for completion of the sale and would have to be treated as 
directory since some procedural steps have been set out for purposes of completion of the 
sale process, but nothing beyond that.   We are therefore not inclined to accept the 
submissions made by the respondents that none of the activities as contemplated in Rule 
12 could have been completed unless and until the attachment order passed by the Income 
Tax Authorities was lifted or that the Liquidator was not in a position to complete the sale 
under Rule13 on that count. 
36.10 In any event, the Liquidator had taken timely steps to move the Adjudicating 
Authority for appropriate permission which was obtained as long back as on 10th February, 
2020, i.e. about a month and a half before the nationwide lockdown was declared.  

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 54 of 57 
 
Moreover, the Auction Purchaser was well aware of the fact that the entire tax arrears 
amounted to ₹2,44,01,603/- (Rupees Two crore forty four lakh one thousand six hundred 
and three only), which could have easily been paid out of the earnest money of 
₹2,95,59,638/- (Rupees Two crore ninety five lakh fifty nine thousand six hundred and 
thirty eight only) deposited by it, still leaving some surplus funds.   The Liquidator had also 
taken steps to apprise the Auction Purchaser of the said position and the order of priority 
that was to be given to the claim of the Income Tax Department.  Yet the Auction Purchaser 
did not deposit the balance sale consideration.  In view of the above, the plea taken by the 
Auction Purchaser that the income tax attachment order was a serious and an 
insurmountable impediment in completion of the sale and the subject property could not 
have been validly transferred in its favour by the Liquidator, is rather tenuous and not 
persuasive.   
36.11 The anxiety of the Auction Purchaser was adequately addressed on the 
Adjudicating Authority passing an order on 10th February, 2020, lifting the attachment 
order.  This order was communicated by the Liquidator to the Auction Purchaser well in 
time.  Mere not receipt of a copy of the said order cannot be a ground for the Auction 
Purchaser to have delayed deposit of the entire balance sale consideration.   The spectre 
of Covid-19 was nowhere on the horizon at that time. It spiralled only in the last week of 
March, 2020.  If the Auction Purchaser was serious, it could have easily deposited at least 
some amount out of the balance sale consideration of ₹26,60,36,677/- (Rupees Twenty 
six crore sixty lakh thirty six thousand six hundred and seventy seven only) much earlier, 
but it elected not to deposit a penny till the end of August, 2020.   When the first proviso to 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 55 of 57 
 
Rule 12, Schedule I of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 permits payment of sale consideration 
after expiry of 30 days from the date of demand subject to payment of interest @ 12% p.a., 
there was no question of the Auction Purchaser going scot free, when its conduct has not 
been blemishless.   
36.12 On an overall conspectus of the facts of the present case which brings out the 
glaring default on the part of the Auction Purchaser in making deposit of the balance sale 
consideration even after permission was granted by the Adjudicating Authority on 10th 
February, 2020 to lift the attachment order, the only  question that needs to be answered 
is as to whether this Court should proceed to set aside the auction and as a sequence 
thereto, declare as null and void, the sale certificate issued by the Liquidator in favour of 
the Auction Purchaser, as has been pleaded by the appellant. 
36.13 In our opinion, such an order would be too harsh.    Much water has flown under 
the bridge by now.  The subject land has been utilized by the Auction Purchaser to build a 
200-bed Mother and Child hospital which is operational.  Huge amounts have been 
pumped into the project by the Auction Purchaser.  The hospital is fully functional providing 
medical facilities to seven surrounding districts.    In contrast, the appellant has not been 
a vigilant litigant.  His conduct shows that he has dragged his feet at every stage. Records 
reveal that belated applications have been filed by him for seeking recall of the orders 
passed by the Adjudicating Authority granting extension of time to the Auction Purchaser.  
For reasons best known to him, it took 19 months for the appellant to prefer an appeal 
before the Tribunal against the order passed by the Adjudicating Authority, as provided for 

 
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 9059-9061 OF 2022 
 
Page 56 of 57 
 
in the IBC. Furthermore, the appellant resisted handing over possession of the subject 
property to the respondents thereby causing more delay. 
36.14 This Court must underscore the well settled legal position that once an auction is 
confirmed, it ought to be interfered with on fairly limited grounds. (Refer: Valji Khimji and 
Co. v. Hindustan Nitro Product (Gujarat) Ltd. (Official Liquidator)56 and Celir LLP v. 
Bafna Motors (Mumbai) Private Limited and others57). Repeated interferences in public 
auction also results in causing uncertainty and frustrates the very purpose of holding 
auctions. (Refer : K. Kumara Gupta v. Sri Markendaya and Sri Omkareswara Swamy 
Temple and others58).    Unless there are some serious flaws in the conduct of the auction 
as for example perpetration of a fraud/collusion, grave irregularities that go to the root of 
such an auction, courts must ordinarily refrain from setting them aside keeping in mind the 
domino effect such an order would have. Given the facts noted above, we shall refrain from 
cancelling the sale or declaring the Sale Deed as void.  Instead, it is deemed appropriate 
to balance the equities by directing the Auction Purchaser to pay an additional amount in 
respect of the subject property. 
CONCLUSION 
36.15  For arriving at a just and fair figure, we propose to take into consideration the 
estimated value of the subject property in terms of the Reports submitted by the Registered 
Valuers appointed by the Liquidator.  Based on their Reports, the Liquidator had fixed 
₹39,41,28,800/- (Rupees Thirty nine crore forty one lakh twenty eight thousand and eight 
 
56 (2008) 9 SCC 299 
57 (2024) 2 SCC 1

hundred only) as the average liquidation value of the subject property for the purpose of 
e-auction.  This figure was brought down by 25% in the second round of auction which 
came to ₹29,55,96,375/- (Rupees Twenty nine crore fifty five lakh ninety six thousand 
three hundred and seventy five only).   The difference in the two figures mentioned above 
comes to ₹10,00,00,000/- (Rupees Ten crore only) approximately.  Keeping in mind the 
fact that the Auction Purchaser managed to retain the balance sale consideration for over 
six months reckoned from 10th February, 2020 and about five months reckoned from 25th 
March, 2020,  we deem it appropriate to direct it to deposit 50% of the differential figure, 
i.e., an additional sum of ₹5,00,00,000/- (Rupees Five crore only) with the Liquidator along 
interest @ 9 % p.a. reckoned from  26th March, 2020 till date of actual payment.  The said
