AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. 
1. These two Appeals have been preferred against the 
final judgment and order dated 05.12.2014 by the 
High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in RFA Nos. 
902 of 2008 and 887 of 2008 (hereinafter referred to 
as the ‘impugned judgment’). While disposing of these 
Regular First Appeals against the judgment and order 
dated 31.03.2008 passed by XII Addl. City Civil and 
Sessions (CCH No. 27) Judge at Bengaluru in O.S No. 
5634 of 1980, by the common impugned order, the

Appellant/Plaintiff is the lawful owner of the suit 
property, has further held that site allotted to 
Defendant No. 20 (Respondent No. 27 in Civil Appeal 
No. 9731 of 2024 and Respondent No. 01 in Civil 
Appeal No. 9732 of 2024) is not the part of Sy. No. 
305/2.  Furthermore, the High Court has held that 
Defendant Nos.9, 10(a), 11(a), 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 23 
and 24 (Respondent Nos.1 to 13 in Civil Appeal No. 
9731 of 2024 and Respondent Nos.10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 
17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 28 and 29 in Civil Appeal No. 
9732 of 2024) are entitled to receive 30 per cent of 
the amount of compensation payable in respect of ten 
sites situated on the suit property.  
2. Aggrieved by the abovesaid findings and directions, 
the Appellant/Plaintiff has preferred these two 
Appeals. For ease of reference, the parties are 
referred to by their original position before the Trial 
Court. The limited questions for consideration before 
this Court are as follows: 
i. 
Whether the High Court by its impugned 
judgment is correct in holding that the 
Appellant/Plaintiff has failed to establish that 

Civil Appeal Nos. 9731-9732 of 2024          
 
Page 3 of 13 
 
the site allotted to Defendant No.20 is not part 
of Sy. No. 305/2. 
ii. 
Whether the High Court by its impugned 
judgment is correct in holding that ten allottees  
(Defendant Nos.9, 10(a), 11(a), 12, 13, 14, 16, 
18, 23 and 24) are entitled to receive 30 per cent 
of amount of compensation payable in respect 
of the ten sites, in spite of holding that the 
Appellant/Plaintiff is the lawful owner of the 
suit property and is entitled for full rights over 
the same. 
3. Before proceeding further, it is pertinent to provide a 
brief factual overview of the case at hand. To 
elaborate, the Appellant/Plaintiff brought forward 
O.S. No. 5634 of 1980 to seek a court declaration 
affirming his title over 1 acre and 12 guntas of land 
situated in Sy No. 132/2, Kempapura Agrahara Inam 
village, Bangalore City. The suit also aimed to secure 
possession of the land and obtain a mandatory 
injunction against Defendant No.20, specifically to 
remove any constructions erected on the suit 
property. In addition to Defendant No.20, the suit 
involved a total of 23 other defendants.  

Civil Appeal Nos. 9731-9732 of 2024

4. It is relevant to mention here that Kempapura 
Agrahara village was an Inam village, and the land 
stood vested in the State in terms of the provisions 
contained in Mysore (Personnel & Miscellaneous) 
Inams 
Abolition 
Act, 
1954 
with 
effect 
from 
01.02.1959.  Consequently, all jodidars retained 
interests corresponding to their respective shares. 
Among them was one Smt. B.C. Subbalakshmamma, 
who held 1/7th share in the village.  Pursuant to an 
application submitted by her to the competent 
authority, 
Smt. 
B.C. 
Subbalakshmamma 
was 
granted occupancy rights for 1 acre and 3 guntas of 
land in Sy No. 132/2, vide order dated 09.12.1969. 
Although the initial mutation was sanctioned in her 
name, the Tehsildar, following an on-site inspection, 
adjusted the records to reflect the actual area in her 
possession. As a result, a revised mutation order 
dated 20.05.1972 was passed, updating the record to 
1 acre and 12 guntas in Sy No. 132/2 in her name. 
The land was subsequently renumbered as Sy No. 
305/2, with a measurement of 1 acre and 12 guntas. 
The Appellant/Plaintiff, Lakshmesh M. acquired this 
land (hereinafter referred to as ‘the suit property’) 

Civil Appeal Nos. 9731-9732 of 2024          
 
Page 5 of 13 
 
from Smt. B.C. Subbalakshmamma through a 
registered sale deed dated 10.06. 1975. 
5. After the Appellant/Plaintiff acquired the suit 
property, the Defendant No. 1, REMCO Industrial 
Workers House Building Cooperative Society Limited 
(Respondent 14 in Civil Appeal No. 9731 of 2024 and 
Respondent 2 in Civil Appeal No. 9732 of 2024), and 
its members attempted to take forcible possession of 
the same. The Defendant No.1-Society claimed rights 
over 4 acres and 2 guntas within Sy No. 305. A survey 
was conducted by the Police based on a complaint 
moved by the Appellant/Plaintiff which indicated that 
the claims of Defendant No.1-Society over suit 
property 
are 
unfounded. 
Aggrieved 
thereby,  
Defendant 
No.1-Society 
filed 
a 
suit 
seeking 
permanent 
injunction. 
Although 
a 
temporary 
injunction was initially granted, the possession of the 
land remained with Defendant No.1-Society. 
6. In such circumstances, the Appellant/Plaintiff filed 
O.S. No. 5634 of 1980, a suit for declaration of his 
title over the suit property and the consequential 
reliefs of mandatory injunction and possession.  This 
suit was partly decreed on 30.10.1986 declaring the 

Civil Appeal Nos. 9731-9732 of 2024          
 
Page 6 of 13 
 
title of the Appellant/Plaintiff over 1 acre and 3 
guntas of the suit property, but the relief of 
possession as sought was dismissed on the ground 
that the sale deed did not detail the land in question 
as the declaration of possession of Smt. B.C. 
Subbalakshmamma was 1 acre and 12 guntas.  Suit 
of declaration for recovery of possession from out of 
the scheduled property which measured 1 acre and 
12 
guntas 
was 
to 
be 
resorted 
to 
by 
the 
Appellant/Plaintiff. 
7. Aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated 
30.10.1986, the Appellant/Plaintiff preferred RFA 
No.747 of 1986 whereas Defendant No.1-Society 
preferred RFA No.191 of 1987. The Regular First 
Appeal as preferred by the Appellant/Plaintiff was 
allowed and that of the Defendant No.1-Society was 
dismissed.   The result thereof was that the suit of 
the Appellant/Plaintiff was decreed.   
8. Subsequently, Defendant No.1-Society preferred Civil 
Appeal Nos.992-993 of 1997 before this Court 
(correcting a typographical error in the impugned 
judgment, referring to the years of the Appeals as 
2007 instead of 1997). By Order dated 28.08.2003, 

Civil Appeal Nos. 9731-9732 of 2024          
 
Page 7 of 13 
 
this Court allowed the said Appeals and remanded 
the case to the Trial Court with directions to consider 
the effect of the order granting occupancy rights in 
favour of one Muniyappa on the subsequent grant 
dated 09.12.1979.  The Court further ordered the 
Trial Court to identify the land covered by both grants 
by framing necessary issues and providing an 
additional opportunity to both parties.  
9. The suit being OS No.5634 of 1980, as remanded by 
this Court was decreed on 31.03.2008, and the 
Appellant/Plaintiff was declared as the owner of the 
scheduled property to the extent of 1 acre and 3 
guntas in Sy No.305/2.  He was also held entitled to 
get 
possession 
of 
the 
same. 
 
The 
Respondents/Defendants preferred appeals against 
this judgment and decree before the High Court of 
Karnataka at Bengaluru.  The Defendant No.1-
Society preferred RFA No.882 of 2008, Defendant 
No.20 preferred RFA No.887 of 2008 and Defendants 
Nos.9, 10(a), 11(a), 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 23 and 24 
preferred RFA No.902/2008.   
10. The High Court vide the impugned judgment dated 
05.12.2014 upheld the judgment passed by the Trial 

Civil Appeal Nos. 9731-9732 of 2024          
 
Page 8 of 13 
 
Court in OS No.5634 of 1980 and dismissed the 
appeal preferred by the Defendant No.1-Society, i.e. 
RFA No.882/2008.  However, RFA No.887 of 2008 
preferred by Defendant No.20 was allowed. The High 
Court set aside the judgment and decree so far as it 
pertained to the land allotted to Defendant No.20, 
declaring that the site allotted to Defendant No.20 
was unrelated to the scheduled suit property.   
11. Regarding RFA No.902 of 2008, the High Court 
determined that Defendants Nos. 9, 10(a), 11(a), 12, 
13, 14, 16, 18, 23, and 24 (hereinafter referred to as 
‘private Defendants’) were entitled to receive 30 per 
cent of the compensation for the acquired portion, 
proportionate to the sites allotted to them in the suit 
property. This amount was to be distributed 
proportionately among these private Defendants. 
Consequently, the High Court partly allowed their 
appeals based on the above terms. 
12. The Appellant/Plaintiff has brought forward these 
Appeals in response to the impugned judgment 
passed by the High Court. 

Civil Appeal Nos. 9731-9732 of 2024          
 
Page 9 of 13 
 
13. It is the contention of the learned Senior Advocate for 
the Appellant/Plaintiff that the High Court has failed 
to appreciate that Defendant No.20 has not stepped 
into the witness box to put forward his claim with 
regard to the allotment of the land in his favour.  He 
further contends that the grant of relief to Defendant 
No.20 in these circumstances is unsustainable.  
14. This contention of the learned Senior Advocate for the 
Appellant/Plaintiff cannot be accepted as the specific 
plea of Defendant No.20 that the site allotted to him 
does not form part of Sy No.305/2, but formed part 
of Sy No.305/3 has not been disputed by the 
Appellant/Plaintiff.  Even the courts below have not 
returned a finding holding that the site allotted to 
Defendant No.20 and the construction made thereon 
by him is part of Sy No.305/2.  Since the 
Appellant/Plaintiff has failed to establish that the site 
allotted to Defendant No.20 was part of Sy No.305/2, 
the High Court has rightly set aside the findings of 
the Trial Court to the said extent.  No interference 
thus on this aspect is called for in the present 
Appeal(s). 
15. The 
learned 
Senior 
Advocate 
for 
the 
Appellant/Plaintiff has further challenged the grant 

Civil Appeal Nos. 9731-9732 of 2024          
 
Page 10 of 13 
 
of relief equal to 30 per cent of the amount of 
compensation payable in respect of the sites which 
were allotted to the private Defendants by asserting 
that for the fault of Defendant No.1-Society, the 
Appellant/Plaintiff cannot be held liable, nor can he 
be forced to share the amount of compensation.  The 
liability, if any, would be of Defendant No.1-Society 
of which these private Defendants were members.  It 
has further been asserted by him that the possession 
and construction, if any, carried out by these private 
Defendants was at their own risk and peril.  After the 
High Court had held the Appellant/Plaintiff to be the 
absolute lawful owner of the suit property, being 
entitled to full rights over the same, these private 
Defendants cannot be held entitled to receive 
compensation payable in respect of the sites built on 
the suit property.  Once it has been held that the 
Appellant/Plaintiff is the owner of the suit property 
merely because these private Defendants are in 
possession of the sites built on the scheduled 
property, they would not be entitled to any 
compensation for the land acquired for the Metro Rail 
Project.   

Civil Appeal Nos. 9731-9732 of 2024          
 
Page 11 of 13 
 
16. Another expostulation which has been put forward by 
the 
learned 
Senior 
Advocate 
for 
the 
Appellant/Plaintiff is that the compensation was 
neither asserted nor claimed by these private 
Defendants at any stage and, in fact, the same was 
not even argued what to say of taking a ground in the 
appeal which has been preferred by the said private 
Defendants before the High Court.  Under such 
circumstances, a portion of the compensation made 
payable for the acquisition of the suit property of 
which the Appellant/Plaintiff is the absolute owner, 
is unacceptable and unsustainable in law. 
17. On the other hand, the learned Senior Advocate for 
the private Defendants submits that the factum of 
possession and construction on the suit property by 
the private Defendants is not disputed.  Once they 
are in possession of the sites built on the land in 
question and that too as per the allotment made by 
Defendant No.1-Society, they have rightly been 
granted the benefit of compensation which is a 
portion of the amount payable for the acquisition of 
the suit property for the Metro Rail Project.  Support 
has, therefore, been made with regard to the grant of 
compensation. 

Civil Appeal Nos. 9731-9732 of 2024          
 
Page 12 of 13 
 
18. We have carefully considered the submissions made 
by the learned Senior Advocate for the parties but are 
unable to accept the stand as has been sought to be 
projected by the learned Senior Advocate for the 
private Defendants.   
It is not in dispute that till date, no claim whatsoever 
has been projected either in the appeal before the 
High Court or before any other competent authority 
for the grant of compensation for the land having 
been acquired. The judgment as has been passed by 
the High Court affirming the ownership and title of 
the suit property in favour of the Appellant/Plaintiff 
has not been challenged by any of these private 
Defendants. The said judgment and the findings 
recorded therein have attained finality.  In the 
absence of any claim with regard to their entitlement 
to compensation for the land acquired, the relief 
granted by the High Court in the appeal is not 
sustainable.  Given the lack of pleadings, evidence on 
record, and submissions made at the time of hearing 
before the High Court, the judgment passed by it 
granting 30 per cent of the amount payable by way of 
compensation in respect of the ten sites in possession 
of the private Defendants, deserves to be set aside. 

Civil Appeal Nos. 9731-9732 of 2024          
 
Page 13 of 13 
 
The Appellant/Plaintiff is entitled to receive the full 
amount payable in respect of acquisition of the suit 
property for the Metro Rail Project.  
19. In the light of the above, the Civil Appeal No.9732 of 
2024, titled as Lakshmesh M. v. C.N. Rangaraju 
(since dead) by LRs. stands dismissed. 
20. The Civil Appeal No.9731 of 2024 titled as 
Lakshmesh M. v. P. Rajalakshmi (since dead) by LRs., 
is hereby allowed. The portion of judgment awarding 
30 per cent of the compensation amount for the sites 
allotted to the private Defendants by Defendant No.1-
Society concerning the suit property is set aside. 
However, the private Defendants are at liberty to seek 
any remedy as may be available to them under the 
law for compensation, if they choose to do so. 
21. There shall be no orders as to costs.
