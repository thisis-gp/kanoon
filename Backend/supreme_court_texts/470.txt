Leave granted. 
 
2. 
Since the issues raised in both the captioned appeals are the same; the 
subject-matter also being the same; the parties are also same and the 
challenge is also to the self-same judgment and order passed by the High 
Court, those were taken up for hearing analogously and are being disposed of 
by this common judgment and order.  
 
3. 
The captioned appeals arise from the common judgment and order passed by 
the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated 9.12.2015 in Writ Petition (C) 
No. 415 of 2011 with Writ Petition (C) No. 418 of 2011 respectively filed by the 
appellant herein by which the High Court rejected both the writ petitions and 
thereby affirmed the common order dated 18.02.2010 passed by the Additional 
Commissioner, Konkan Division, Mumbai setting aside the order of sale 
passed by the Tahsildar, Talasari dated 3.12.2008 as affirmed by the Additional 
Collector, Thane dated 15.01.2009 passed in favour of the appellant herein.  
 
4. 
The subject-matter of the present litigation relates to the legality, validity and 
propriety of the auction proceedings conducted by the Tahsildar, Talasari of the 
subject property which was originally owned by the respondent No. 1 herein, 
namely, Prestige H.M. Polycontainers Limited. 
 
5. 
The subject property owned by the respondent no. 1 herein was put to auction 
under the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 
(hereinafter referred to as “the Revenue Code”). In the said auction

proceedings, the appellant herein was declared as the successful bidder and 
ultimately, sale certificate was issued by the Additional Collector, Thane in 
favour of the appellant. 
 
A. FACTUAL MATRIX  
 
 
6. 
This litigation has a chequered history and therefore, it is necessary for this 
Court to look into the events that occurred over a period of time giving rise to 
the present two appeals before us: 
 
a. The respondent no. 1, M/s Prestige H.M. Polycontainers, executed 
necessary loan and security documents in favour of the State Bank of India 
thereby mortgaging its property situated at Village Vadavali, Taluka Talsari, 
District Thane (Now District Palaghar), Maharashtra (hereinafter referred to 
as “the property”) bearing Survey No. 87/11, admeasuring 13,978 sq. mts. 
Subsequently, the State Bank of India by an assignment agreement 
assigned the debts due and payable to it in favour of the respondent no. 6, 
Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as 
“ARCIL”) under the provisions of The Securitisation and Reconstruction of 
Financial Assets and Enforcement Of Security Interest Act, 2002 
(hereinafter referred to as the “SARFAESI Act, 2002”).  
It is the case of the respondent no. 6 that accordingly it became legally 
entitled to recover the debt due and payable from the respondent no. 1 by 
way of the sale of the property subject to the pre-existing mortgage in 
favour of the respondent no. 6.

Page 10 of 58 
was illegal and accordingly remanded the entire proceedings to the 
Additional Collector, Thane for appropriate fresh adjudication.  
mm. Against the aforesaid order dated 18.06.2010, the appellant filed WP No.   
L-1564 of 2010/W.P. No. 415 of 2011 and WP No. 418 of 2011 before the 
High Court of Judicature at Bombay.  
nn. The High Court in WP No. 1564 of 2010 vide its order dated 07.09.2010 
stayed the operation of the order dated 18.06.2010 and directed the parties 
to maintain the status quo.  
  
 
 
7. 
Both the writ petitions filed by the appellant herein, i.e., Writ Petition (C) No. 
415 of 2011 with Writ Petition No. 418 of 2011 ultimately came to be 
adjudicated by the High Court and vide its impugned judgment & order dated 
9.12.2014 were rejected. The relevant observations made by the High Court 
while rejecting both the writ petitions are as under:  
 
“33. 
Heard the learned counsel for the parties at length. Considering 
the submissions made by both the counsel and after going through the 
pleadings, the issue involved in the petitions is "whether the Petitioner 
has made out a case for setting aside the common order dated 
18/02/2010 passed by the Additional Commissioner, Konkan Division in 
appeal No.195/2009 and 288/2009". 
 
34. 
As per section 192 of the code, for holding an auction, the 
Collector, has to issue a proclamation in a prescribed form with its 
translation in Marathi of the intended sale specifying its time and place, 
along with description of the immovable property. Such proclamation is 
required to be made by beat of drum at the headquarters of Taluka and 
in the village in which the immovable property is situated. As per section 
193 of the Code, a written notice of the intended sale of immovable 
property and its time and place is required to be affixed in the office of 
Collector of District, office of Tahsildar of the Taluka in which the 
immovable property is situate and other public building in the Village in 
which it is situate and the dwelling place. 
 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 11 of 58 
35.  
As per section 195, if the sale is postponed for a period longer 
than 30 days, for sufficient reason, a fresh proclamation and notice is 
required to be issued unless defaulter consents for waiver of it. 
 
36.  
Section 202 to 210 provide a procedure when payment to be 
made, when confirmation of auction sale to be done, how to deal with 
objections before confirmation etc. 
 
37.  
In the present proceedings, admittedly, a fresh notice was issued 
by the Authority on 08/11/2008 for public auction in two newspapers i.e. 
"Nirdhar" and "Dahanu Times" informing the details of the property and 
time and date of auction. The Authority Mandal Adhikari, Talasari issued 
letter dated 19/11/2008 to the owner of the property informing that they 
have pasted the copy of notice on the gate of the suit property. The 
auction was held by the Tahasildar on 03/12/2008 and same was 
confirmed on the same date. This shows that the auction took place 
before expiry of 30 days from the date of proclamation which is contrary 
to section 193 of the Code. Moreover, the Tahasildar confirmed the said 
auction sale in favour of the Petitioner on the same day and handed 
over possession to the suit property receipt executing a possession 
receipt. This means, without waiting for 30 days from the date of 
proclamation, the Tahasildar held a public auction and handed over 
possession to the Petitioner, which was contrary to law. 
 
38. 
It is interesting to note that after handing over possession to the 
Petitioner, the Collector, by order dated 16/01/2009 confirmed the sale 
of the suit property in favour of the Petitioner. That means, before 
confirmation of the auction sale in favour of the Petitioner, the Tahasildar 
on his own, without any authority, handed over possession to the 
Petitioner. This court, in the matter of Shravan Vithoba Dekate (supra) 
in paragraph 12 specifically held that the provisions of the Code in 
respect of the auction sale to be strictly followed. The Apex Court, in the 
matter of Mathew (supra) categorically held that if the Rules framed for 
public auction under the SARFAESI Act are not followed strictly, the 
auction sale is required to be set aside. These facts are considered by 
the Additional Commissioner at the time of passing the impugned order. 
The Additional Commissioner categorically held that the orders passed 
by the Tahasildar as well as the Additional Collector were contrary to the 
provisions of the Code. Hence, the Additional Commissioner Konkan 
Division set aside both the orders and the matter was remanded to the 
Additional Collector to decide on its own merits. 
 
39. 
It is to be noted that, allowing the petition amounts to revival of 
illegal order and same is not permitted in view of the Apex Court 
judgment in the matter of Maharaja Chintamani (supra). 
 
40. 
Considering the above mentioned facts that the Tahasildar as 
well as the Additional Collector, without following due process of law as 
required under the said Code, passed the order dated 3/12/2008 and 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 12 of 58 
15/01/2009 and handed over possession of the suit property to the 
Petitioner and in view of the law declared by the Apex Court as stated 
herein above, I am of the opinion that the Petitioner failed to make out 
any case for interference with the well reasoned impugned common 
order dated 18/02/2010. 
 
41. 
Hence, following order is passed:  
 
a. Rule stands discharged.  
b. Writ Petitions stand dismissed with cost. 
 
42. 
At this stage, the learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that 
the interim protection granted by this court to continue for a period of 12 
weeks to enable the Petitioner to take chance in higher court. 
 
43. 
Considering the fact that the Petitioner is in possession of the 
subject property for last several years and there is a running factory, I 
am of the opinion that the interim protection granted by this court 
(Coram : S. J. Kathawalla, J.) on 07/09/2010 shall continue for a period 
of 12 weeks from today. Same is granted.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
8. 
It appears from the materials on record that against the above referred 
impugned judgment passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court two 
appeals were filed, i.e., (Appeal (L) No. 41 of 2016 in Writ Petition (C) No. 418 
of 2011 with Appeal No. 42 of 2016 in Writ Petition (C) No. 415 of 2011). Both 
these appeals were not pressed by the appellant before the High Court on the 
ground that those were not maintainable in law. Thereafter, on 19.09.2016, the 
two special leave petitions came to be filed before this Court. It appears that 
although the High Court had ordered the parties to maintain status quo pending 
the two writ petitions filed by the appellant, yet on 13.10.2016, i.e., much after 
the two writ petitions came to be rejected by the High Court, the appellant 
created a mortgage on the suit property.

Page 13 of 58 
9. 
In such circumstances referred to above, the respondent No. 6 had to file 
Contempt Petition No. 81 of 2016 in Writ Petition No. 418 of 2016.  
 
10. 
We were informed that the said contempt petition is pending as on date before 
the High Court. This Court vide its order dated 3.11.2019 directed the Debt 
Recovery Tribunal – (I) (hereinafter, “DRT”) at Mumbai to proceed to decide 
the original application filed by the respondent no. 6. These proceedings before 
the DRT were relating to the Mortgage which came to be created by the 
appellant herein. The DRT declared the mortgage over the suit property to be 
illegal and allowed the O.A. No. 168 of 2002 against all the defendants with 
costs for an amount of Rs. 24,15,20,115.76/- with interest @ 12 per cent per 
annum from the date of filing of O.A. till such realisation. 
 
11. 
In such circumstances referred to above, the appellant is here before this 
Court with the present appeals.  
 
B. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 
 
12. 
Mr. P.S. Patwalia, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant, 
vehemently submitted that the High Court committed an egregious error in 
holding that the auction proceeding conducted by the Tahsildar was a sham 
and much contrary to the statutory provisions of the Revenue Code more 
particularly Sections 193 and 194 respectively of the Revenue Code.  
 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 14 of 58 
13. 
The learned Senior Counsel submitted that a written notice of the intended 
sale of the suit property with the time and place thereof was affixed strictly in 
accordance with the conditions as stipulated under Section 193 of the 
Revenue Code. In this regard, our attention was drawn to the findings recorded 
by the High court as contained in para 37 of the impugned judgment of the 
High Court. The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the original 
owner (respondent no. 1) on his own free will and volition had given his consent 
on 20.10.2008 to proceed with the auction sale of the suit property.  
 
14. 
The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the appellant is a bona fide 
purchaser of the suit property in an auction proceeding duly conducted by the 
Tahsildar under the provisions of the Revenue Code.  According to the learned 
Senior Counsel it is not just sufficient to exhibit some material irregularity or 
fraud for the purpose of setting at naught the entire sale. It was argued that the 
aggrieved party must go further and establish to the satisfaction of the Court 
that the material irregularity or fraud had resulted in substantial injury to it.  
 
15. 
According to the learned Senior Counsel, even assuming that the aggrieved 
party in the present litigation suffered substantial injury by reason of the sale 
of the suit property the same would not be sufficient to set aside the sale unless 
substantial injury is shown to have been caused by material irregularity or fraud 
in publishing or conducting the sale.

16. 
With a view to fortify the aforesaid submission strong reliance was placed on 
the decision of this Court in the case of Chilamkurti Bala Subrahmanyam v. 
Samanthapudi Vijaya Lakshmi and Another reported in (2017) 6 SCC 770. 
 
17. 
The learned Senior Counsel, thereafter, proceeded to argue that the two 
appeals filed before the Additional Commissioner, Division Konkan, 
Maharashtra were, by themselves, not maintainable in law. Thus, the 
Additional Commissioner had no jurisdiction to entertain and decide the two 
appeals.  
 
18. 
In this regard, our attention was drawn to the provisions of Section 247 of the 
Revenue Code read in conjunction with Sections 207 and 210 respectively of 
the Revenue Code. It was argued that in view of Sections 207 and 210 
respectively of the Revenue Code the appeals filed by the respondent no. 1 
and 6 before the Additional Commissioner were not maintainable under 
Section 247 of the Revenue Code.  
 
19. 
 It was submitted that the suit property was purchased by the appellant in the 
year 2008 by depositing the amount of Rs. 55 lakhs in accordance with the 
valuation report prepared by two government approved valuers. It was pointed 
out that thereafter, the appellant put up a huge industrial unit for the purpose 
of manufacturing oxygen cylinders. Various permissions and licences from the 
Central Government were obtained for the purpose of setting up the oxygen 
cylinder plant. It was also pointed out that as on date more than two hundred 
workers are employed in the appellant company.

20. 
In such circumstances referred to above, Mr. Patwalia, the learned Senior 
Counsel submitted that if the appellant is asked to hand over the possession 
of the entire suit property at this point of time, he would incur irreparable injury, 
which cannot be compensated in terms of money.  
 
21. 
It was submitted that ordinarily the court should not disturb the sale by auction 
unless it is an evident case of mala fide or a result of fraud. According to Mr. 
Patwalia, sometime back his client had also offered to pay to the lenders the 
market value of the suit property. However, such proposal was not entertained 
by the bankers.  
 
22. 
In such circumstances referred to above, the learned senior counsel prayed 
that there being merit in his appeals, those may be allowed and an appropriate 
order may be passed protecting the interests of all the parties to this litigation.  
 
C. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT NO. 6/Asset 
Reconstruction Co. (India) Ltd. (ARCIL) 
 
23. 
Mr. Amar Dave, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent No. 
6 made the following submissions:  
a. The entire transaction on the basis of which the suit property was taken 
over by the appellant was nothing but absolute fraud perpetrated in 
collusion with each other.   

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 17 of 58 
b. The entire process initiated by the Tahsildar was by supressing various 
critical facts from time to time from the Additional Collector who under the 
scheme of the Act was to approve the process of any such auction and 
pursuant thereto to confirm any such sale under the auction.  
c. The sequence of events clearly indicate that the Tahsildar did not disclose 
to the Additional Collector at the relevant time that there were objections 
already received from one of the banks/financial institution i.e., IFCI and 
the said objections were summarily rejected solely on the ground that the 
sale process in pursuance of the auction was being undertaken as per law. 
In this regard, the provisions of Section 208 of the Revenue Code are 
extremely vital in so far as the same contemplates that even if there is no 
challenge by any other party, the collector himself can set aside any such 
sale or not approve the same for valid reasons. The said provision clearly 
indicates the legislative intent that if there are valid legal objections (which 
in the present case was clearly on the record in so far as IFCI had already 
raised issues with regard to the mortgage of the land) and therefore in 
terms of the said provision the collector was obliged in law to factor the said 
objections and could have examined the issue and not approved the sale. 
However, it is apparent that the Tahsildar kept the office of the Additional 
Collector in dark about the said objection and hence the entire process was 
clearly vitiated.  
d. The Tahsildar, with an oblique motive, initiated proceedings for confirmation 
of the sale without following the mandatory process as laid under the 
scheme of the Act. In fact, the sale was confirmed on 03.12.2008 even 
without ensuring whether the complete payments in respect of the sale 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 18 of 58 
proceed had been fully realised or not. More surprisingly, the perusal of the 
affidavit filed by the Tahsildar in the High court (in the first round of litigation 
filed by Prestige) clearly indicates that the attempt was to suppress the fact 
to the extent that one of the cheques had been realised after the sale 
confirmation 03.12.2008. The cheque was actually realised on 04.12.2008. 
No public authority can confirm a sale without even realizing the entire 
consideration and any such attempt is clearly indicative of the fraudulent 
and collusive nature of the proceedings in question.  
e. That the so-called reliance on the letter of ‘No Objection’ being the entire 
basis of the starting of the final auction proceeding is clearly indicative of 
the fraud perpetuated more particularly when the respondent No. 1 
company, i.e., Prestige H.M. Polycontainers Ltd. clearly declared that no 
such ‘No Objection’ letter was ever signed by it. Even otherwise the 
sequence of events including the newspaper advertisements clearly 
indicate that such a plea of taking “no objection” from the owner and then 
subsequently asking the owner to make payment before the due date is 
indicative of the nature of fraud perpetuated in the present proceedings.  
f. The record reveals that the entire valuation of the immovable as well as the 
movable properties were done in a self-serving manner, and the same was 
done only to benefit the appellant. In this regard, the pleadings clearly 
reflect that the movable properties itself were almost having a market value 
of around Rs. 3 Crore (if not around Rs. 1 crore as per depreciated value 
reflected in the books). In spite of such valuation, the valuer had assigned 
only around Rs. 75, 000 for the entire machinery and shown the same as 
scrap. That apart, even the valuation of the immovable property was 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 19 of 58 
completely incorrect and therefore in the teeth of these glaring facts, the 
entire transaction seems to have been engineered in a fraudulent manner. 
The appellant cannot be termed as bona fide purchaser. 
g. As per the law laid down in the decision of Mathew Varghese v. M. 
Amritha Kumar reported in 2014 (5) SCC 610, it is now well settled that 
30 days’ sale notice is mandatory. The High Court correctly placed reliance 
on the said judgment of this Court to come to the conclusion that sale was 
conducted in breach of various provisions of the Revenue Code which are 
mandatory in nature.  
h. In fact, 30 days’ notice is not just mandatory for the purpose of giving an 
opportunity to the defaulter but also to invite maximum publicity and get 
maximum offer. Admittedly, no 30 days’ sale notice was given. Further, no 
wide publicity was made. 
i. There are various illegalities in confirming the sale as well. In a process of 
sale, first the sale is to be conducted, then the proceeds are required to be 
received. It is only after the receipt of the proceeds that the sale 
confirmation is required to be made by collector and thereafter sale 
certificate and possession is to be handed over.  In the present case, the 
sale was conducted and concluded on the same day i.e., 03.12.2008. The 
sale certificate was issued on the same day without the confirmation from 
the collector and the possession was handed over on the very next day.  
j. From a bare perusal of Section 212 of the Revenue Code, it is evident that 
the purchaser can be put into possession only after confirmation of sale 
and the sale certificate being handed over to the purchaser. However, in 
the present case, the appellant was put in possession on 04.12.2008 and 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 20 of 58 
the sale of property was confirmed on 15.01.2009 by the Additional 
Collector, which is per se illegal in nature. The haste with which the 
proceedings were undertaken speaks for itself.  
k. Indisputably, objection was raised by the IFCI on 10.12.2008, which has 
been recorded by the Tahsildar in its letter dated 19.12.2008.  
l. On 07.01.2009, the Additional Collector, Head Office Jawar directed 
respondent no. 4 to submit a detailed report on whether it had fulfilled all 
the conditions as stipulated under Section 208 of the Revenue Code. 
However, vide its letter dated 12.01.2009 addressed to the Additional 
Collector, Head Office Jawar, respondent no. 4 informed that except for the 
WP in the High Court of Bombay, no other objection was received and 
thereby all requirements under Section 208 of the Revenue Code had been 
fulfilled, despite IFCI having raised its objections vide a letter dated 
10.12.2008.   
 
24. 
As regards the offer put forward by the appellant to deposit the requisite 
amount as per the market value of the property, Mr. Dave fairly submitted that 
sometime back, the appellant had offered to pay to the lenders but as the 
lenders found the offered amount to be very meagre the said proposal was not 
accepted. According to Mr. Dave, the market value of the suit property as on 
date could be around Rs. 6 to 7 crores. 
 
25. 
In such circumstances referred to above, the learned Senior Counsel prayed 
that there being no merit in the appeals those may be dismissed with costs.

D. ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION 
 
 
26. 
Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone 
through the materials on record, the following questions of law fall for our 
consideration:  
a. Whether the provisions of Order XXI Rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure 
would apply to the writ proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution?  
b. Whether the Additional Commissioner, Konkan Division, Maharashtra had 
the jurisdiction to decide the two appeals filed by the respondent nos. 1 and 
6 respectively under Section 247 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 
1966?

F. ANALYSIS 
 
i. 
Whether the provisions of Order XXI Rule 90 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure would apply to the writ proceedings under Article 226 of the 
Constitution?  
 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 27 of 58 
28. 
We shall now proceed to record our findings on the submissions canvassed 
on either side. We start with the decision of this Court in the case of 
Chilamkurti (supra) as strong reliance has been placed on the same on behalf 
of the appellant.  This judgment has been relied upon to make good the 
contention that the provisions of Order XXI Rule 90 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure (hereinafter, “CPC”) should be made applicable to the present 
litigation or in other words even in the writ proceedings under Article 226 of the 
Constitution. This decision is relied upon to fortify the submission that merely 
establishing a material irregularity or fraud is not sufficient to set aside the 
auction sale. It is necessary for the party aggrieved to go further and establish 
to the satisfaction of the court that the material irregularity or fraud in the 
conduct of the auction has resulted in substantial injury to the said party.  
Conversely, even if the party aggrieved has suffered substantial injury by 
reason of the sale, the same would not be sufficient to set aside the auction 
sale unless substantial injury has been shown to have been caused by a 
material irregularity or fraud in publishing or conducting the sale. 
29. 
In Chilamkurti (supra), the respondent no. 2 before this Court was the State 
Bank of India.  The State Bank of India was the plaintiff decree holder, whereas 
the respondent No. 1 was the defendant judgment debtor.  The State Bank of 
India obtained a money decree against the judgment debtor in a suit.  As the 
judgment debtor failed to satisfy the decree, the State Bank of India filed 
execution application and brought the scheduled property owned by the 
judgment debtor to auction sale through the process server of the Court of 
Senior Civil Judge, Kovvur in the execution proceedings for the realisation of 
decretal dues. The suit scheduled property was accordingly attached by the 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 28 of 58 
executing court under a warrant. The property was ultimately put to auction 
sale. The appellant before this Court in the said proceedings was the highest 
bidder. The judgment debtor being dissatisfied with the auction conducted 
under the supervision of the executing court filed an application under Order 
XXI Rule 90 of the CPC seeking setting aside of the sale on the ground that 
the proclamation did not give clear 15 days’ notice and the same was illegal. 
 
30. 
The Senior Civil Court, Kovvur found no merit in any of the objections raised 
by the judgment debtor and accordingly dismissed the application. The 
judgment debtor thereafter preferred an appeal before the High Court. The 
High Court allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the executing court 
inter alia holding that if the judgment debtor deposits a sum of Rs. 7,15,000/- 
(Rs. Seven Lakh Fifteen Thousand Only) being the price fetched at the public 
auction within a period of three weeks from the date of the receipt of a copy of 
the judgment, the sale held would not be given effect to.  
 
31. 
Aggrieved by the aforesaid, the auction purchaser preferred appeal before this 
Court. A Division Bench of this Court in Chilamkurti (supra) relying on the 
decision of this Court in Saheb Khan v. Mohd. Yousufuddin reported in 
(2006) 4 SCC 476, allowed the appeal filed by the successful auction 
purchaser holding as under: -  
“14. The law which governs the controversy involved in this appeal is 
laid down by this Court in Saheb Khan v. Mohd. Yousufuddin  [Saheb 
Khan v. Mohd. Yousufuddin, (2006) 4 SCC 476] (a three-Judge 
Bench). While examining the scope of Order 21 Rule 90 of the Code, 
Ruma Pal, J. speaking for the Bench held as under: (SCC pp. 480-
81, paras 12-14)

“12. We are unable to sustain the reasoning of the High Court. 
Order 21 Rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure allows, inter 
alia, any person whose interests are affected by the sale to 
apply to the court to set aside a sale of immovable property sold 
in execution of a decree on the ground of “a material irregularity 
or fraud in publishing or conducting” the sale. Sub-rule (2) of 
Order 21 Rule 90 however places a further condition on the 
setting aside of a court sale in the following language: 
 
‘90. (2) No sale shall be set aside on the ground of irregularity 
or fraud in publishing or conducting it unless, upon the facts 
proved, the court is satisfied that the applicant has sustained 
substantial injury by reason of such irregularity or fraud.’ 
 
13. Therefore before the sale can be set aside merely 
establishing a material irregularity or fraud will not do. The 
applicant must go further and establish to the satisfaction of the 
court that the material irregularity or fraud has resulted in 
substantial injury to the applicant. Conversely even if the 
applicant has suffered substantial injury by reason of the sale, 
this would not be sufficient to set the sale aside unless 
substantial injury has been occasioned by a material irregularity 
or fraud in publishing or conducting the sale. (See Dhirendra 
Nath 
Gorai v. Sudhir 
Chandra 
Ghosh [Dhirendra 
Nath 
Gorai v. Sudhir Chandra Ghosh, (1964) 6 SCR 1001 : AIR 1964 
SC 1300] , Jaswantlal Natvarlal Thakkar v. Sushilaben Manilal 
Dangarwala [Jaswantlal 
Natvarlal 
Thakkar v. Sushilaben 
Manilal Dangarwala, 1991 Supp (2) SCC 691] and Kadiyala 
Rama Rao v. Gutala Kahna Rao [Kadiyala Rama Rao v. Gutala 
Kahna Rao, (2000) 3 SCC 87] .) 
 
14. A charge of fraud or material irregularity under Order 21 
Rule 90 must be specifically made with sufficient particulars. 
Bald allegations would not do. The facts must be established 
which could reasonably sustain such a charge. In the case 
before us, no such particulars have been given by the 
respondent of the alleged collusion between the other 
respondents and the auction-purchaser. There is also no 
material irregularity in publishing or conducting the sale. There 
was sufficient compliance with Order 21 Rule 67(1) read with 
Order 21 Rule 54(2). No doubt, the trial court has said that the 
sale should be given wide publicity but that does not necessarily 
mean by publication in the newspapers. The provisions of Order 
21 Rule 67 clearly provide if the sale is to be advertised in the 
local newspaper, there must be specific direction of the court to 
that effect. In the absence of such direction, the proclamation of 
sale has to be made under Order 21 Rule 67(1) “as nearly as 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 30 of 58 
may be, in the manner prescribed by Rule 54 sub-rule (2)”. Rule 
54 sub-rule (2) provides for the method of publication of notice 
and reads as follows: 
 
‘54. (2) The order shall be proclaimed at some place on or 
adjacent to such property by beat of drum or other customary 
mode, and a copy of the order shall be affixed on a 
conspicuous part of the property and then upon a 
conspicuous part of the courthouse, and also, where the 
property is land paying revenue to the Government, in the 
office of the Collector of the district in which the land is situate 
and, where the property is land situate in a village, also in the 
office of the Gram Panchayat, if any, having jurisdiction over 
that village.’” 
 
15. After examining the facts of this case in the light of the law laid 
down in Saheb Khan [Saheb Khan v. Mohd. Yousufuddin, (2006) 4 
SCC 476], we are of the considered opinion that the reasoning and 
the conclusion arrived at by the executing court deserves to be 
restored as against that of the High Court in the impugned order. In 
other words, no case was made out by the judgment-debtor for 
setting aside of the sale of the property in question on the ground of 
committing any material irregularity or fraud in publishing or in 
conducting the sale so as to enable the Court to invoke its powers 
under Order 21 Rule 90(2) of the Code. 
16. It is noticed that Respondent 1, in her application for setting aside 
the sale, had mainly raised four objections. Firstly, clear 15 days' 
notice was not given for sale of the properties as required under the 
Rules. Secondly, the valuation of the property was not properly 
mentioned in the documents concerned so as to enable the parties 
to know its proper valuation prevailing on the date of sale. Thirdly, the 
market value of the property on the date of auction was more than 
the price actually fetched in the auction, and fourthly, no proper 
publication including beating of drum was made before the date of 
auction due to which there was less participation of the bidders in the 
auction-sale. 
17. The executing court dealt with all the four objections with 
reference to the record of the proceedings and found as a fact that 
none of the objections had any merit. The High Court, however, found 
fault in the same though not in all but essentially in the matter relating 
to giving of clear 15 days' notice and the manner in which it was 
issued and finding merit in the objection, set aside the sale on 
imposing certain conditions enumerated above. 
18. In our considered opinion, as mentioned above, the executing 
court was justified in overruling the objections and we concur with the 
reasoning and the conclusion of the executing court.

24. The law on the question involved herein is clear. It is not the 
material irregularity that alone is sufficient for setting aside of the 
sale. The judgment-debtor has to go further and establish to the 
satisfaction of the Court that the material irregularity or fraud, as the 
case may be, has resulted in causing substantial injury to the 
judgment-debtor in conducting the sale. It is only then the sale so 
conducted could be set aside under Order 21 Rule 90(2) of the Code. 
Such is not the case here.” 
 
32. 
Thus, the dictum as laid by this Court in Chilamkurti (supra) relying upon 
Saheb Khan (supra) is that a charge of fraud or material irregularity in Order 
XXI Rule 90 CPC must be specifically made with sufficient particulars. Mere 
bald allegation would not be sufficient. The fact must be established which 
could reasonably sustain such charge. The dictum as further laid is that the 
sale conducted by the court in the execution proceedings should not ordinarily 
be set aside merely on the basis of some material irregularity or fraud. The 
party concerned must go further and establish to the satisfaction of the court 
that the material irregularity or fraud has resulted in substantial injury to such 
party. 
 
33. 
Order XXI Rule 90 of the CPC reads as under: - 
"90. Application to set aside sale on ground of irregularity or 
fraud. (1) Where any immovable property has been sold in 
execution of a decree, the decree-holder, or the purchaser, or any 
person entitled to share in a rateable distribution of assets, or 
whose interests are affected by the sale, may apply to the Court 
to set aside the sale on the ground of a material irregularity or fraud 
in publishing or conducting it. 
(2) No sale shall be set aside on the ground of irregularity or fraud 
in publishing or conducting it unless, upon the facts proved, the 
Court is satisfied that the applicant has sustained substantial injury 
by reason of such irregularity or fraud. 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 32 of 58 
(3) No application to set aside a sale under this rule shall be 
entertained upon any ground which could have been taken on or 
before the date on which the proclamation of sale was drawn up. 
Explanation.-The mere absence of, or defect in, attachment of the 
property sold shall not, by itself, be a ground for setting aside a 
sale under this rule.”  
34. 
Legislative changes: By the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 
1976, the following changes have been effected in Rule 90: 
(i) 
In sub-rule (1), the words “or the purchaser” and “other” were 
inserted after the words “the decree-holder” and “or any” 
respectively; 
(ii) 
The proviso to old sub-rule has been renumbered as sub-rule (2) 
with necessary changes in phraseology and with addition of the 
words “in publishing or conducting it” after the words “irregularity 
or fraud”; 
(iii) Sub-rule (3) has been inserted; 
(iv) Explanation to the rule has been added. 
35. 
Object of Amendment: Rule 90, as originally enacted, reads thus: 
“90.(1) Where any immovable property has been sold in 
execution of a decree, the decree-holder, or any other person 
entitled to share in a rateable distribution of assets, or whose 
interests are affected by the sale; may apply to the Court to set 
aside the sale on the ground of a material irregularity or fraud in 
publishing or conducting it. 
     Provided that no sale shall be set aside on the ground of 
irregularity or fraud unless upon the facts proved the Court is 
satisfied that the applicant has sustained substantial injury by 
reason of such irregularity or fraud.” 
 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 33 of 58 
The Law Commission in its Fourteenth Report, Vol. 1, pp. 454-55 
considered the provision and recommended change by stating: - 
“51. Under Rule 90 a sale of immovable property in execution 
of a decree can be set aside on the ground of material 
irregularity or fraud in publishing or conducting the sale. The 
right to apply under this rule is given to the decree-holder or to 
any person entitled to a share in a rateable distribution of assets 
or whose interests are affected by the sale.  It is generally 
accepted that a large percentage of application made by the 
judgment-debtors to set aside sales under this Rule are 
frivolous and are filed with the object of delaying the delivery of 
possession.  It is therefore necessary to make an amendment 
to Rule 90 by providing that no sale shall be set aside on the 
ground of delay in the proclamation of sale at the instance of 
any person who did not attend though given notice to appear at 
the drawing up of the proclamation or of any person, in whose 
presence the proclamation was drawn up, unless an objection 
was taken by him before the sale was held.” 
 
 
 
 
 
  
     (Emphasis supplied) 
 
The Law Commission again considered the question as to irregularity in 
attachment and in its Twenty-seventh Report stated:- 
“The question whether absence of, or irregularity in attachment is, 
a defect in the “publication or conduct of the sale” has been 
discussed in several decisions. At one extreme is the view that 
attachment is not necessary at all before sale. At the other extreme 
stands the view that sale without attachment is void.  A third view 
is, that attachment is an irregularity, but not in publishing or 
conducting the sale.  According to the fourth view, a sale is not a 
nullity because of a defect in the attachment or want thereof, but if 
it causes “substantial injury”, it can be set aside under Rule 90.  
The last view seems to be the correct one. The object of 
attachment is to bring the property under the control of the court, 
and in the case of immovable property one of the requirements is 
that the order of attachment should be publicly proclaimed. The 
main object of the proclamation is to give publicity to the fact that 
the sale of the proclaimed property is in contemplation. The 
publication of the attachment is thus a step leading up to the 
proclamation of the sale. 
The question whether it is necessary to insert a provision to clarify 
the position on the subject, has been considered. In the draft 
Report which had been circulated, an Explanation had been 
proposed to Rule 90 to the effect that absence of or defect in 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 34 of 58 
attachment shall be regarded as an irregularity under this rule.  
After some consideration, it has been decided that no such 
provision need be inserted.” 
 
In its Fifty-fourth Report, the Law Commission ordered: 
“The Commission noted that the question whether the absence 
of, or irregularity in, attachment is, a defect in the “publication or 
conduct of the sale” within Order 21, Rule 90 had been discussed 
in several decisions.  At one extreme was the view that 
attachment is not necessary at all before sale.  At the other 
extreme stood the view that sale without attachment is void.  A 
third view was that want of attachment is an “irregularity” but it is 
not an illegality in publishing or conducting the sale.” 
 
In the Notes on Clauses, Gazette of India dated 8.4.1974, Pt. II S.2, Extra, p. 
325, the State of Objects and Reasons, it was stated: 
“Clause 75, sub-clause (xxxi).-There is a conflict of decisions as to 
whether an auction-purchaser can apply to set aside a sale under 
Rule 90. The words “or the purchaser” have been inserted in the 
rule to make it clear that the auction-purchaser can also apply to set 
aside the sale. 
       The rule is also being amended to provide that a sale shall not 
be set aside on the ground of an irregularity or fraud unless the 
applicant has sustained a substantial injury by reason of such 
irregularity or fraud. 
     It is further being provided that no application to set aside the 
sale shall be entertained on any ground which the applicant could 
have taken on or before the date on which the proclamation of sale 
was drawn up. 
    In view of the divergence of opinion as to whether absence of, or 
irregularity in, attachment is a defect in the publication or the 
conduct of sale, an Explanation is being added to the effect that 
mere absence of or defect in the attachment of the property sold 
shall not, by itself, be a ground for setting the sale.” 
 
36. 
Nature and Scope: Rule 90 of Order XXI deals with cases of setting aside 
auction-sale on the ground of material irregularity or fraud in publishing or 
conducting such sale.  Sub-rule (1) states that where any immovable 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 35 of 58 
property has been sold in execution of a decree, any person adversely 
affected may apply to the court for setting aside sale on the ground of 
material irregularity or fraud in publishing or conducting the sale.  Sub-rule 
(2) is in the nature of proviso to sub-rule (1) and declares that no sale shall 
be set aside unless the applicant proves substantial injury by reason of 
such irregularity or fraud.  Sub-rule (3) bars the court from entertaining an 
application for setting aside sale on any ground which the applicant could 
have taken on or before the date of proclamation of sale.  The Explanation 
to Rule 90 clarifies that mere absence of or defect in, attachment of 
property sold would be no ground for setting aside sale.  
 
37. 
Order XXI of the CPC is exhaustive and in the nature of a complete code as 
to how the execution proceedings should take place. This is the second 
stage after the success of the party in the civil proceedings. This Court in 
many of its decisions has said that this is the second stage after the success 
of the party in the civil proceedings. It is often said in our country that another 
legal battle, more prolonged, starts in execution proceedings defeating the 
right of the party which has succeeded in establishing its claim in civil 
proceedings. This is the reason why Order XXI Rule 90 provides that both 
the conditions enumerated therein should be fulfilled. (See: M/s Jagan 
Singh & Co. v. Ludhiana Improvement Trust & Ors. reported in (2024) 3 
SCC 308)

a. Difference between the auction sale conducted by the court in the 
execution proceedings initiated by the decree holder and the auction 
proceedings conducted by the State through its revenue authorities 
like Tahsildar, etc. 
 
38. 
There is a fine distinction between the auction sale conducted by the 
executing court under the provisions of the CPC and the auction sale 
conducted by the State under the provisions of different enactments like 
Land Revenue Code etc. The whole object behind Order XXI Rule 90 of 
the CPC appears to be to discourage the judgment debtors from filing 
frivolous application complaining about the irregularity or fraud in the 
conduct of the auction sale. A lot of sanctity is attached to the auction sale 
conducted by the executing court under the provisions of the CPC 
compared to the auction sale conducted by the State through its authorities.  
Execution is the enforcement by the process of the court of its orders and 
decrees. This is in furtherance of the inherent power of the court to carry 
out its orders or decrees. Order XXI CPC deals with the elaborate 
procedure pertaining to the execution of orders and decrees. Sale is one of 
the methods employed for execution. Rule 89 of Order XXI of the CPC is 
the only means by which a judgment-debtor can escape from a sale that 
has been validly carried out. The object of the rule is to provide a last 
opportunity to put an end to the dispute at the instance of the judgment-
debtor before the sale is confirmed by the court and also to save his 
property from dispossession.

39. 
We are of the view that even otherwise the provisions of the CPC do not 
apply to writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India except 
some of the principles enshrined therein like res judicata, delay and laches, 
addition of parties, matters which have not been specifically dealt with by 
the writ rules framed by the respective High Court.  
 
Position Prior to 1976 
 
40. 
Before the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976, Section 141 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 read as under: 
“Miscellaneous proceedings.- The procedure provided in this 
Code in regard to suits shall be followed, as far as it can be 
made applicable, in all proceedings in any court of civil 
jurisdiction.” 
  
41. 
 There was cleavage of opinion on the question whether the provisions of 
the Code would apply to writ proceedings under the Constitution. Some 
High Court had held that writ petitions could be said to be proceedings in 
‘any court of civil jurisdiction’ within the meaning of Section 141 of the CPC. 
According to other High Courts, however, writ proceedings, being special in 
nature, were not covered by Section 141 and the provisions of the Code 
were not applicable to writ petitions. 
 
42. 
 In State of U.P. v. Vijay Anand reported in AIR 1963 SC 946, drawing the 
distinction between ordinary civil jurisdiction and extraordinary civil 
jurisdiction, a Constitution Bench of this Court stated:- 
“It is, therefore, clear from the nature of the power conferred under 
Article 226 of the Constitution and the decisions on the subject that 
the High Court in exercise of its power under Article 226 of the 
Constitution exercises original jurisdiction, though the said 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 38 of 58 
jurisdiction shall not be confused with the ordinary civil jurisdiction 
of the High Court. This jurisdiction, though original in character as 
contrasted with its appellate and revisional jurisdiction, is 
exercisable throughout the territories in relation to which it 
exercises jurisdiction and may, for convenience, be described as 
extraordinary original jurisdiction.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
43. 
Again, in Babubhai Muljibhai Patel v. Nandlal Khodidas Barot reported 
in (1974) 2 SCC 706, construing the words ‘as far as it can be made 
applicable’ in Section 141 of the CPC (prior to Amendment of 1976), this 
Court observed: 
 
“10. It is not necessary for this case to express an opinion on the 
point as to whether the various provisions of the Code of Civil 
Procedure apply to petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution. 
Section 141 of the Code, to which reference has been made, 
makes it clear that the provisions of the Code in regard to suits 
shall be followed in all proceedings in any court of civil jurisdiction 
as far as it can be made applicable. The words “as far as it can be 
made applicable” make it clear that, in applying the various 
provisions of the Code to proceedings other than those of a suit, 
the court must take into account the nature of those proceedings 
and the relief sought. The object of Article 226 is to provide a quick 
and inexpensive remedy to aggrieved parties. Power has 
consequently been vested in the High Courts to issue to any 
person or authority, including in appropriate cases any 
government, within the jurisdiction of the High Court, orders or 
writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, 
prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari. It is plain that if the 
procedure of a suit had also to be adhered to in the case of writ 
petitions, the entire purpose of having a quick and inexpensive 
remedy would be defeated. A writ petition under Article 226, it 
needs to be emphasised, is essentially different from a suit and it 
would be incorrect to assimilate and incorporate the procedure of 
a suit into the proceedings of a petition under Article 226.”  
        (Emphasis supplied) 
 
Position After 1976 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 39 of 58 
 
44. 
By the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976, Explanation to 
Section 141 came to be inserted. It reads thus: 
“Explanation.-In this section, the expression “proceedings” includes 
proceedings under Order IX, but does not include any proceeding 
under Article 226 of the Constitution.” 
 
45. 
In the Statement of Objects and Reasons, it has been stated: 
 
“The question of whether an application under Article 226 of the 
Constitution is a ‘proceeding in any court of civil jurisdiction’ within 
the meaning of Section 141 has been the subject matter of 
controversy. While the Andhra Pradesh High Court holds that 
Section 141 applies to such proceedings, the Allahabad, Calcutta, 
Madras and Punjab High Court have held that Section 141 does not 
apply to such proceedings and in the circumstances, it is being 
clarified that Section 141 does not apply to proceedings under 
Article 226 of the Constitution.” 
 
46. 
In view of the Explanation to Section 141 of the CPC, now it can no longer 
be contended that the provisions of CPC would apply to the proceedings 
under Article 226 of the Constitution. 
 
47. 
This Court in Puran Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab & Ors. reported in 
(1996) 2 SCC 205, in paras 9, 10 and 11 respectively has held as under:-  
“9. In the case of Ram Kala v. Asstt. Director, Consolidation of 
Holdings [AIR 1977 P&H 87 : 79 Punj LR 100] , a Full Bench of 
three Judges held that Article 137 of the Schedule to the 
Limitation Act does not apply to an application for adding or 
substituting a party to a petition under Article 226 of the 
Constitution. It was also held that Section 141 of the Code cannot 
be pressed into service for applying the provisions including 
Order 22 of the Code in a petition under Article 226 of the 
Constitution. Later a Full Bench of five Judges of the same Court 
in the case of Teja Singh v. Union Territory of Chandigarh [AIR 
1982 P&H 169; (1981) 1 SLR 274 : 84 Punj LR 160] held that in 
view of Rule 32 of the Writ Rules framed by the High Court under 
Article 225 of the Constitution which provided that in all matters 
in which no provision had been made by those Rules, the 
provisions of Civil Procedure Code shall apply mutatis mutandis 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 40 of 58 
insofar as they were not inconsistent with those Rules the 
explanation which had been added to Section 141 of the Code by 
the aforesaid Amending Act, did not in any way nullify the effect 
of Rule 32 of the Writ Rules. Rule 32 of the Writ Rules is as 
follows: 
 
“32. In all matters for which no provision is made in these 
rules, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, 
shall apply mutatis mutandis insofar as they are not 
inconsistent with these rules.” 
 
10. On a plain reading, Section 141 of the Code provides that 
the procedure provided in the said Code in regard to suits shall 
be followed “as far as it can be made applicable, in all 
proceedings”. In other words, it is open to make the procedure 
provided in the said Code in regard to suits applicable to any 
other proceeding in any court of civil jurisdiction. The explanation 
which was added is more or less in the nature of proviso, saying 
that the expression ‘proceedings’ shall not include any 
proceeding under Article 226 of the Constitution. The necessary 
corollary thereof shall be that it shall be open to make applicable 
the procedure provided in the Code to any proceeding in any 
court of civil jurisdiction except to proceedings under Article 226 
of the Constitution. Once the proceeding under Article 226 of the 
Constitution 
has 
been 
excluded 
from 
the 
expression 
‘proceedings’ occurring in Section 141 of the Code by the 
explanation, how on basis of Section 141 of the Code any 
procedure provided in the Code can be made applicable to a 
proceeding under Article 226 of the Constitution? In this 
background, how merely on basis of Writ Rule 32 the provisions 
of the Code shall be applicable to writ proceedings? Apart from 
that, Section 141 of the Code even in respect of other 
proceedings contemplates that the procedure provided in the 
Code in regard to suits shall be followed “as far as it can be made 
applicable”. Rule 32 of Writ Rules does not specifically make 
provisions of Code applicable to petitions under Articles 226 and 
227 of the Constitution. It simply says that in matters for which 
no provision has been made by those rules, the provisions of the 
Code shall apply mutatis mutandis insofar as they are not 
inconsistent with those rules. In the case of Rokyayabi v. Ismail 
Khan [AIR 1984 Kant 234 : (1984) 2 Kant LC 114] in view of Rule 
39 of the writ proceedings rules as framed by the Karnataka High 
Court making the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure 
applicable to writ proceedings and writ appeals, it was held that 
the provisions of the Code were applicable to writ proceedings 
and writ appeals. 
 
11. We have not been able to appreciate the anxiety on the part 
of the different courts in judgments referred to above to apply the 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 41 of 58 
provisions of the Code to writ proceedings on the basis of 
Section 141 of the Code. When the Constitution has vested 
extraordinary power in the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 
to issue any order, writ or direction and the power of 
superintendence over all courts and tribunals throughout the 
territories in relation to which such High Court is exercising 
jurisdiction, the procedure for exercising such power and 
jurisdiction have to be traced and found in Articles 226 and 227 
itself. No useful purpose will be served by limiting the power of 
the High Court by procedural provisions prescribed in the Code. 
Of course, on many questions, the provisions and procedures 
prescribed under the Code can be taken up as guide while 
exercising the power, for granting relief to persons, who have 
invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court. It need not be 
impressed that different provisions and procedures under the 
Code are based on well-recognised principles for exercise of 
discretionary power, and they are reasonable and rational. But 
at the same time, it cannot be disputed that many procedures 
prescribed in the said Code are responsible for delaying the 
delivery of justice and causing delay in securing the remedy 
available to a person who pursues such remedies. The High 
Court should be left to adopt its own procedure for granting relief 
to the persons concerned. The High Court is expected to adopt 
a procedure which can be held to be not only reasonable but 
also expeditious.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    (Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
48. 
As a court of plenary jurisdiction, the writ court while exercising powers 
under Article 226 of the Constitution is free to adopt its own procedures and 
follow them. It cannot be compelled to follow the procedures prescribed in 
the CPC. This is so for the specific provision made in its Section 141.  
 
49. 
The High Court while exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the 
Constitution has jurisdiction to pass appropriate orders. Such power can 
neither be controlled nor affected by the provisions of Order XXI Rule 90 of 
the CPC.  It would not be correct to say that the terms of Order XXI Rule 90 
should be mandatorily complied with while exercising jurisdiction under

Constitution stand on a different footing when compared to the proceedings 
in suits or appeals arising therefrom. 
 
50. 
The High Court exercises its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the 
Constitution of India, whereas the Civil Courts exercise their jurisdiction in 
terms of the provisions of the respective State Civil Courts Acts read with 
Section 9 of the CPC.  The High Court exercises constitutional function, the 
Civil Court exercises a statutory function. The High Court exercises a wide 
power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and in a given situation, 
it can even mould the reliefs in order to do substantial justice between the 
parties.  
 
51. 
Where a particular mode is prescribed for doing an act and there is no 
impediment in adopting the procedure, the deviation to act in a different 
manner which does not disclose any discernible principle which is 
reasonable itself is liable to be labelled as arbitrary. The State action must 
be informed by reason and it follows that the action uninformed by reason 
is per se arbitrary. The basic requirement of Article 14 is fairness in action 
by the State and non-arbitrariness in essence and substance is the 
heartbeat of fair play. These actions are amenable to the judicial review not 
only to the extent that the State must act validly for a discernible reason 
and not whimsically for any ulterior purpose. The public authorities are 
governed by the “rule of law”.  Such authorities are constitutionally obliged 
in law to maintain absolute fairness and transparency during the conduct 
of the auction sale right from the initiation of the same till its completion.

Judicial audit and scrutiny play a key role in ensuring that the public 
authorities do not act in an unreasonable manner. 
 
52. 
The dictum as laid by this Court in Tata Cellular v. Union of India reported 
in (1994) 6 SCC 651 is that the judicial power of review is exercised to rein 
in any unbridled executive functioning. It was observed that the restraint 
has two contemporary manifestations viz. one is ambit of judicial 
intervention and the other covers the scope of the court’s ability to quash 
an administrative decision on its merits. These restraints bear the hallmarks 
of judicial control over administrative action. It was held that the principle of 
judicial review is concerned with reviewing not the merits of the decision in 
support of which the application for judicial review is made, but the 
decision-making process itself. It was held that the principle of judicial 
review would apply to the exercise of contractual powers by the 
Government bodies in order to prevent arbitrariness or favouritism. It was 
held that the duty of the court is to confine itself to the question of legality 
and its concern should be whether a decision-making authority exceeded 
its powers; whether it committed an error of law or committed a breach of 
the rules of natural justice or reached a decision which no reasonable 
tribunal would have reached or, abused its powers. The grounds upon 
which an administrative action can be subjected to judicial review are 
classified as illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. In that very 
decision, while deducing the principles from various cases referred, it was 
held that the modern trend points to judicial restraint in administrative 
action; that the Court does not sit as a court of appeal but merely reviews 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 44 of 58 
the manner in which the decision was made; that the court does not have 
the expertise to correct the administrative decision and if a review of the 
administrative decision is permitted, it will be substituting its own decision, 
without the necessary expertise which itself may be fallible; that the terms 
of the invitation to tender cannot be open to judicial scrutiny because the 
invitation to tender is in the realm of contract; and, that the government 
must have freedom of contract, i.e. a free-play in the joints is a necessary 
concomitant for an administrative body functioning in an administrative 
sphere or quasi-administrative sphere. However, the decision must not only 
be tested by the application of Wednesbury principle of reasonableness, 
but must be free from arbitrariness not affected by bias or actuated by mala 
fides. Moreover, quashing decisions may impose heavy administrative 
burden on the administration and lead to increased and unbudgeted 
expenditure. 
 
53. 
In Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa and Others reported in (2007) 14 
SCC 517, this Court observed as under:  
“22. Judicial review of administrative action is intended to prevent 
arbitrariness, irrationality, unreasonableness, bias and mala fides. 
Its purpose is to check whether choice or decision is made “lawfully” 
and not to check whether choice or decision is “sound”. When the 
power of judicial review is invoked in matters relating to tenders or 
award of contracts, certain special features should be borne in 
mind. A contract is a commercial transaction. Evaluating tenders 
and awarding contracts are essentially commercial functions. 
Principles of equity and natural justice stay at a distance. If the 
decision relating to award of contract is bona fide and is in public 
interest, courts will not, in exercise of power of judicial review, 
interfere even if a procedural aberration or error in assessment or 
prejudice to a tenderer, is made out. The power of judicial review 
will not be permitted to be invoked to protect private interest at the 
cost of public interest, or to decide contractual disputes. The 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 45 of 58 
tenderer or contractor with a grievance can always seek damages 
in a civil court. Attempts by unsuccessful tenderers with imaginary 
grievances, wounded pride and business rivalry, to make mountains 
out of molehills of some technical/procedural violation or some 
prejudice to self, and persuade courts to interfere by exercising 
power of judicial review, should be resisted. Such interferences, 
either interim or final, may hold up public works for years, or delay 
relief and succour to thousands and millions and may increase the 
project cost manifold.”

54. 
This Court in State of Punjab & Others v. Mehar Din reported in (2022) 
5 SCC 648, after referring to both the aforesaid decisions held as under: 
“20. The scope of judicial review in the matters of tenders/public 
auction has been explored in depth by this Court in a catena of 
cases. Plausible decisions need not be overturned and, at the same 
time, latitude ought to be granted to the State in exercise of its 
executive power. However, allegations of illegality, irrationality and 
procedural impropriety would be enough grounds for courts to 
assume jurisdiction and remedy such ills.” 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
55. 
We are of the view that in cases such as the one at hand wherein the 
legality, validity and propriety of the auction sale conducted by the State 
through its authorities is questioned on the ground of mala fides, undue 
favour for extraneous considerations and gross violation of the mandatory 
provisions of law, it would be hazardous to apply the principles enshrined 
in Order XXI Rule 90 of the CPC. Times have changed. Human values and 
ethics in public functionaries have degraded to a considerable extent. 
Corruption is on a rampage. Having regard to the same and in order to 
protect and uphold the rule of law, the courts have a duty to ensure that the 
State authorities have conducted public auctions in a fair and transparent 
manner and have not done anything by which public exchequer has 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 46 of 58 
suffered. It would be too much to say that although the writ court may find 
an auction sale conducted by a public functionary to be in gross violation 
of the mandatory provisions of law and the action of such public functionary 
to be arbitrary, yet the aggrieved party complaining about the same should 
be told to establish the dual conditions stipulated in Order XXI Rule 90 of 
the CPC. Once the action of the State is found to be unfair and arbitrary, 
then that is the end of the matter so far as a writ court is concerned.  The 
first and the foremost aspect that the writ court should look into is fairness 
and transparency on the part of the State in conducting the auction sale so 
as to be in conformity with Article 14 of the Constitution.  
 
56. 
The litigation at hand is one of gross violation of the mandatory provisions 
of the Revenue Code in so far as conduct of the auction sale is concerned.  
In terms of Section 194 of the Revenue Code, no sale shall take place until 
after the expiration of at least 30 days from the latest date on which any of 
the notice shall have been affixed as required by Section 193 of the 
Revenue Code. The materials on record reveal that the auction of the 
property was conducted before the expiry of 30 days’ time as prescribed 
under Section 194 of the Revenue Code. At the cost of repetition, Section 
194 of the Revenue Code is reproduced hereunder:- 
“Section 194: (1) Sale shall be made by auction by such persons as 
the Collector may direct. 
(2) No such sale shall take place on a Sunday or other general 
holiday recognised by the State Government¸ nor until after the 
expiration of at least thirty days in the case of immovable property, 
or seven days in the case of movable property, from the latest date 
on which any of the said notices shall have been affixed as required 
by section 193.” 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 47 of 58 
 
57. 
Further, in terms of Section 195 of the Revenue Code, a fresh notice is 
required to be issued if the sale is postponed for any reason beyond 30 days 
and a fresh proclamation and notice has to be issued unless the defaulter 
consents to waive it.  In this regard, it is relevant to note that a fresh 
proclamation was made on 23.11.2008 in furtherance of Section 195 of the 
Revenue Code. At the cost of repetition, Section 195 of the Revenue Code 
is reproduced hereunder:- 
“Section 195. Postponement of sale.─The sale may from time 
to time be postponed for any sufficient reason: 
       Provided that, when the sale is postponed for a period longer 
than thirty days a fresh proclamation and notice shall be issued 
unless the defaulter consents to waive it.” 
 
58. 
Various illegalities were committed even in confirming the sale. In a process 
of sale, first the sale is to be conducted, then the proceeds are required to 
be received. It is only after the receipt of the proceeds that sale confirmation 
is required to be made by the collector and thereafter sale certificate and 
possession is to be handed over.  In the present case, the sale was 
conducted and concluded on the same day i.e., 03.12.2008. The sale 
certificate was issued on the same day and that too without the confirmation 
from the collector and the possession was also handed over on the very 
next day.  
 
59. 
From a bare perusal of Section 212 of the Revenue Code, it is evident that 
the purchaser can be put into possession only after confirmation of sale and 
the sale certificate being handed over to the purchaser. However, in the 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 48 of 58 
present case, the appellant was put in possession on 04.12.2008 and the 
sale of property was confirmed on 15.01.2009 by the Additional Collector, 
which is per se illegal in nature. Again at the cost of repetition, Section 212 
of the Revenue Code is reproduced hereunder:- 
“Section 212. On confirmation of sale, purchaser to be put in 
possession. Certificate of purchase.— After a sale of any 
occupancy or alienated holding has been confirmed in the manner 
aforesaid, the Collector shall put the person declared to be the 
purchaser into possession of the land and shall cause his name to 
be entered in the land records as occupant or holder in lieu of that 
of the defaulter and shall grant him a certificate to the effect that 
he has purchased the land to which the certificate refers.” 
  
60. 
Indisputably, although a specific objection was raised by the IFCI on 
10.12.2008, as recorded by the Tahsildar in its letter dated 19.12.2008, yet the 
objection was suppressed from the Additional Collector. 
 
61. 
On 07.01.2009, the Additional Collector, Head Office Jawar directed the 
respondent no. 4 to submit a detailed report on whether it had fulfilled all the 
conditions as stipulated under Section 208 of the Revenue Code. At the cost 
of repetition, Section 208 of the Revenue Code is reproduced hereunder:- 
“Section 208: Order confirming or setting aside sale.—On the 
expiration of thirty days or, as the case may be, one hundred and 
eighty days from the date of the sale, if no such application as is 
mentioned in section 207 has been made, or if such application has 
been made and rejected, the Collector shall make an order 
confirming the sale:”  
 
62. 
However, respondent no. 4, vide its letter dated 12.01.2009 addressed to the 
Additional Collector, Head Office Jawar, misinformed that except for the writ 
petition pending before the High Court of Bombay, no other objection was 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 49 of 58 
received and thereby all requirements under Section 208 of the Revenue Code 
had been fulfilled, despite IFCI raising its objections.  
 
63.  From the aforesaid, the following inescapable conclusions are discernible: 
a. The sale of the Property took place before the expiry of the mandatory 
30 days’ notice. This clearly shows that the sale was conducted in 
breach of the provisions of Section 194 of the Revenue Code. The notice 
was issued on 19.11.2008 and the auction came to be conducted on 
03.12.2008.   
b. The sale certificate was issued on the same day, i.e., on the date of the 
auction itself, much before the confirmation of sale by the Additional 
Collector. This clearly shows that the sale was conducted in breach of 
the provisions of Section 212 of the Revenue Code. 
c. The purchaser, that is, the appellant was put in possession of the 
property much before the sale came to be confirmed i.e. on 15.01.2009 
and that too prior to the cheque being realised. This clearly shows 
that the sale was conducted in breach of the provisions of Sections 212 
and 208 respectively of the Revenue Code.  
d. The undue haste exhibited by the Tahsildar in completing the sale in 
favour of the appellant speaks for itself. Why did the Tahsildar supress 
an important fact before the Additional Collector as regards the 
objections received by him from IFCI? This itself indicates that there was 
some collusion between the Tahsildar and the appellant.  
 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016

64. 
The aforesaid lapses, in our opinion, cannot be termed as irregularity. Once 
it is evident that the mandatory provisions as stipulated under the rules and 
regulations are not followed or abridged, any action pursuant to the same 
could be termed as gross illegality. There is a fine distinction between 
illegality and irregularity.   Whereas the former goes to the root of the matter 
and renders the action null and void, of no effect whatsoever, the latter does 
not ipso facto invalidate the action, unless prejudice is caused to the person 
making a complaint, even if, for the purposes of Order XXI Rule 90 of the 
CPC the lapses we have taken note of could be termed as material 
irregularities going to the root of the matter.  
 
65. Almost a century back, in Ashutosh v. Behari Lal (1908) 35 Cal 61, drawing 
the distinction between ‘nullity’ and ‘irregularity’, Mookerjee, J. stated; 
“No hard and fast line can be drawn before a nullity and 
irregularity; but this much is clear, that an irregularity is a deviation 
from a rule of law which does not take away the foundation of 
authority for the proceeding, or apply to its whole operation, 
whereas a nullity is a proceeding that is taken without any 
foundation for it or is so essentially defective as to be of no avail 
or effect whatever, or is void and incapable of being validated”.  
 
66. 
Whether a provision falls under one category or other is not of easy 
discernment, and in the ultimate analysis it depends upon the nature, scope 
and object of a particular provision. A workable test, however, has been laid 
down in Holmes v. Russel (1841) 9 Dowl 487, wherein it was held thus: 
  “It is difficult sometimes to distinguish between an irregularity 
and a nullity, but the safest rule to determine what is an 
irregularity and what is a nullity is to see whether the party can 
waive the objection; if he can waive it, it amounts to an 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 51 of 58 
irregularity; if he cannot, it is a nullity.” [see Dhirendra Nath v. 
Sudhir Chandra] 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
67. 
If we were to condone or overlook all the illegalities we have taken note of 
in para 63 of this judgment, applying the provisions of Order XXI Rule 90 of 
the CPC, the same would result in nothing but gross travesty of justice. 
Bureaucracy feels that accountability is an impediment to efficient 
discharge of the duty. Accountability is no more and no less than, the 
concept of accountability of a private concern to their shareholders. There 
is a distinction between prying into details of day-to-day administration and 
of the legitimate actions or resultant consequences thereof. To enthuse 
efficiency into administration, a balance between accountability and 
autonomy of action should be carefully maintained. Over-emphasis on 
either would impinge upon public efficiency. But undermining the 
accountability would give immunity or carte blanche power to deal with the 
public property or of the debtor at whim or vagary. Whether the public 
authority acted bona fide would be gauged from the impugned action and 
attending circumstances. The authority should justify the action assailed on 
the touchstone of justness, fairness, reasonableness and as a reasonable 
prudent owner. Test of reasonableness is stricter. The public functionaries 
should be duty conscious rather than power charged. Its actions and 
decisions which touch the common man have to be tested on the 
touchstone of fairness and justice. That which is not fair and just is 
unreasonable. And what is unreasonable is arbitrary. An arbitrary action is 
ultra vires. It does not become bona fide and in good faith merely because 
no personal gain or benefit to the person exercising discretion has been 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 52 of 58 
established. An action is mala fide if it is contrary to the purpose for which 
it was authorised to be exercised. Dishonesty in discharge of duty vitiates 
the action without anything more. An action is bad even without proof of 
motive of dishonesty, if the authority is found to have acted contrary to 
reason. [See: Mahesh Chandra v. Regional Manager, U.P. Financial 
Corporation & Ors : (1993) 2 SCC 279] 
ii. 
Whether the Additional Commissioner, Konkan Division, Maharashtra 
had the jurisdiction to decide the two appeals filed by the respondent 
nos. 1 and 6 respectively under Section 247 of the Maharashtra Land 
Revenue Code, 1966? 
 
68. 
We shall now proceed to deal with the contention canvassed on behalf of 
the appellant that the Additional Commissioner, Konkan Division, State of 
Maharashtra had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the two appeals filed by the 
respondent no. 1 and respondent no. 6 herein respectively.  It was argued 
that the appeals filed before the Additional Commissioner under Section 
247 of the Revenue Code were not maintainable as there was a remedy 
available under Section 210 of the same code.    
 
69. 
Application before the Collector to get the Sale set aside has to be made 
within a period of 30 days.  It is after considering the objections that the sale 
is to be confirmed. Section 210 of the Revenue Code reads: 
“Section 210. Application to set aside sale by person 
owning to holding interest in property.— (1) Where 
immovable property has been sold under this Code, any person 
either owning such property or holding an interest therein by 
virtue of a title acquired before such sale may, at any time within 
thirty days from the date of sale, apply to the Collector to have 
the sale set aside on his holding depositing- 
 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 53 of 58 
(a) For payment to the purchaser a sum equal to five per cent 
of the purchase money 
(b) For payment on account of the arrear, the amounts 
specified in the proclamation of sale as that for the recovery 
of which the sale was ordered, less any amount which may 
have been paid since the date of sale on that account; and  
(c) The cost of the sale: 
  Provided that, such application may be made by such person 
belonging to a Schedule Tribe within one hundred and eighty 
days from the date of sale. 
(2)    If such deposit is made within thirty days or, as the case 
may be, one hundred and eighty days from the date of sale, 
the Collector shall pass an order setting aside the sale.” 
 
 
70. 
As rightly argued by Mr. Dave, the said remedy was rendered illusory as 
the sale was finalised by the Tahsildar much before the confirmation by 
the Collector.  In fact, the sale certificate was issued & the possession 
was also handed over to the appellant. The confirmation was done by the 
Tahsildar much before the expiry of 30 days.  There was nothing left for 
the Collector to consider and decide under Section 210 of the Revenue 
Code. It is further pertinent to note that the provision may be applicable 
in case of owner of the property but not to a lender who has valid 
subsisting mortgage.  The argument that lender is not required to make 
deposit before challenging the sale is not something which is borne on 
plain reading of the language of Section 210. 
 
71. 
Section 210(1) of the Revenue Code provides that an application can be 
made where an immovable property has been sold under the Revenue 
Code by i) owner of the property; and ii) holding interest therein by virtue 
of a title acquired before such sale. It would be relevant to state that the 
respondent No. 6 does not fall within the category as provided under 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 54 of 58 
Section 210(1) of the Revenue Code nor has the respondent No. 6 
claimed to be the owner of the property or has an interest in the property 
by virtue of the “title acquired”. 
 
72. 
The confirmation of the sale had no bearing after the issuance of sale 
certificate. Therefore, the remedy under Section 210 was rendered 
illusory and not a remedy actually available as the certificate of sale was 
already issued.  Further, once the sale certificate is issued, then the 
remedy falls under Section 247 instead of Section 210 of the Revenue 
Code. At the cost of repetition, Section 247 of the Revenue Code is 
reproduced hereunder: 
“Section 247: Appeal and appellate authorities.—(1) In the 
absence of any express provisions of the Code, or of any law for 
the time being in force to the contrary, an appeal shall lie from any 
decision or order passed by a revenue or survey officer specified in 
column 1 of the Schedule E under this  Code or any other law for 
the time being in force to the officer specified in column 2 of that 
Schedule whether or not such decision or order may itself have 
been passed on appeal from the decision or order of the officer 
specified in column 1 of the said Schedule: 
  Provided that, in no case the number of appeals shall exceed two. 
 (2) When on account of promotion or change of designation an 
appeal against any decision or order lies under this section to the 
same officer who has passed the decision or order appealed 
against, the appeal shall lie to such other officer competent to 
decide the appeal to whom it may be transferred under the 
provisions of this Code.” 
 
 
73. 
Assuming for the moment that the Additional Commissioner had no 
jurisdiction to adjudicate and decide the two appeals filed by the 
respondent No. 1 and respondent No. 6 respectively, yet the common 
order passed by the Additional Commissioner allowing the appeals and 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 55 of 58 
remanding the matter back to the authority concerned could not have 
been disturbed and the High Court rightly did not disturb the same. Had 
the High Court taken the view that the Additional Commissioner had no 
jurisdiction and the order passed by it was a nullity, the result would have 
been the revival of the illegal order passed by the Additional Collector 
confirming the sale.   
 
74. 
It is well settled principle in law that issuance of a writ or quashing/setting 
aside of an order if revives another pernicious or wrong or illegal order 
then in that eventuality the writ court should not interfere in the matter 
and should refuse to exercise its discretionary power conferred upon it 
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The writ court should not 
quash the order if it revives a wrong or illegal order. Vide : Gadde 
Venkateswara Rao v. Government of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1966 SC 
828; Maharaja Chintamani Saran Nath Shahdeo v. State of Bihar,

CONCLUSION 
 
75. 
In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the view that no interference 
is warranted with the impugned judgment of the High Court. However, the 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 56 of 58 
facts and circumstances of this case have left us with an uphill task to 
mould the final order necessary to be passed in order to do substantial 
justice with the parties to this litigation.  
 
76. 
Having taken the view that the High Court committed no error, much less 
any error of law, we could have dismissed both the appeals and closed 
this litigation. However, doing the same will put the appellant in immense 
difficulties. As noted in the earlier part of this judgment, the appellant has 
set up an oxygen cylinder manufacturing plant on the suit property. It has 
invested a huge amount in setting up this plant and has been running this 
plant for almost 15 years. Approximately 200 employees are working in 
the said plant. If the possession of the suit property is taken over, then 
the plant will have to be dismantled unless in any fresh auction 
proceedings some person is interested in taking over the entire plant with 
the land. In such circumstances, we deem fit to give one opportunity to 
the appellant to save its industrial unit set up on the subject land. If the 
appellant wants to save the industrial unit and the land, it must deposit a 
sum of Rs. 4,00,00,000/- (Rupees Four Crore Only) with the respondent 
no. 6-ARCIL towards full and final settlement of all liabilities. No other 
lender or financial institution shall thereafter put forward any further claim, 
even if any. It is for the respondent no. 6-ARCIL to deal with such a 
situation.  
 
77. 
In view of the aforesaid, both the appeals are allowed in part. While 
affirming the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, 

 
      Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) No. 29334-35 of 2016 
   
 
Page 57 of 58 
we direct the appellant to deposit a sum of Rs. 4,00,00,000/- (Rupees 
Four Crore Only) with the respondent no. 6-ARCIL within a period of six 
months from today, failing which we shall proceed to pass further orders.  
 
78. 
Let this matter be notified once again before this Bench to report whether 
the appellant has deposited the amount of Rs. 4,00,00,000/- (Rupees 
Four Crore Only) with ARCIL or not. We clarify that if the appellant fails 
to deposit the amount, we shall direct the competent authorities to take 
over the possession of the entire unit with the land in question and put 
the same once again for sale by way of fresh auction process. 
 
79.
