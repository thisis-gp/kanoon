an immovable property located adjacent to the 
Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple, 
namely, 
Kamakala 
Kameshwarar Temple (hereinafter referred to as the 
“suit property” or “Schedule ‘A’ property”). The suit 
property and the Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple were 
owned by one late Rai Raja Eswardoss Diawanth 
Bahadur. On his death, the properties dwelled upon 
his son Mr. T. Lakshmidoss and his grandson Mr. T. 
Venkataprasad. They were declared as insolvents vide 
Order dated 27.04.1914 passed by the Madras High 
Court. In pursuance thereto, the Official Assignee 
became the possessor of the properties in the said 
authority.  
3. Thereupon, 
Mr. 
T. 
Lakshmidoss 
and 
Mr. 
T. 
Venkataprasad arrived at an arrangement with the 
creditors and with the intent of annulling the 
declaration of their insolvency obtained a Decree 
dated 31.12.1915. According to the said decree, the 
Official Assignee was required to divide the estate 
between the said two insolvents in the proportion of 
three-fourth and one-fourth respectively, subject to 
clearance of the amounts due to the creditors. For the 
purposes of making payments of such outstanding 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 3 of 22 
 
dues, Mr. T. Lakshmidoss and Mr. T. Venkataprasad 
agreed to sell some of their properties, including the 
suit property. The said sale was made in favour of one 
Mr. W. Ramakrishna Lala for an amount of INR 
1,10,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Ten Thousand only). 
Consequently, 
two 
Conveyance-cum-Sale 
Deeds 
dated 23.03.1917 were executed in favour of Mr. W. 
Ramakrishna Lala, who executed a Trust Deed dated 
12.12.1917 appointing three trustees by name, Mr. 
M.S. Anantha Ram Lala, Mr. A.S. Subba Rao and Mr. 
C. Ranganadhan Nayudu (proprietor of creditor-
company, namely, M/s Dowden and Company). As 
stipulated under the said Trust Deed, these trustees 
were empowered to sell all the properties except for 
the family house which is the suit property. Also, the 
income derived from the properties was required to be 
distributed between Mr. T. Lakshmidoss and Mr. T. 
Venkataprasad in a ratio of 3:1.  
4. On 07.02.1924, Mr. T. Lakshmidoss and Mr. T. 
Venkataprasad were adjudged as insolvents for the 
second time resulting in vesting of the possession of 
the properties again in the Official Assignee. An 
Agreement dated 15.09.1925 came to be entered into 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 4 of 22 
 
with the creditors where the three trustees were also 
associated. The suit seeking specific performance of 
the said Agreement dated 15.09.1925 was preferred 
by the creditors namely, M/s Devakinandan Dubey 
and Sons where apart from the debtors, the 
aforementioned three trustees were impleaded as 
defendants. The said suit was decreed in favour of the 
creditors vide Compromise Decree dated 26.11.1929. 
To the said decree were appended three separate 
schedules which were marked as Schedule ‘A’ which 
comprised of the suit property, Schedule ‘B’ 
encompassed the properties which stood excluded 
from the Trust dated 12.12.1917, and Schedule ‘C’ 
relating to the Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple. It is this 
Decree dated 26.11.1929 which holds the key with 
regard to the nature of the property which is a subject 
matter of the present lis.  
5. Pursuant to the terms of the said decree, the Official 
Assignee along with the two insolvents, and Mr. W. 
Ramakrishna Lala executed a Conveyance Deed 
bearing No. 1113 of 1931 for the transfer of the suit 
property enumerated in Schedule ‘A’ subject to 
certain cogent conditions and another Conveyance 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 5 of 22 
 
Deed bearing No. 1114 of 1931 comprising of the 
Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple 
stipulated 
in 
the 
Schedule ‘C’, in favour of the then spiritual head of 
the Guru Manicka Prabhu Temple and his successors 
in office.  
6. Subsequently, a set of proceedings was initiated by 
the Appellant-Defendant in 1954 whereby an 
application being O.A. No. 76 of 1954 was moved 
before the Deputy Commissioner of Hindu Religious 
and Charitable Endowments (hereinafter referred to 
as the “HR & CE”) seeking hereditary trusteeship in 
the Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple. The said application 
was initially allowed, however, in an appeal the same 
was reversed vide Order dated 31.12.1954. A suit 
bearing Original Suit No. 557 of 1955 assailing the 
said decision of the appellate authority preferred by 
the Appellant-Defendant also met the same fate of 
dismissal and so was the appeal, being A.S. No. 14 of 
1960, moved thereafter.  
After the decision of the appeal, an application being 
C.M.P. No. 5404 of 1962 for withdrawal of suit was 
filed with a plea that the claim of the hereditary 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 6 of 22 
 
trusteeship was made by mistake and that the 
Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple was his private property. 
7. It is thereafter that in April 1962 another application 
being O.A. No. 38 of 1962 was preferred before the 
Deputy Commissioner of HR & CE putting forth a 
claim that the Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple was a 
private temple. The said application was dismissed 
vide Order dated 04.10.1963 and an appeal assailing 
the said order was also dismissed. Subsequently, the 
Appellant-Defendant preferred a civil suit being 
Original Suit No. 547 of 1965 to overturn these 
orders. The said suit was decreed, and a declaration 
as prayed for that Kamakala Kameshwarar Temple 
being the Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple herein was a 
private temple was granted vide Judgment dated 
10.02.1965. The decree was affirmed in an appeal. 
Thereupon, an Appeal being L.P.A. No. 119 of 1983, 
preferred before a Division Bench of the Madras High 
Court by the Respondent-Plaintiff was allowed vide 
Judgment dated 04.04.1990, thereby setting aside 
the decree of declaration in favour of the Appellant-
Defendant 
and 
consequently 
declaring 
the 
Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple as a public temple. 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 7 of 22 
 
Further, a challenge to the said decision before this 
Court by way of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 326 
of 1991 was dismissed vide Order dated 07.10.1991. 
Consequently, the Judgment dated 04.04.1990 of the 
Division Bench of the Madras High Court attained 
finality and the Respondent-Plaintiff Kamakala 
Kameshwarar Temple became a public temple. 
8. With this the claim as regards the Appellant-
Defendant in the present proceedings came to an end 
with the opening up of a new chapter which emerged 
with the filing of a suit being Original Suit No. 921 of 
1999 by the Respondent-Plaintiff in the Madras High 
Court, wherein the Respondent-Plaintiff herein 
sought a declaration of being the absolute owner of 
the plaint schedule property with a direction for the 
delivery of possession thereof. The learned Single 
Judge of the Madras High Court proceeded to hold 
vide its Judgment dated 26.04.2011 that the suit 
property is a trust property whilst relying on the 
contents of the Compromise Decree dated 26.11.1926 
and the conveyance deeds executed in pursuance 
thereof. The High Court, upon perusal of the 
conditions encapsulated in the said compromise 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 8 of 22 
 
decree and the admissions made by the Appellant-
Defendant in his cross-examination, concluded that 
the suit property along with other properties 
contained in Schedule ‘C’ of the said decree was 
conveyed to the Appellant-Defendant for the purposes 
of utilisation of income thereof for a limited object of 
maintenance and upkeep of the Respondent-Plaintiff-
Temple as well as the Guru Manicka Prabhu Temple. 
Moreover, the High Court noted that the Appellant-
Defendant forfeited his position as a trustee over the 
suit property, as well as the Respondent-Plaintiff-
Temple upon failure to utilise the income for the 
aforesaid 
restricted 
purpose 
and 
rather 
misappropriating such funds for personal use. 
Consequently, the Court required the Appellant-
Defendant to handover the possession of the suit 
property to the Respondent-Plaintiff. Accordingly, the 
suit was decreed as sought for by the Respondent-
Plaintiff.  
9. The Appellant-Defendant being aggrieved by the 
aforesaid decision of learned Single Judge preferred 
an appeal being Original Appeal No. 272 of 2011 
before the Division Bench of the Madras High Court, 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 9 of 22 
 
which was dismissed vide Impugned Judgment dated 
26.10.2017 holding therein that the suit property is a 
trust property and if the Appellant-Defendant was in 
its possession, it was only as a trustee and not as an 
absolute owner. The reasons for arriving at such 
conclusion was a comprehensive analysis of the terms 
of transfer of the suit property stipulated in the 
Compromise Decree dated 26.11.1929 conspicuously 
paragraph numbers 01 to 04, 11, and 13, as also the 
subsequent conduct of the Appellant-Defendant in 
pursuing multiple proceedings whilst maintaining the 
claim for hereditary trusteeship till 1962 and the 
absence of any sale consideration backing the claim 
of absolute vesting in favour of the Appellant-
Defendant. 
Such 
perusal 
of 
the 
documents 
incentivised the Division Bench to adjudge the suit 
property as one belonging to the trust. Moreover, the 
Division Bench unequivocally rejected the argument 
that the proceedings were barred by the principle of 
res judicata considering the previous proceedings 
which declared an adjacent property, namely, the 
Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple to be a public temple, as 
relating to an issue distinct from the present 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 10 of 22 
 
proceedings, which do not impact the nature of the 
suit property herein.    
10. Assailing the judgment of the Division Bench of the 
Madras High Court, the Appellant-Defendant has 
approached this Court in the present Appeal. It is the 
case of the Appellant-Defendant that the Respondent-
Plaintiff had neither presented any pleadings or 
evidence, nor raised any issue claiming the suit 
property as a trust property. Bereft of such pleadings, 
it is the submission that the High Court ought not to 
have decided on the issue as to the nature of the suit 
property. In addition, it was contended that the suit 
filed by the Respondent-Plaintiff before the learned 
Single Judge of the Madras High Court did not adhere 
to the requirements contemplated under Section 92 
of Code of Civil Procedure 1908, which specially deals 
with suits against trusts, hence, bolstering the 
contention that the suit property was never intended 
to be conceived by the Respondent-Plaintiff to be a 
trust property.  
11. Furthermore, drawing reference from the contents of 
the Compromise Decree dated 26.11.1929, the 
Appellant-Defendant asserted that the suit property 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 11 of 22 
 
is not a trust property rather under his absolute 
ownership as the said decree required modifications 
to the Trust Deed dated 12.12.1917 in case the 
property were to be a trust property, but no such 
modifications were made, nor was any trust deed 
executed and the Conveyance Deed made pursuant 
thereto explicitly identifies the Appellant-Defendant 
as the transferee with absolute ownership, not as a 
trustee. Additionally, it was contended that the 
responsibility for maintaining the temples would not 
tantamount to limiting the vesting of the suit 
property, rather such conditions are inconsistent and 
void by virtue of Sections 10 and 11 of the Transfer of 
Property Act 1882, and the property does not revert 
after a set period. To buttress this contention, the 
Appellant-Defendant submitted that the Trust Deed 
of 1917 and the Conveyance Deed thereto did not 
confer the status of a trustee to the spiritual head of 
Guru Manicka Prabhu Temple. 
12. Per contra, it is the case of the Respondent-Plaintiff 
that the Appellant-Defendant initially claimed title 
over the suit property as a hereditary trustee but later 
asserted that the Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple is a 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 12 of 22 
 
private entity. The issue of whether the Respondent-
Plaintiff-Temple is public or private has been 
previously addressed in the proceedings bearing LPA 
No. 119 of 1983, and the same issue is being re-
litigated now. It was, therefore, asserted by the 
Respondent-Plaintiff that the suit property and 
Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple 
being 
identical 
properties to the properties enumerated in the 
Compromise Decree dated 26.11.1929, the present 
proceedings, being subsequent proceedings, is barred 
by the principle of res judicata.  
13. Furthermore, it is the case of the Respondent-Plaintiff 
that post taking over of the possession of the temple 
by the HR & CE from the Appellant-Defendant, it has 
maintained the suit property and managed it as a 
public temple since 1946, consequently, asserting 
that the Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple being a declared 
public institution under HR & CE’s stewardship, the 
property should remain under Respondent-Plaintff’s 
management to protect public worship and ensure 
proper maintenance.  
14. Having heard the learned Senior Advocate for the 
Appellant-Defendant and the Counsel for the 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 13 of 22 
 
Respondent-Plaintiff, it is pertinent to adjudge the 
present challenge in light of the aforementioned 
chronology of facts and proceedings.   
15. Considering the submissions made by the parties 
herein and the factual backdrop as has been 
delineated in the earlier part of the judgment which is 
not being repeated for brevity, it is evident that the 
present challenge relating to the title over the suit 
property rests on the interpretation of terms and 
conditions enumerated under the Compromise 
Decree dated 26.11.1929. The Appellant-Defendant 
posits absolute ownership over the suit property 
obverse to the claim of the Respondent-Plaintiff being 
the persistent nature of suit property as trust 
property. Therefore, it is apposite to delve into a 
comprehensive analysis of the relevant paragraph 
numbers 01 to 04, 11, and 13 of the Compromise 
Decree dated 26.11.1929, as has been reproduced by 
the Division Bench of the Madras High Court in 
paragraph number 12 (vii) of the Impugned Judgment 
which reads as follows: 
(1) “That the provisions of the Trust deed 
dated the 12th day of December 1917 shall 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 14 of 22 
 
attach only to the property described in 
Schedule “A” hereto and even in so far as 
those properties shall immediately be 
incested 
(sic: 
Vested) 
in 
Sri 
Guru 
Marthanda Manicka Guru as Head of the 
Guru Manicka Prabhu Temple and his 
successors in office as Head of the said 
Temple, subject to the condition that the 
net worth (sic: monthly) income from the 
said properties ascertained after payment 
of repairs and taxes, as and when the 
same accrues be applied and utilised by 
the said Sri Guru Marthanda Manicka 
Prabhu for the maintenance of the 
defendants Nos. 7 and 8 and of the 
survivor of them, during their lifetime. 
(2) That after the death of the survivor of the 
7th and 8th defendants the head of the said 
Guru Manicka Prabhu Temple for the time 
being do pay to Ponbati Bai (sic: Parvati 
Bai) the sister of the 8th defendant during 
the term of her natural life from and out of 
the said income the sum of Rupees Forty 
(Rs.40/-) per mensem and the balance of 
the said income shall be utilised by him for 
the purpose of the said temple. 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 15 of 22 
 
(3) That after the death of the said Ponbati Bai 
(sic: Parvati Bai) the said premises and the 
income thereof shall absolutely vest in the 
Guru of the said temple for the time being 
and be utilised for the maintenance and 
upkeep of the said Manicka Prabhu Gadi 
and the Kamakala Kameswarar Temple 
founded by the late Rai Raja Eswaradas 
Daiwanth Bahadur, the father of the 7th 
defendant, 
and 
situated 
in 
Raja 
Hanumantha 
Lala 
Street, 
Triplicane, 
Madras. 
(4) That the remaining properties includes (sic: 
included) in the said. trust deed dated the 
12th day of December 1927 (sic - 1917) 
and (in) particular set out in schedule "B" 
here to be and are hereby exonerated from 
the said Trust and that the said properties 
are the absolute properties of the 7th and 
8th defendants, and they have already 
vested in the 2nd defendant. 
xxxx 
(11) That for the purposes of giving effect to 
paragraph 1 of this decree, the 2nd and 3rd 
defendants shall execute in favour of the 
spiritual Head of the Guru Manicka 
Prabhu Temple a conveyance of the 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 16 of 22 
 
properties set out in schedule “A” hereto 
and the said spiritual Head of the said 
temple shall execute in favour of the 6th 
defendant 
a 
power 
of 
attorney 
empowering him to manage the properties 
set out in schedule "A" hereto during the 
life of the 7th and 8th defendants and the 
survivor of them and the said Parbati Bai 
(sic: Parvati Bai) and for the purpose of 
making the payment set out in paragraphs 
1 and 2 above and during such time the 
said 6th defendant shall hold possession 
of the said premise. 
xxxx  
(13) That the 2nd, 7th  and 8th defendants shall 
execute in favour of the spiritual Head of 
the said Kamakala Kameswarar Temple a 
Conveyance of the building comprising the 
said temple and the land on which the 
same 
is 
situate 
more 
particularly 
described in schedule "C" hereto that the 
application of the monthly income from the 
properties set out in schedule "A" in the 
manner indicated above shall be in the 
nature of a provision for maintenance and 
the said income shall not be liable to be 
alienated or anticipated (sic: appropriated) 
by the 7th and 8th defendants or the said 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 17 of 22 
 
Parbati Bai (sic: Parvati Bai) to be attached 
or proceeded against by the creditors of 
the 7th and 8th defendants and the said 
Parbati Bai (sic: Parvati Bai)...."  
16. A perusal of the above would show that the provisions 
of the Trust Deed dated 12.12.1917 were restricted to 
property described in Schedule ‘A’, that is, the suit 
property herein. The said property would forthwith 
vest in Shri Guru Marthanda Manicka Prabhu as the 
head of the Guru Manicka Prabhu Temple and his 
successors in office. The monthly income as would be 
derived from the said property after payment of 
repairs and taxes in relation to the temple would be 
utilized for Mr. T. Lakshmidoss and Mr. T. 
Venkataprasad during their lifetime. 
17. As stipulated in paragraph number 02 of the decree, 
post the death of Mr. T. Lakshmidoss and Mr. T. 
Venkataprasad, the head of the Guru Manicka 
Prabhu Temple for the time being was to pay during 
the lifetime a sum of INR 40/- (Rupees Forty only) per 
month to Ms. Parvati Bai, being daughter of Mr. T. 
Lakshmidoss and sister of Mr. T. Venkataprasad and 
the remaining income had to be utilized for the 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 18 of 22 
 
purposes of the temple. After the death of Ms. Parvati 
Bai, the Schedule ‘A’ property which is the suit 
property as also the income derived therefrom would 
vest absolutely in Guru of the Manicka Prabhu 
Temple for the purpose of maintenance and upkeep 
of Guru Manicka Prabhu Temple and Kamakala 
Kameshwarar Temple, i.e. the Respondent-Plaintiff 
Temple herein.  
18. The remaining properties as mentioned in the Trust 
Deed dated 12.12.1917 as provided for in Schedule 
‘B’ were excluded from the trust as contemplated by 
paragraph number 04 of the said decree. This can be 
said with regard to the properties and their utilization 
which are found in paragraph numbers 01 to 04.  
19. Paragraph numbers 11 and 13 enumerate the steps 
to be undertaken to give effect to the process of 
rescheduling of the suit property out of properties 
which formed part of the Trust Deed dated 
12.12.1917, in other words, to materialize what was 
contemplated by virtue of paragraph number 01 of the 
decree. Paragraph number 11 specifically required 
the Official Assignee and Mr. W. Ramakrishna Lala to 
execute in favour of the spiritual head of the Guru 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 19 of 22 
 
Manicka Prabhu Temple a conveyance of properties 
as spelt out in Schedule ‘A’. On this part, the spiritual 
head of the Manika Prabhu Temple shall execute a 
Power of Attorney in favour of Mr. C. Ranganathan 
Nayudu, the proprietor of M/s Dowden and Company, 
that is, the creditor’s company, to manage the 
properties set out in Schedule ‘A’ during the lifetime 
of Mr. T. Lakshmidoss and Mr. T. Venkataprasad as 
also Ms. Parvati Bai for the purpose of executing the 
terms of payment set out as mentioned in paragraph 
numbers 01 and 02. It is during this period that the 
creditor shall hold possession of the suit property. 
20. Further, paragraph number 13 required the Official 
Assignee, 
Mr. 
T. 
Lakshmidoss, 
and 
Mr. 
T. 
Venkataprasad to execute a conveyance deed of the 
building comprising of Kamakala Kameshwarar 
Temple, i.e. the Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple herein 
through 
its 
spiritual 
head 
qua 
the 
building 
comprising the said temple including the land 
situated thereon more particularly as described in 
Schedule ‘C’ of the decree. 
21. It is pertinent to emphasise herein that the income 
derived from the properties set out in Schedule ‘A’ as 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 20 of 22 
 
also in Schedule ‘B’ were not to be alienated or 
appropriated by Mr. T. Lakshmidoss, Mr. T. 
Venkataprasad, and Ms. Parvati Bai nor could the 
creditors 
proceed 
against 
the 
said 
schedule 
properties.  
In the above perspective, it is apparent that the said 
properties as provided in Schedules ‘A’ and ‘C’ could 
neither be alienated by any of the parties nor 
proceeded against by the creditors. What in effect it 
means is that they continue to be a part of the trust 
property. 
22. It would not be out of the way to mention here that 
the parties to this decree acted upon the same as is 
apparent from the two transfer deeds dated 
28.08.1931 executed by the Official Assignee, Mr. T. 
Lakshmidoss and Mr. T. Venkataprasad and Mr. W. 
Ramakrishan Lala. Document bearing no. 1113 of 
1931 (Exhibit D-1) was executed by Official Assignee 
along with Mr. W. Ramkrishna Lala and Document 
bearing No. 1114 of 1931 (Exhibit P-8) was executed 
by the Official Assignee in favour of the spiritual head 
of Guru Manicka Prabhu Temple. 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 21 of 22 
 
23. From the aforementioned analysis, it is apposite to 
conclude that except for Schedule ‘B’ properties, 
properties in Schedule ‘A’ and ‘C’ existed and 
continued to be a part of the trust. This leads us to a 
logical corollary that the head of the Guru Manicka 
Prabhu Temple (Appellant-Defendant herein) could 
hold the property in Schedule ‘A’ which is the suit 
property as a trustee only, and not in any other 
capacity. 
24. Another plea raised by the Counsel with reference to 
application of principle of res judicata for averring a 
bar on the present proceedings was rightly rejected by 
the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of 
the Madras High Court on account of distinct nature 
of claims in both proceedings, that is, previous 
proceedings dealt with the issue of nature of 
Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple as being public or 
private temple, whereas the present proceedings 
relate to a suit for declaration of title over the suit 
scheduled property. It was rightly pointed out by the 
learned Single Judge of the High Court that the 
nature of the Respondent-Plaintiff-Temple would not 
affect the obligations envisaged by the Compromise 

Civil Appeal No. 8374 of 2024     
     
 Page 22 of 22 
 
Decree dated 26.11.1926 in relation to the suit 
scheduled property herein. Hence the challenge 
raised in the earlier proceedings cannot be said to 
impact the present litigation.  
25. In light of the above, we are in agreement with the 
judgment passed by the Division Bench of the Madras 
High Court which is impugned herein. Consequently, 
the present Appeal being devoid of merit is hereby 
dismissed.  
26. There shall be no order as to costs.  
27. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
