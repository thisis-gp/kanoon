2.1. The Respondent(s) filed a Consumer Complaint No. 
280 of 2015 before the NCDRC on 12.05.2015, 
claiming a total amount of INR 47,36,25,000 (Indian 
Rupees Forty Seven Crore Thirty Six Lakh Twenty 
Five Thousand) as compensation on account of inter 
alia the death of his wife due to alleged medical 
negligence; and adoption of unfair trade practices  by 
the Petitioner(s) herein whilst conducting a left 
thoracotomy i.e., mediastinal tumour excision under 
general anaesthesia (the “Underlying Complaint”). 
2.2. 
In this context, vide an order dated 14.05.2015, the 
NCDRC issued notice to the opposite party i.e., the 
Appellants herein. 
2.3. The Notice was received by the Appellant(s) on 
27.05.2015; and accordingly, the Appellant(s) ought to 
have filed its’ WS within a period of 30 (thirty) days 
thereafter i.e., on or before 28.06.2015. However, the 
Appellant(s) filed its WS together with an application 
seeking condonation of delay on 12.04.2016 before the 
NCDRC i.e., after a delay of 285 (two hundred eighty-
five) days beyond the 30 (thirty) day period granted to 
Appellant(s). 
2.4. Vide the Impugned Order, the NCDRC closed the right 
of the Appellant(s) from filing their written statement on 

C.A. No. 1970 of 2020 
 
Page 3 of 8 
 
account of them exceeding the statutory period 
prescribed for filing such written statement, under 
Section 13 of the Act.  
2.5. Aggrieved by the aforesaid, the Appellant(s) preferred 
the Special Leave Petition No. 36048 of 2016 i.e., now 
converted to this instant appeal. 
2.6. Vide an order dated 16.12.2016, this Court issued notice 
in the instant appeal; and directed the Appellant(s) to 
pay a sum of INR 50,000 (Indian Rupees Fifty 
Thousand) as costs to the Respondent(s) pursuant to 
which upon receiving consent from the Respondents 
herein, the NCDRC was at liberty to proceed with the 
adjudication 
of 
the 
Underlying 
Complaint. 
Alternatively, the Respondents herein were free to seek 
a stay of proceeding(s) before the NCDRC pending 
disposal of the instant appeal. 
2.7. Vide an order dated 01.11.2017, on account of the non-
acceptance of the aforesaid cost(s) by the Respondents 
herein, the NCDRC kept further proceeding(s) in 
abeyance in terms of the order dated 16.12.2016 passed 
by this Court. 
2.8. In the interregnum, a co-ordinate bench of this Court, 
noticed a conflict of opinion(s) in inter alia New India 
Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage

(P) Ltd., (2015) 16 SCC 20 (“New India Assurance 
1”); J.J. Merchant (Dr) v. Shrinath Chaturvedi, (2002)

Salem Advocate Bar Association v. Union of India, 
(2005) 6 SCC 344; and Topline Shoes Limited v. 
Corporation Bank, (2002) 6 SCC 33, and accordingly, 
placed similarly placed appeal(s) before a Constitution 
Bench of this Court vide an order dated 30.10.2017, with 
a view to bring a sense of finality vis-à-vis the manner 
of operation of Section 13 of the Act (the “Constitution 
Bench”) .  
2.9. Pertinently, the Constitution Bench vide its decision in 
New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose 
Cold Storage (P) Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 757 (hereinafter 
“New India Assurance 2”) categorically observed that 
the rigours of Section 13 of the Act needed to be 
complied with mandatorily; however, on account of 
various conflicting decision(s) of this Court, the 
Constitution Bench clarified that New India Assurance 
2  (Supra) would operate prospectively. 
2.10. Pertinently, during the pendency of New India 
Assurance 2 (Supra), a Division Bench of this Court in 
Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mampee 
Timbers & Hardwares (P) Ltd., (2021) 3 SCC 673 held 

C.A. No. 1970 of 2020 
 
Page 5 of 8 
 
that the consumer fora were permitted to accept written 
statements beyond the stipulated maximum 45 (forty-
five) day period in an appropriate case on suitable terms. 
This position was followed by this Court pursuant to the 
New India Assurance 2 (Supra) in respect of 
application(s) seeking condonation of delay in filing the 
written statements/reply that either had been decided or 
were pending prior to 04.03.2020 i.e., the date of 
pronouncement of New India Assurance 2 (Supra)1. 
2.11. Despite the aforesaid, a divergent view came to be taken 
by a Division Bench of this Court in Daddy's Builders 
(P) Ltd. v. Manisha Bhargava, (2021) 3 SCC 669 
observed as under:  
“7. As observed by the National Commission that 
despite sufficient time granted the written 
statement was not filed within the prescribed 
period of limitation. Therefore, the National 
Commission has considered the aspect of 
condonation of delay on merits also. In any case, 
in view of the earlier decision of this Court in J.J. 
Merchant [J.J. Merchant v. Shrinath Chaturvedi, 
(2002) 6 SCC 635] and the subsequent 
authoritative decision of the Constitution Bench of 
this Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli 
Multipurpose Cold Storage (P) Ltd. [New India 
Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold 
Storage (P) Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 757 : (2020) 3 SCC 
(Civ) 338] , Consumer Fora have no jurisdiction 
and/or power to accept the written statement 
beyond the period of 45 days, we see no reason to

interfere with the impugned order [Daddy's 
Builders (P) Ltd. v. Manisha Bhargava, 2020 SCC 
OnLine NCDRC 697] passed by the learned 
National Commission.” 
 
2.12. In this context, a 3 Judge Bench of this Court in 
Diamond Exports v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd., 
(2022) 4 SCC 169 were tasked with inter alia 
reconciling and authoritatively settling the divergent 
views taken by this Court in respect of underlying 
complaint(s) either pending or instituted prior to 
04.03.2020 i.e., the date of pronouncement of New 
India Assurance 2 (Supra). Thus, in this context, this 
Court in Diamond Exports (Supra) categorically held 
that Daddy's Builders (P) Ltd. (Supra) would not affect 
applications seeking condonation of delay that were 
pending or decided on or before 04.03.2020, and 
accordingly, such application(s) seeking condonation of 
delay would be entitled to the benefit granted by this 
Court in Mampee Timbers (Supra). The relevant 
paragraph is reproduced as under:  
“24….Thus, the decision in Daddy's Builders 
[Daddy's Builders (P) Ltd. v. Manisha Bhargava, 
(2021) 3 SCC 669 : (2021) 2 SCC (Civ) 319] would 
not affect applications that were pending or 
decided before 4-3-2020. Such applications for 
condonation would be entitled to the benefit of the 
position in Mampee Timbers & Hardwares 
[Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mampee 
Timbers & Hardwares (P) Ltd., (2021) 3 SCC 673 

C.A. No. 1970 of 2020

: (2021) 2 SCC (Civ) 323] which directed 
Consumer Fora to render a decision on merits. We 
have expounded on the above principles in order to 
adopt a bright-line standard which obviates 
uncertainty on the legal position before the 
Consumer Fora and obviates further litigation.” 
3. 
Turning to the issue at hand, the undisputed fact(s) of the 
present lis reveal that the Impugned Order was passed by the 
NCDRC on 22.07.2016 i.e., prior to 04.03.2020 the date of 
pronouncement of the decision in New India Assurance 2 
(Supra) by the Constitution Bench.  Accordingly, in this 
background it was contended by the Appellant(s) that on account 
of the prospective operation of the said decision, coupled with 
the observations of this Court in Diamond Exports (Supra), the 
instant appeal ought to be allowed with a direction to the NCDRC 
to render a decision on merits qua the underlying application 
seeking condonation of delay in filing the WS. 
4. 
In the considered opinion of this Court, the categorical 
observation(s) of the Constitution Bench in New India 
Assurance 2 (Supra); coupled with the finding(s) of a Bench of 
3 Judges of this Court in Diamond Exports (Supra) have 
authoritatively brought quietus to the underlying issue. The 
application(s) seeking condonation of delay preferred before the 
consumer fora prior to 04.03.2020 i.e., the date of 
pronouncement of New India Assurance 2 (Supra), must be 
decided on merits; and ought not to be summarily dismissed. 

C.A. No. 1970 of 2020 
 
Page 8 of 8 
 
5. 
Accordingly, on an overall consideration, we are 
convinced that the Impugned Order be set aside; and the instant 
appeal be allowed.  The NCDRC is directed to adjudicate the 
underlying application seeking condonation of delay in filing the 
WS in the Underlying Complaint on merits. 
6. 
The appeal is accordingly allowed. Pending application(s), 
if any, stand disposed of. No order as to cost(s).

1. 
These appeal(s) arise from (i) an order dated 22.08.2013 in 
Consumer Complaint No. 52 of 2013, wherein the National 
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred 
to as the “NCDRC”) forfeited the right of the Appellant 
Company to file its written statement on account of the Appellant 
Company’s lapse in conforming to statutory period prescribed for 
filing its written statement, under Section 13 of the Consumer 
Protection Act, 1986 (the “Act”); and (ii) an order dated 

C. A. Nos. 10941-10942 of 2013 
 
Page 2 of 9 
 
30.09.2013 wherein the NCDRC dismissed the Review 
Application bearing number 309 of 2013 filed against the 
aforementioned order dated 22.08.2013 (hereinafter (a) the order 
dated 22.08.2013; and (b) the order dated 30.09.2013, shall 
collectively be referred to as the “Impugned Order”). 
2. 
The facts and proceedings germane to the contextual 
understanding of the present lis are as follows:  
2.1. The Respondent filed a Consumer Complaint No. 52 of 
2013 before the NCDRC on 27.02.2013, vis-à-vis the 
repudiation of claim made on the strength of 4 (four) 
insurance policies availed from the Appellant 
Company. Pertinently, the underlying claim emanated 
from losses arising out of an incident of ‘sprouting of 
potatoes’ that took place at the factory of the 
Respondent (the “Underlying Complaint”).  
2.2. In this context, vide an order dated 08.03.2013, the 
NCDRC issued notice to the opposite party i.e., the 
Appellant Company herein, and directed it to file its 
written submission (“WS”) in response to the 
Underlying Complaint within 30 (thirty) days from the 
receipt of notice under Section 13 of the Act. 
2.3. Notice was received by the Appellant Company on 
19.03.2013; and accordingly, the Appellant Company 
ought to have filed its’ WS within a period of 30 (thirty) 

C. A. Nos. 10941-10942 of 2013 
 
Page 3 of 9 
 
days thereafter. However, the Appellant Company filed 
its WS together with an application seeking condonation 
of delay on 23.07.2013 before the NCDRC i.e., after a 
delay of 79 (seventy-nine) days beyond the 30 (thirty) 
day period granted to Appellant Company. 
2.4. Vide the Impugned Order, the NCDRC forfeited the 
right of the Appellant Company from filing its written 
statement on account of a contravention of the statutory 
period prescribed for filing such written statement, 
under Section 13 of the Act.  
2.5. Aggrieved by the aforesaid, the Appellant Company 
preferred the instant appeal under Section 23 of the Act.  
2.6. Vide an order dated 29.11.2013 this Court (i) admitted 
the underlying appeal(s) and took note of the difference 
of opinion inter se co-ordinate benches of this Court in 
J.J. Merchant (Dr) v. Shrinath Chaturvedi, (2002) 6 
SCC 635 and Kailash v. Nanhku, (2005) 4 SCC 480 vis-
à-vis limitation period for filing of a written statement 
under Section 13 of the Act; (ii) directed the Appellant 
to a sum of INR 45,00,000 (Indian Rupees Forty Five 
Lakh) i.e., the damage amount assessed by a surveyor 
under Section 64UM of the Act, towards the claim of the 
Respondent (the “Subject Amount”); and (iii) stayed 
the operation of the Impugned Order. 

C. A. Nos. 10941-10942 of 2013 
 
Page 4 of 9 
 
2.7. Accordingly, in compliance with the aforesaid order, the 
Appellant Company deposited the Subject Amount 
before the Registry of this Court. 
2.8. Thereafter, the instant appeal together with several 
similarly placed appeal(s) were placed for consideration 
before a Bench comprising of 3 Judges of this Court. 
The said Bench vide their decision in New India 
Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage 
(P) Ltd., (2015) 16 SCC 20 (hereinafter “New India 
Assurance 1”) held that the rigours of Section 13 of the 
Act were mandatory and accordingly, observed that the 
law laid down by this Court in J.J. Merchant (Supra) 
would prevail.  
2.9. Subsequently, a co-ordinate bench of this Court, noticed 
a conflict of opinion(s) in inter alia New India 
Assurance 1 (Supra) ; J.J. Merchant (Supra); Kailash 
(Supra); Salem Advocate Bar Association v. Union of 
India, (2005) 6 SCC 344; and Topline Shoes Limited v. 
Corporation Bank, (2002) 6 SCC 33, and accordingly, 
referred the matter to Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India 
for appropriate orders. In this context, vide an order 
dated 30.10.2017, the instant appeal came to be placed 
before a Constitution Bench of this Court, with a view 
to bring a sense of finality vis-à-vis the underlying legal 

C. A. Nos. 10941-10942 of 2013 
 
Page 5 of 9 
 
question vis-à-vis the manner of operation of Section 13 
of the Act (the “Constitution Bench”). Pertinently, the 
Constitution Bench vide its decision in New India 
Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage 
(P) Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 757 (hereinafter “New India 
Assurance 2”) categorically observed that the rigours of 
Section 13 of the Act needed to be complied with 
mandatorily; however, on account of various conflicting 
decision(s) of this Court, the Constitution Bench 
clarified that New India Assurance 2 (Supra) would 
operate prospectively. 
2.10. Pertinently, during the pendency of New India 
Assurance 2 (Supra), a Division Bench of this Court in 
Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mampee 
Timbers & Hardwares (P) Ltd., (2021) 3 SCC 673 held 
that the consumer fora were permitted to accept written 
statements beyond the stipulated maximum 45 (forty-
five) day period in an appropriate case on suitable terms. 
This position was followed by this Court pursuant to the 
New India Assurance 2 (Supra) in respect of 
application(s) seeking condonation of delay in filing the 
written statements/reply that either had been decided or 

C. A. Nos. 10941-10942 of 2013 
 
Page 6 of 9 
 
were pending prior to 04.03.2020 i.e., the date of 
pronouncement of New India Assurance 2 (Supra)1. 
2.11. Despite the aforesaid, a divergent view came to be taken 
by a Division Bench of this Court in Daddy's Builders 
(P) Ltd. v. Manisha Bhargava, (2021) 3 SCC 669 
observed as under:  
“7. As observed by the National Commission that 
despite sufficient time granted the written statement 
was not filed within the prescribed period of limitation. 
Therefore, the National Commission has considered the 
aspect of condonation of delay on merits also. In any 
case, in view of the earlier decision of this Court in J.J. 
Merchant [J.J. Merchant v. Shrinath Chaturvedi, 
(2002) 6 SCC 635] and the subsequent authoritative 
decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in New 
India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold 
Storage (P) Ltd. [New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli 
Multipurpose Cold Storage (P) Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 757 
: (2020) 3 SCC (Civ) 338] , Consumer Fora have no 
jurisdiction and/or power to accept the written 
statement beyond the period of 45 days, we see no 
reason to interfere with the impugned order [Daddy's 
Builders (P) Ltd. v. Manisha Bhargava, 2020 SCC 
OnLine NCDRC 697] passed by the learned National 
Commission.” 
 
2.12. In this context, a 3 Judge Bench of this Court in 
Diamond Exports v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd., 
(2022) 4 SCC 169 were tasked with inter alia 
reconciling and authoritatively settling the divergent 
views taken by this Court in respect of underlying

complaint(s) either pending or instituted prior to 
04.03.2020 i.e., the date of pronouncement of New 
India Assurance 2 (Supra). Thus, in this context, this 
Court in Diamond Exports (Supra) categorically held 
that Daddy's Builders (P) Ltd. (Supra) would not affect 
applications seeking condonation of delay that were 
pending or decided on or before 04.03.2020, and 
accordingly, such application(s) seeking condonation of

paragraph is reproduced as under:  
“24….Thus, the decision in Daddy's Builders [Daddy's 
Builders (P) Ltd. v. Manisha Bhargava, (2021) 3 SCC 
669 : (2021) 2 SCC (Civ) 319] would not affect 
applications that were pending or decided before 4-3-
2020. Such applications for condonation would be 
entitled to the benefit of the position in Mampee

We have expounded on the above principles in order to

3. 
Turning to the issue at hand, the undisputed fact(s) of the 
present lis reveal that the Impugned Order was passed by the 
NCDRC on 22.08.2013 i.e., prior to 04.03.2020 - the date of 
pronouncement of the decision in New India Assurance 2 
(Supra) by the Constitution Bench.  Accordingly, in this 

C. A. Nos. 10941-10942 of 2013 
 
Page 8 of 9 
 
background it was contended by the Appellant(s) that on account 
of the prospective operation of the said decision, coupled with 
the observations of this Court in Diamond Exports (Supra), the 
instant appeal ought to be allowed with a direction to the NCDRC 
to render a decision on merits qua the underlying application 
seeking condonation of delay in filing the WS. 
4. 
In the considered opinion of this Court, the categorical 
observation(s) of the Constitution Bench in New India 
Assurance 2 (Supra); coupled with the finding(s) of a Bench of 
3 Judges of this Court in Diamond Exports (Supra) have 
authoritatively brought quietus to the underlying issue. The 
application(s) seeking condonation of delay preferred before the 
consumer fora prior to 04.03.2020 i.e., the date of

5. 
Accordingly, on an overall consideration, we are 
convinced that the Impugned Order be set aside; and the instant 
appeal be allowed with the following directions(s):  
5.1. The NCDRC is directed to adjudicate the underlying 
application seeking condonation of delay in filing the WS 
in the Underlying Complaint on merits; and  
5.2. The Registry is directed to transmit the Subject Amount 
and all accrued interest thereon to the NCDRC, which in 
turn shall deposit the Subject Amount together with all

accrued interest in an interest-bearing fixed deposit 
account. The aforesaid amount shall remain deposited 
subject to the final outcome of the Underlying Complaint 
before the NCDRC.

The

are 
accordingly 
allowed.
