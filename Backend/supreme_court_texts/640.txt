PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J. 
1. 
These appeals are against the common judgment of the High 
Court of Andhra Pradesh dated 21.11.2019 dismissing the writ 
appeals filed by the appellant herein and upholding the order of 
the single judge of the High Court allowing the respondents’ writ 
petitions and quashing orders repatriating them to their parental 
zones. Relevant and necessary facts are as follows. 
2. 
The State of Telangana was formed under Section 3 of the 
Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 20141 comprises of territories 
mentioned therein, and by virtue of Section 4, remaining the 
territories constituted the State of Andhra Pradesh. The 
bifurcation of states came into effect on 02.06.2014 and this is 
declared to be the appointed date under the Act.  
2.1 Prior to bifurcation of the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh, 
the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRC)2 
functioned in the unified State of Andhra Pradesh. After state 
 
1 Hereinafter “the Act”.  
2 Hereinafter “APSRTC”.  

4 
 
reorganisation, the Corporation was bifurcated and the Telangana 
State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC)3, respondent no. 2 
herein, was formed w.e.f. 02.06.2015 (appointed date for the 
Corporations) to function in the State of Telangana, while APSRTC 
continued to function in the residual part of State of Andhra 
Pradesh.   
2.2 The respondents in these appeals were Class III and Class IV 
employees who were working as conductors, drivers and shramiks. 
They were appointed between 2014 to 2017 in districts, and more 
particularly zones carved out under the Presidential Order, read 
with Article 371D of the Constitution, that formed part of 
Telangana, which areas now fall within the State of Telangana. 
These respondents were temporarily deputed to zones which now 
form part of the bifurcated State of Andhra Pradesh. The orders of 
deputation were extended by way of several notifications issued 
from time to time, some deputations were made even after the 
bifurcation of the Corporations, pending finalisation of guidelines 
for permanent allocation of employees. We may mention at this 
very stage that the issue in these appeals is about validity of the 
repatriation orders that were passed by the appellant APSRTC, 
 
3 Hereinafter “TSRTC”.  

5 
 
relegating the respondents to the zones of their initial 
appointment.  
3. 
Returning to the chronology of facts, it needs to be noted that 
on 18.06.2015 the Government of India reconstituted the APSRTC 
Board of Directors with members from the central government, 
State of Andhra Pradesh, and State of Telangana to determine the 
permanent allocation of employees between the Corporations. On 
16.08.2017, the Board prepared a detailed Agenda Note, which 
was approved on 24.08.2017. The Agenda Note sets out the 
modalities for allocation of state cadre, zonal and regional cadre of 
employees of the Corporations.  
4. 
Before the finalisation of the Agenda Note, the appellant 
issued a notification dated 08.06.2017 repatriating employees who 
were on deputation, including the present respondents, to their 
parent cadres in TSRTC, i.e., to the zones in which they were 
initially appointed. The respondents challenged this notification 
and the consequent repatriation orders passed by Depot Managers 
by filing writ petitions before the High Court.  
5. 
The writ petitions were heard and allowed by the Single Judge 
by an order dated 10.11.2017 on the ground that, upon bifurcation 
of the two Corporations the guidelines for allocation of employees 

6 
 
between them had not been finalised. Thus, the single judge set 
aside the repatriation orders.  
6. 
The appellant filed the writ appeals and brought the Agenda 
Note dated 16.08.2017 and its approval dated 24.08.2017 to the 
notice of the division bench. Taking note of the guidelines for 
allocation formulated by both Corporations, the High Court passed 
an interim order dated 18.04.2018 suspending the order of the 
single judge and directing the respondents to report in their parent 
zones under the TSRTC, where they were initially appointed, as the 
guidelines for allocation of employees were jointly finalised by 
APSRTC and TSRTC. The matter was listed for further hearing on 
the issue of payment of salaries. The relevant portion of the order 
is extracted herein: 
“We are informed that the posts, with which we are 
concerned in this batch of cases, are not State level posts 
and the orders of repatriation, which were subjected to 
challenge, merely sought to send back the employees 
concerned who were on transfer in zones other than the 
zones in which they were appointed. As the posts were only 
zonal posts, the question of allocation of the employees 
occupying such posts between the two new States would 
not arise. 
 
We are also informed that the Andhra Pradesh State Road 
Transport Corporation (APSRTC) and the Telangana State 
Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) have come out with 
guidelines jointly with regard to the employees of the 
erstwhile APSRTC and allocation and apportionment of 
such employees. In the light of the order passed by the 
learned Judge setting aside the repatriation orders, the 
employees, who are on transfer in Zones 1 to 4 of Andhra 
Pradesh, though they were appointed either in Zone 5 or in 

7 
 
Zone 6 in the State of Telangana, are still working at the 
transferred location. This situation cannot be allowed to 
continue in the light of the subsequent guidelines formulated 
by both the Corporations. 
 
Sri N. Praveen Reddy, learned counsel appearing for the 
TSRTC, would inform this Court that his client is ready and 
willing to accept the employees sought to be repatriated by 
the present APSRTC. 
 
In that view of the matter, there shall be interim suspension 
as prayed for. The employees covered by the repatriated 
orders, the Respondents in these appeals, shall forthwith 
report in their parent zones under the TSRTC where they 
were appointed. The issue of payment of salaries to the 
Respondents-employees will be considered on the next date 
of hearing. 
 
Learned Advocate General for the State of Andhra Pradesh 
appearing for the APSRTC undertakes to use his good 
offices to see that the issue as to payment of salaries is 
resolved amicably. 
 
Post on 13.06.2018.” 
 
7. 
In continuation of the above-referred order, the High Court of 
Andhra Pradesh at Amaravati took up the writ appeals and passed 
the order impugned before us. This time, the High Court took a 
different view of the matter and directed permanent allocation of 
the respondents in their deputational posts falling in the State of 
Andhra Pradesh. The High Court also ruled on their seniority. In 
coming to this conclusion, the High Court drew an analogy with 
the 3rd proviso to Section 77(2) of the Act. It held that even though 
Section 77 applies to state government employees, an analogy 
must be adopted by the appellant for allocation of its own 

8 
 
employees. Hence, local, district, zonal, and multi-zonal cadre 
employees, even of corporations, will be deemed to be allotted to 
the successor state where they are serving on the appointed date. 
Since the respondents were posted and serving under the 
appellant on 02.06.2015, it was directed that they shall be deemed 
to be permanently allocated to the APSRTC in the zones where they 
were working.  
8. 
Mr. Gourab Banerji, learned senior counsel, appearing for the 
appellant has submitted that the High Court’s analogy with 
Section 77 is incorrect and that it has not taken note of Section 82 
of the Act or properly considered the guidelines framed by the 
Corporations for allocation of Class III and Class IV employees. He 
has taken us through the Agenda Note dated 16.08.2017, which 
provides that Class III and Class IV employees are recruited at a 
regional level and belong to the respective Corporation in which 
the region falls after bifurcation. Hence, the Board found that there 
is no necessity for formulating guidelines for the allotment of these 
employees between the two Corporations. He submits that this 
decision has not been challenged and is hence final. He has also 
submitted that pursuant to the interim order dated 18.04.2018, 
the respondents have already reported at their parent zones falling 

9 
 
under TSRTC. Sri Ruma Sarasani, learned counsel appearing for 
TSRTC, respondent no. 2 supports the appellant’s case.  
8.1 On the other hand, Mr. G.V.R. Choudary, learned counsel 
appearing for the respondents supports the impugned order and 
also submits that the approval of the Agenda Note dated 
24.08.2017 is only with respect to allocation of state-cadre 
employees, and does not extend to Class III and Class IV 
employees. Hence, the modalities for allocation have not been 
decided as required under Section 82.  
9. 
Having heard the parties, the issue before us if whether the 
High Court’s reliance on Section 77 is correct as it applies to state 
government employees, and whether it is Section 82 that governs 
the services of the respondents as it relates to employees of Public 
Sector Undertakings.  
10. In order to appreciate the rival contentions, it is necessary to 
consider Section 77 as well as Section 82 of the Act. Examination 
of the scope and ambit of these provisions sufficiently indicates the 
correct answer to the question arising for consideration. The 
provisions are extracted herein:  
“Section 77. Provisions relating to other services.— (1) 
Every person who immediately before the appointed day is 
serving on substantive basis in connection with the affairs of 

10 
 
the existing State of Andhra Pradesh shall, on and from that 
day provisionally continue to serve in connection with the 
affairs of the State of Andhra Pradesh unless he is required, 
by general or special order of the Central Government to serve 
provisionally in connection with the affairs of the State of 
Telangana:  
Provided that every direction under this sub-section issued 
after the expiry of a period of one year from the appointed 
day shall be issued with the consultation of the Governments 
of the successor States.  
(2) As soon as may be after the appointed day, the Central 
Government shall, by general or special order, determine the 
successor State to which every person referred to in sub-
section (1) shall be finally allotted for service, after 
consideration of option received by seeking option from the 
employees, and the date with effect from which such 
allotment shall take effect or be deemed to have taken effect:  
Provided that even after the allocation has been made, the 
Central Government may, in order to meet any deficiency in 
the service, depute officers of other State services from one 
successor State to the other:  
Provided further that as far as local, district, zonal and multi-
zonal cadres are concerned, the employees shall continue to 
serve, on or after the appointed day, in that cadre:  
Provided also that the employees of local, district, zonal and 
multi-zonal cadres which fall entirely in one of the successor 
States, shall be deemed to be allotted to that successor State:  
Provided also that if a particular zone or multi-zone falls in 
both the successor States, then the employees of such zonal 
or multi-zonal cadre shall be finally allotted to one or the other 
successor States in terms of the provisions of this sub-
section.  
(3) Every person who is finally allotted under the provisions 
of sub-section (2) to a successor State shall, if he is not 
already serving therein, be made available for serving in the 
successor State from such date as may be agreed upon 
between the Governments of the successor States or, in 
default of such agreement, as may be determined by the 
Central Government: Provided that the Central Government 
shall have the power to review any of its orders issued under 
this section. 
*** 
Section 82. Provision for employees of Public Sector 
Undertakings, etc.—On and from the appointed day, the 
employees of State Public Sector Undertakings, corporations 
and other autonomous bodies shall continue to function in 
such undertaking, corporation or autonomous bodies for a 
period of one year and during this period the corporate body 

11 
 
concerned shall determine the modalities for distributing the 
personnel between the two successor States.” 
  (emphasis supplied) 
 
11. From the text of these provisions, it is evident that Section 77 
applies to state government employees. Section 82 clearly states 
that the Corporations shall determine the modalities for 
distributing their employees between the successor states. 
Pursuant to this, the Board prepared the Agenda Note dated 
16.08.2017 that sets out the allocation of various kinds of 
employees between APSRTC and TSRTC. Upon going through the 
Agenda Note, we find that the Board has decided that Class III and 
Class IV employees, who are appointed at the regional level, are to 
be allocated to the Corporation in which the region falls after 
bifurcation. We are extracting the relevant portion here: 
“Regional Level Recruitments: The Class III and IV cadres 
like Drivers, Conductors, Mechanics, Artisans, etc., are 
recruited at Regional Level i.e., Revenue District wise. There 
are 12 regions in 13 revenue districts of residual AP state 
since 
Srikakulam 
and 
Vizianagaram 
districts 
are 
considered as North East Coast Region. There were 10 
districts in Telangana area prior to the appointed day i.e., 
on 02.06.2014. the seniority of these posts is also 
maintained at Regional level. The presidential order of 
making recruitment in the ratio of 80% of the posts to local 
district candidates and 20% to non (illegible) candidates is 
followed in such recruitments. Since the recruitments and 
seniority levels are at regional level, the distribution of these 
employees between two entities i.e., in 67,868 posts in 
residual APSRTC and 61,864 to TSRTC should not be an 
issue as they were recruited at Regional level (local cadre) 
and belong to the respective successor state/corporation in 

12 
 
which the region falls after bifurcation irrespective of their 
place of birth or domicile or schooling etc.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
12. There is no dispute about the fact that the respondents were 
recruited at the regional level and belong to the successor state 
Corporation in which the region falls.  
13. In this view of the matter, following the statutory mandate of 
Section 82 read with the Agenda Note dated 16.08.2017, the 
respondents will continue their employment in the same region, 
which is under the present TSRTC.  
14. The High Court has incorrectly relied on Section 77 of the Act 
and has in fact failed to notice Section 82 and the follow-up action 
taken thereunder. The High Court also ignored the correct 
enunciation of the applicable law in the order dated 18.04.2018, 
whereunder the respondents were directed to report at their 
parental zones as per the guidelines. As there is no dispute about 
the applicability of Section 82 even at the bar, the submission of 
Mr. G.V.R. Choudary that the modalities for allocation have not 
been decided cannot be accepted in light of the Agenda Note dated 
16.08.2017.  

13 
 
15. We have also gone through the prayer in the writ petition of 
Mr. V.V. Brahma Reddy (respondent no. 1 in Civil Appeal No. 
5267/2024), under which there is no challenge to the Agenda Note 
and its approval. The division bench of the High Court failed to 
note that the respondents who were on deputation were not 
absorbed in the deputed posts. In fact, their seniority is continued 
in their parental zones.  
16. The High Court also did not consider the subsequent 
development when the respondents were in fact repatriated to their 
parent cadre as a consequence of the order passed by the division 
bench on 18.04.2018. It is for this reason that this Court had, at 
the stage of admission, stayed the judgment of the division bench 
on 05.10.2020, which stay is continuing till date. The consequence 
is that the respondents have returned to this parent cadre in the 
State of Telangana. 
17. For the reasons as indicated hereinabove, the decision of the 
division bench is unsustainable. We therefore, allow Civil Appeal 
Nos. 5267, 5268, 5269, 5270, 5271, 5272, 5273, 5274, 5275, 
5276, 5277, 5278, 5279, 5280, 5281, 5282, 5283, 5284, 5285, 
5286, 5287, 5288, 5289, 5290 and 5291 of 2024 and set aside the 
judgment and order passed by the High Court in Writ Appeal Nos.
