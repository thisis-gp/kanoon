the High Court set aside an order dated 03.12.2018 passed by the 
Central Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench, Chandigarh 
(the “CAT”) and, accordingly (i) expunged the opinion of the 
Accepting Authority; and (ii) restored (a) the opinion of the 
Reviewing Authority; and (b) the grade awarded by the 
Reviewing Authority i.e., 9.92 qua Respondent No. 1’s 
performance appraisal report under the provisions of the All India 
Services (Performance Appraisal Report) Rules, 2007 (the “PAR 
Rules”) (the “Impugned Order”). 
 Factual Matrix 
3. 
On 07.06.2017, Respondent No. 1 i.e., an Indian 
Administrative Services (“IAS”) Officer belonging to the batch 
of 1991 and presently holding the rank of Principal Secretary, 
Government of Haryana, submitted his self-appraisal form qua 
the annual performance appraisal report envisaged under the PAR 
Rules for the period commencing 08.04.2016 up until 31.03.2017 
(the “PAR”). 
4. 
Thereafter on 08.06.2017, Respondent No. 1 came to be 
appraised by the Reporting Authority i.e., the Chief Secretary, 
Government of Haryana and, accordingly came to be awarded, 
inter alia, an overall grade of 8.22. Subsequently on 27.06.2017, 
a divergent view was taken by the Reviewing Authority i.e., the 
Health Minister of Haryana who upgraded Respondent No. 1’s 

SLP (C) No. 13972 of 2019  
 
Page 3 of 18 
 
overall grade to ‘9.92’. On 31.12.2017, the Accepting Authority 
i.e., the Chief Minister of Haryana rejected the aforesaid and 
downgraded Respondent No. 1’s overall grade to ‘9’ in the PAR. 
5. 
Aggrieved by the aforesaid, Respondent No. 1 made a 
representation under Rule 9(2) of the PAR Rules on 12.01.2018 
seeking, inter alia, the (i) quashing of the remarks and overall 
grading recorded by the Accepting Authority; and (ii) restoration 
of remarks and overall grading awarded by the Reviewing 
Authority (the “Underlying Representation”). 
6. 
Pursuant to the Underlying Representation, additional 
remark(s) were submitted by (i) the Reporting Authority on 
5.02.2018; and (ii) the Reviewing Authority on 12.02.2018, to the 
Accepting Authority for further action under Rule 9(7B) of the 
PAR Rules. Despite the aforesaid, no decision was taken by the 
Accepting Authority qua the Underlying Representation.  
7. 
Accordingly, aggrieved by the inaction vis-à-vis the 
Underlying Representation, Respondent No. 1 preferred an 
application bearing number O.A. No. 60/1058/2018 before the 
CAT seeking deletion of the remarks and overall grades recorded 
by the Accepting Authority; and restoration of the overall grades 
and remarks awarded by the Reviewing Authority in the PAR (the 
“OA”). Vide an order dated 03.12.2018, the CAT dismissed the 
OA relying upon Rule 5(1) of the PAR Rules read with Paragraph 

SLP (C) No. 13972 of 2019  
 
Page 4 of 18 
 
9.4 of Appendix -II of the ‘General Guidelines for Filing-Up the 
PAR Form for IAS Officers Except the Level of Secretary or 
Additional Secretary or Equivalent to the Government of India’ 
(the “Guidelines”) (the “CAT Order”). The operative 
paragraph(s) of the CAT Order are reproduced as under:  
“7. 
A co-joint reading of the aforementioned rule 
and guideline makes it clear that, they provide a 
window, by not having a barring clause on the 
Accepting Authority recording remarks beyond the 
prescribed time limit, and have actually set a date of 
31st December of the year in which the financial year 
ended as the time limit for recording PAR.  Thus, the 
limit fixed for writing the appraisal report by various 
authorities, in the Schedule 2, is the minimum or ideal 
period within which the remarks are required to be 
made.  Further, if the PAR is not recorded by 31st 
December of the yar in which the financial year ended, 
no remarks shall be recorded thereafter. We note that 
the for the financial year 2016-2017, the period under 
report challenged by the applicant, 31.12.2017 would 
be the ultimate time limit for recording PAR and the 
outer limit of time, beyond which no remarks can be 
made in the appraisal report. 
8. 
A perusal of Annexure A-1 reflects that the 
appraisal report of the applicant by the Accepting 
Authority was written on 31.12.2017 and was written 
well within the limit prescribed under the relevant Rule 
5(1) and guideline 9.4.  Applicant appears to have 
overlooked the applicability of these two rules while 
presenting his case to the Bench for expunging the 
remarks and over-all grade recorded by the Accepting 
Authority.” 

SLP (C) No. 13972 of 2019  
 
Page 5 of 18 
 
8. 
Subsequently, Respondent No. 1 preferred a writ petition 
before the High Court. Vide the Impugned Order, the High Court 
set-aside the CAT Order observing, inter alia, that (i) the 
Accepting Authority failed to appreciate the various practical 
constraints faced by Respondent No. 1 i.e., an upright, intelligent 
and honest officer, in the discharge of his duties; (ii) that the 
Reviewing Authority revised the Reporting Authority’s overall 
grading qua Respondent No. 1 in a transparent, fair and reasoned 
manner; and (iii) that the Underlying Representation had still not 
been decided by the Accepting Authority. Accordingly, in view 
of the aforesaid the overall grades and remarks awarded by the 
Reviewing Authority to Respondent No. 1 in the PAR came to be 
resorted by the High Court.  
Submissions 
9. 
Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on 
behalf of the Appellant submitted before this Court that the 
timelines prescribed under Rule 5(1) of the PAR Rules were met 
by the State of Haryana in respect of Respondent No. 1’s PAR. 
Accordingly, it was submitted that no prejudice was caused to 
Respondent No. 1 merely on account of a delay vis-à-vis the 
timelines prescribed under Schedule 2 of the Guidelines issued 
under the PAR Rules (the “Schedule”). In this regard, our 
attention was drawn to the performance appraisal report(s) of 
Respondent No.1 dated (i) 24.09.2015; (ii) 30.12.2016; and (iii) 

SLP (C) No. 13972 of 2019  
 
Page 6 of 18 
 
28.12.2018 whereunder no grievance was raised by Respondent 
No. 1, nor any allegation of prejudice was levelled against the 
Appellant. 
10. 
Further, Mr. Rohatgi drew the attention of this Court to 
Section V of the PAR. In this context, it was submitted that the 
Accepting Authority i.e., the Chief Minister of Haryana, knew 
the performance and achievement of all senior IAS officers 
serving the Government of Haryana; and accordingly revised the 
overall grades and remarks awarded to Respondent No. 1 in an 
impartial and objective manner. Additionally, Mr. Rohatgi 
submitted that the overall grade ‘9’ forms a part of the 
‘outstanding’ grade and is more than sufficient for the purposes 
of empanelment / promotion of Respondent No. 1. Thus, it is his 
submission that no prejudice could have been said to have been 
caused to Respondent No. 1 in the present case as he was awarded 
grades in consonance with a recommendation for empanelment / 
promotion.  
11. 
Finally, Mr. Rohatgi contended that the Underlying 
Representation is pending consideration before the Accepting 
Authority; and that the grievance of Respondent No. 1 would be 
considered by the Accepting Authority as per the procedure 
envisaged under the PAR Rules. In the aforementioned context, 

SLP (C) No. 13972 of 2019  
 
Page 7 of 18 
 
it was stressed that the High Court ought not to have interfered 
and set-aside the CAT Order vide the Impugned Order. 
12. 
On the other hand, Mr. Shreenath A. Khemka, Learned 
Counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent No. 1, submitted that 
the timelines prescribed under the Schedule are sacrosanct. 
Accordingly, it was submitted that upon the expiry of the 
timelines enumerated under the Schedule, the Accepting 
Authority could not have submitted revised the remarks and / or 
the overall grades awarded by the Reviewing Authority. 
13. 
Further, it was vehemently contended before us that the 
Accepting Authority had acted arbitrarily and without 
appreciating the material(s) on record, it proceeded to downgrade 
the overall grade awarded to Respondent No. 1 from ‘9.92’ to ‘9’. 
In this regard, it was contended that the Accepting Authority had 
acted in contravention of the principles enunciated by this Court 
in  Dev Dutt v. Union of India, (2008) 8 SCC 725. 
14. 
Lastly, Mr. Khemka submitted that prejudice has been 
caused to Respondent No. 1 on account of the non-decision qua 
the Underlying Representation under Rule 9(7B) of the PAR 
Rules; coupled with the fact that Respondent No. 1 is in the 
sunset of his service i.e., having a tenure of only 1 (one) year of 
service left before his superannuation. Accordingly, in the totality 

SLP (C) No. 13972 of 2019  
 
Page 8 of 18 
 
of circumstances, it was submitted that the Impugned Order 
ought not to be set-aside. 
Analysis 
15. 
We have heard the counsel(s) appearing on behalf of the 
parties and perused the material on record. There can be no 
controversy qua the factum that the timelines prescribed under 
the Schedule have been contravened. In this regard it would be 
pertinent to reproduce the key-timeline(s) prescribed under the 
PAR Rules vis-à-vis the dates of actual compliance by the 
relevant authority(ies):

16. 
Upon a perusal of the aforesaid, undoubtedly, and 
admittedly the Accepting Authority populated its remarks and 
awarded an overall grade on 31.12.2017 i.e., after a delay of 184 
(one hundred eighty-four) days. Accordingly, we must now 
consider the effect of a contravention of the timelines prescribed 
under the Schedule in view of Rule 5(1) of the PAR Rules. For 
ease of reference Rule 5(1) of the PAR Rules is reproduced as 
under:  
“Rule 5(1): Performance Appraisal Reports: - (1) A 
performance 
appraisal 
report 
assessing 
the 
performance, character, conduct and qualities of every 
member of the Service shall be written for each 
financial year or as may be specified by the 
Government in the Schedule 2. 
Provided that performance appraisal report may not be 
written in such cases as may be specified by the Central 
Government, by general or special order. 
Provided further that if a PAR relating to a financial 
year is not recorded by the 31st December of the year 
in which the financial year ended, no remarks shall be 
recorded thereafter.   And the officer may be assessed 
on the basis of the overall record and self-assessment 
for the year, if he has submitted his self-assessment on 
time.” 

SLP (C) No. 13972 of 2019  
 
Page 11 of 18 
 
17. 
At this juncture, it would be apposite to refer to a decision 
of this Court in Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) 
Ltd., (2003) 2 SCC 111 wherein this Court whilst weighing the 
consideration(s) qua the mandatory nature of timelines 
prescribed upon a public functionary observed as under:  
“42. We are not oblivious of the law that when a public 
functionary is required to do a certain thing within a 
specified time, the same is ordinarily directory but it is 
equally well settled that when consequence for inaction 
on the part of the statutory authorities within such 
specified time is expressly provided, it must be held to 
be imperative.” 
18. 
Furthermore, this Court in May George v. Tahsildar, 
(2010) 13 SCC 98 devised a test qua the mandatory nature of an 
obligation emanating from a provision of law. In this regard, this 
Court observed as under:  
“25. The law on this issue can be summarised to the 
effect that in order to declare a provision mandatory, 
the test to be applied is as to whether non-compliance 
with the provision could render the entire proceedings 
invalid or not. Whether the provision is mandatory or 
directory, depends upon the intent of the legislature and 
not upon the language for which the intent is clothed. 
The issue is to be examined having regard to the 
context, subject-matter and object of the statutory 
provisions in question. The Court may find out as to 
what would be the consequence which would flow from 
construing it in one way or the other and as to whether 
the statute provides for a contingency of the non-
compliance with the provisions and as to whether the 

SLP (C) No. 13972 of 2019  
 
Page 12 of 18 
 
non-compliance is visited by small penalty or serious 
consequence would flow therefrom and as to whether a 
particular interpretation would defeat or frustrate the 
legislation and if the provision is mandatory, the act 
done in breach thereof will be invalid.” 
19. 
In this context we must now consider the implication and 
/ or outcome (if any) of a contravention of the timeline(s) 
prescribed under the Schedule. A perusal of the PAR Rules would 
reveal that a contravention of the said timelines, neither render 
the underlying PAR invalid, nor would be met with any identified 
immediate consequence. The aforesaid interpretation is also 
supported by the empirical data i.e., previous performance 
appraisal report(s) of Respondent No. 1 which were admittedly 
beyond the timelines prescribed under the Schedule, however 
within the period prescribed under Rule 5(1) of the PAR Rules. 
Furthermore, even though the High Court vide the Impugned 
Order, set-aside the CAT Order, the High Court observed that the 
timelines prescribed under the Schedule were not water-tight and 
in fact, were flexible. 
20. 
Thus, we find ourselves unable to accept  the contention 
raised by Mr. Khemka i.e., that the Accepting Authority was 
either precluded from populating its comment(s) after the cut- off 
date as more particularly identified at Serial Number 5 in Table 1 
above; or that upon the expiry of the cut-off date, the Reviewing 

SLP (C) No. 13972 of 2019  
 
Page 13 of 18 
 
Authority’s comments would be deemed to have been adopted by 
the Accepting Authority.  
21. 
Admittedly, the Accepting Authority has met the timelines 
prescribed under Rule 5(1) of the PAR Rules and accordingly, in 
view of the compliance with mandatory timelines prescribed 
under the PAR Rules we find no reason to expunge the remarks 
and overall grades awarded to Respondent No. 1 by the 
Accepting Authority on the PAR on account of a contravention 
of the timelines prescribed under the Schedule.  
22. 
Now we turn our attention to the fulcrum of the dispute 
before this Court i.e., whether the High Court ought to have 
interfered with the CAT Order in exercise of its jurisdiction under 
Article 226 of the Constitution of India? 
23. 
At the outset we would like to deal with Respondent No. 
1’s reliance on Dev Dutt (Supra). The said case underscored the 
importance of, inter alia, communicating entries of evaluation to 
the candidate, irrespective of whether such evaluation was 
adverse in the eyes of the assessing entity i.e., the Court stressed 
the fact that  in matters of selection and promotion, a comparative 
lens must be adopted whereunder the adverse nature of an 
evaluation must be contingent not only on whether such 
evaluation would have an adverse impact on the candidate but 

SLP (C) No. 13972 of 2019  
 
Page 14 of 18 
 
also whether it would affect the candidates’ chances of promotion 
to the next category.  
24. 
In this context, although it was submitted by Mr. Khemka 
that prejudice has been caused to Respondent No. 1, we find 
ourselves unable to accept the said contention on account of the 
fact that Respondent No. 1 was awarded an overall grade ‘9’ 
which undisputedly forms a part of the ‘outstanding’ grade i.e., 
the highest category awarded to an IAS officer. Accordingly, in 
our opinion there can be no qualm that the said overall grade is 
more than sufficient for the purposes of empanelment / 
promotion vis-à-vis Respondent No. 1. Thus, the reliance placed 
on Dev Dutt (Supra) by Respondent No. 1 is misplaced in the 
present factual matrix.  
25. 
Now, turning to the issue framed in Paragraph 22 of this 
Judgement above, we find ourselves grappling with a 
foundational principle of our constitution i.e., that the judiciary 
must exercise restraint and avoid unnecessary intervention qua 
administrative decision(s) of the executive involving specialised 
expertise in the absence of any mala-fide and / or prejudice. In 
this regard it would be appropriate to refer to our decision in 
Caretel Infotech Ltd. v. Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd., 
(2019) 14 SCC 81 whereunder this Court observed as under:  

SLP (C) No. 13972 of 2019  
 
Page 15 of 18 
 
“38….It has been cautioned that Constitutional Courts 
are expected to exercise restraint in interfering with the 
administrative decision and ought not to substitute 
their view for that of the administrative authority. Mere 
disagreement with the decision-making process would 
not suffice.” 
26. 
Similarly, this Court in State of Jharkhand v. Linde India 
Ltd., (2022) 107 GSTR 381 whilst delineating the scope of 
interference of the High Court exercising jurisdiction under 
Article 226 of the Constitution of India vis-à-vis a finding of fact 
by experts observed as under:  
“7. As per the settled position of law, the High Court in 
exercise of powers under article 226 of the Constitution 
of India is not sitting as an appellate court against the 
findings recorded on appreciation of facts and the 
evidence on record. The High Court ought to have 
appreciated that there was a detailed inspection report 
by a six members committee who after detailed enquiry 
and inspection and considering the process of 
manufacture of steel specifically came to the 
conclusion that the work of oxygen is only of a "refining 
agent" and its main function is to reduce the carbon 
content as per the requirement. The said findings 
accepted by the assessing officer and confirmed up to 
the Joint Commissioner-revisional authority were not 
required to be interfered with by the High Court in 
exercise of powers under article 226 of the 
Constitution. The High Court lacks the expertise on 
deciding the disputed questions and more particularly 
the technical aspect which could have been left to the 
committee consisting of experts.” 

SLP (C) No. 13972 of 2019  
 
Page 16 of 18 
 
27. 
The overall grading and assessment of an IAS officer 
requires an in-depth understanding of various facets of an 
administrative functionary such as personality traits, tangible and 
quantifiable professional parameters which may include inter 
alia the competency and ability to execute projects; adaptability; 
problem-solving and decision-making skills; planning and 
implementation capabilities; and the skill to formulate and 
evaluate strategy. The aforesaid indicative parameters are 
typically then analysed by adopting a specialised evaluation 
matrix and thereafter, synthesised by a competent authority to 
award an overall grade to the candidate at the end of the appraisal 
/ evaluation. Accordingly, in our considered view, the process of 
evaluation of an IAS officer, more so a senior IAS officer entails 
a depth of expertise, rigorous and robust understanding of the 
evaluation matrix coupled with nuanced understanding of the 
proficiency required to be at the forefront of the bureaucracy. 
This administrative oversight ought to have been left to the 
executive on account of it possessing the requisite expertise and 
mandate for the said task.  
28. 
Accordingly, it is our opinion that the High Court entered 
into a specialised domain i.e., evaluating the competency of an 
IAS officer by way of contrasting and comparing the remarks and 
overall grades awarded to Respondent No. 1 by (i) the Reporting 
Authority; (ii) the Reviewing Authority; and (iii) the Accepting 

SLP (C) No. 13972 of 2019  
 
Page 17 of 18 
 
Authority, without the requisite domain expertise and 
administrative experience to conduct such an evaluation. The 
High Court ought not to have ventured into the said domain 
particularly when the Accepting Authority is yet to pronounce its 
decision qua the Underlying Representation.  
Conclusion  
29. 
Given this backdrop, we are of the opinion that the learned 
Division Bench of the High Court erred in law. Accordingly, we 
set aside the judgement of the Division Bench of the High Court. 
Additionally, as we have been informed that the Accepting 
Authority is yet to take a decision on the Underlying 
Representation, we direct the Accepting Authority to take a 
decision on the Underlying Representation under Rule 9(7B) of 
the PAR Rules within a period of 60 (sixty) days from the date of 
pronouncement of this Judgement. Thereafter, Respondent No. 1 
is granted liberty to take recourse to remedies as may be available 
under law. 
30. 
Before parting we must place on record our appreciation 
for Mr. Shreenath A. Khemka, Learned Counsel appearing on 
behalf of Respondent No. 1, for the spirited and able assistance 
rendered to the Court.
