                                VERSUS
ARVIND MANOHAR MAHAJAN & ORS.
RESPONDENT(S)

B.R. GAVAI, J.
1.
These  appeals  challenge  the  orders  passed  by  the
National  Green  Tribunal  (NGT)  dated  29.08.2022  and
22.11.2022.
2.
Vide the first order dated 29.08.2022 penalty is imposed
on  the  appellant  for  non-compliance  with  the  environment
requirement.   By  the  second  order  dated  22.11.2022,  the
review application has been rejected.
3.
Heard Shri A.N.S. Nadkarni, learned senior counsel for
the  appellant,  Shri  Feroze  Ahmad,  learned  counsel  for
Respondents  No.1  to  13  and  Shri  Mukesh  Verma,  learned
counsel for the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.
4.
Shri Nadkarni, learned senior counsel, submits that the
order  passed  by  the  learned  NGT  depicts  total  non-
application  of  mind.   It  is  submitted  that  though  the
reports of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) as
well  as  National  Environmental  Engineering  Research
Institute (NEERI) found that there are no non-compliances,

the  learned  NGT  records  to  the  contrary.   It  is  further
submitted that the methodology of imposing penalty of Rs.25
Crores  on  the  ground  that  the  operative  revenue  of  the
appellant ranges from 100 Crores to 500 Crores is totally
unknown to the canons of law.
5.
This  is  the  third  matter  today  in  which  we  are
considering  the  orders  passed  by  the  learned  NGT,  which
depicts total violation of principles of natural justice and
lack of due consideration.
6.
Learned NGT in its order in para 13 observed thus:-
“13.
It  is  patent  that  from  2010  till
atleast  2.10.2020,  the  unit  remained  non-
compliant.  We  have  already  referred  to  first
violation seen in the year 2010 and subsequent
reports of 2017, February 2018 and NEERI report
of June 2019 show that the violations continued.
Even  in  August  2020,  the  State  PCB  recorded
violations  and  the  PP  filed  undertaking  on
2.10.2020 to take further remedial action. Thus,
there could be no question of matter being beyond
limitation. Relief can be confined to five years
before filing of the application. Though status
after 2020 is not on record, the PP has to take
remedial action as well a" be held accountable
for past violations of ten years. There are rival
oral versions about current status - version of
the  applicants  that  violations  are  still
continuing and version of the PP that violations
have now been remedied.” 
7.
The  appellant  has  placed  on  record  reports  of  the
inspections  conducted  by  the  MPCB  for  the  period  between
2011 to 2020.  Not only that but under the orders of the
NEERI, which is a premier institution insofar as environment
sciences is concerned, has also found that the unit of the
2

appellant  was  compliant  with  environment  requirements  and
there was not a single non-compliance.
8.
In  the  light  of  these  findings  in  the  report,  the
observations of the learned NGT that the unit has been non-
compliant right from the year 2010 is totally untenable. The
further observations of the learned NGT that the report of
the  NEERI  of  June  2019  also  shows  that  the  violations
continues, is also contrary to the records.  The report of
the MPCB, which is placed at page No.349 of the paperbook
would reveal otherwise.
9.
Shri Verma, learned counsel appearing for the MPCB, also
submits that in view of the inspection reports of the MPCB,
he  was  not  in  a  position  to  counter  the  claim  of  the
appellant that there were no violation.
10.
We could have allowed the appeal on this short ground,
however,  the  further  part  of  the  order  i.e.  paragraph  15
makes an interesting reading.  The learned NGT held that the
appellant is liable to pay environmental damages. However,
while computing the said damages, the only methodology that
has  been  adopted  by  the  learned  NGT  is  that  as  per  the
information  which  is  available  in  the  public  domain  the
revenue range of the appellant is between 100 Crores to 500
Crores.  It is therefore found that the penalty of Rs.25
Crores would be commensurated with the revenue.  Firstly,
there  is  a  vast  difference  between  100  Crores  and  500
Crores.   Secondly,  if  the  learned  NGT  had  relied  on  the
information available in the public domain, then it would
3

not be difficult for it to come out with the exact figure.
In any case, the generation of revenue would have no nexus
with  the  amount  of  penalty  to  be  ascertained  for
environmental damages.  It is further to be noted that the
learned NGT found the appellant to be guilty of violations,
the least that was expected from the NGT is to give a notice
to the appellant before imposing such a heavy penalty.
11.
With deep anguish we have to say that the methodology
adopted by the learned NGT for imposing penalty is totally
unknown to the principles of law.  
12.
We are, therefore, inclined to quash and set aside the
impugned  judgments  and  orders  and  allow  these  appeals.
Ordered accordingly.
13.
Needless to state that in the event any person feels
that the appellant is engaged in any of the environmental
non-compliances, such a person would always be at liberty to
approach the appropriate forum and if such an issue comes
before  it,  the  forum  would  consider  and  decide  the  same
after following the principles of natural justice. 
14.
It  is  reported  that  Respondent  No.13  is  dead  and  an
application for substitution has been filed, which is lying
in  defect  for  want  of  death  certificate.  Considering  the
view that we have taken and since Respondent No.13 was one
of  the  applicants  along  with  the  12  other  applicants  who
have been duly noticed, we close the said application as no
orders are warranted.

15.
Any  other  pending  application(s)  shall  also  stand
disposed of.
