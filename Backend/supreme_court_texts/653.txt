“Disregarding a Court's order may seem bold, but the
shadows of its consequences are long and cold.”
1.
Contempt of court is a serious legal infraction that
strikes at the very soul of justice and the sanctity of legal
proceedings. It goes beyond from mere defiance of a Court’s
authority,  but  also  denotes  a  profound  challenge  to  the
principles that underpin the rule of law. At its core, it is a
profound  disavowal  of  the  respect  and  adherence  to  the

judicial  process,  posing a  concerning threat  to  integrity of
judicial system. When a party engages in contempt, it does
more than simply refusing to comply with a Court’s order. By
failing to adhere to judicial directives, a contemnor not only
disrespects the specific order, but also directly questions the
Court’s ability to uphold the rule of law. It erodes the public
confidence in the judicial system and it’s ability to deliver
justice impartially and effectively. Therefore, power to punish
for  Contempt  of  Court’s  order  is  vital  to  safeguard  the
authority and efficiency of the judicial system. By addressing
and  penalizing  contemptuous  conduct,  the  legal  system
reinforces its own legitimacy and ensures that judicial orders
and  proceedings  are  taken  seriously.  This  deterrent  effect
helps to maintain the rule of law and reinforces public’s faith
in  the  judicial  process,  ensuring  that  Courts  can  function
effectively without undue interference or disrespect. 
2.
Contempt powers are integral to maintaining the
sanctity  of  judicial  proceedings.  The  ability  to  address
contempt ensures that the authority of the court is respected
and that the administration of justice is not hampered by
willful disobedience. In the said context, the power of this
2

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
Court to punish for contempt is a cornerstone of its authority,
integral to the administration of justice and the maintenance
of its own dignity. Enshrined in Article 129 of the Constitution
of India, this power is essential for upholding the rule of law
and  ensuring  due  compliance  by  addressing  actions  that
undermine its authority, obstruct its proceedings, or diminish
the public trust and confidence in the judicial system. 
3.
The Courts ordinarily take lenient approach in a
case of some delay in compliance of the orders, unless the
same is deliberate and willful, on confronting the conduct of
the contemnor that strikes the very heart of judicial authority.
Undoubtedly, this appalling breach of legal decorum has in its
face  challenged  the  sanctity  of the  orders  passed  by  this
Court  and  hence  we  are  constrained  to  examine
Contemnor/tenant’s  willful  and  deliberate  act  of  non-
compliance of the order and also the undertaking furnished
by him as directed. 
4.
In  the  case  at  hand,  the  present
petitioner/landlord  (in  the  contempt  petitions)  filed  suits1
before the Court of Small Causes at Bombay (Bandra Branch)
1 R.A.E. & R. Suit Nos.43/137 & 111/300 of 2003
3

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
seeking eviction of the respondent/tenant (contemnor) from a
Shop No. 3 and Room No. 4 of the properties belonging to the
petitioner/landlord being Municipal House Nos. 427, 430 and
431 C.T.S. Nos. 38, 38/1 to 13 and T.P.S. Plot No.23 (part) of
Village Kanhari, Taluka Borivali B.S.D. situated at Corner of 9
Kasturba  Road,  Borivali  (East),  Mumbai  –  400066  on  the
ground of bona fide need and also due to non-payment of
rent and arrears against the respondent/tenant. 
4.1
The said suits were decreed by the Trial Court vide
Judgment dated 21.08.2015. Aggrieved against the same, the
respondent/tenant  preferred  appeals2 before  the  Appellate
Bench of the Court of Small Causes at Bandra, Mumbai. The
same were dismissed vide judgment dated 25.08.2022.  
4.2
Being
 
dissatisfied,
 
the
 
respondent/tenant
challenged the judgment and decree of the Appellate Court
before the High Court3 by filing Civil Revisions4, which were
dismissed vide order dated 12.10.2022. It appears that the
intention  of  the  respondent/tenant  was  to  prolong  the
litigation,  he  filed  review  petitions5,  which  were  also

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
dismissed by the High Court vide order dated 07.12.2022.  
4.3
As the litigation was not to end there only, the
respondent/tenant  challenged  the  aforesaid  common  order
passed by the High Court by filing the Special Leave Petitions6
before this Court.
4.4
When the matter was listed before this Court on
06.06.2023, the petitioner/landlord appeared on caveat.  After
hearing learned counsel for the respondent/tenant, this Court
did  not  find  any  merit  in  the  Special  Leave  Petitions  and
accordingly, the same were dismissed and granted nine (9)
months’  time  to  vacate  the  premises  subject  to  filing  of
undertaking  and  affidavit  by  tenant  before  this  Court.  Till
vacation  of  the  said  premises,  the  respondent/tenant  was
liable to pay charges for use and occupation equivalent to the
monthly rent. The order specifically mention that breach of
undertaking might give rise to contempt proceedings.
4.5
The  respondent/tenant  failed  to  furnish  the
undertaking as envisaged in the order passed by this Court
on 06.06.2023, and filed the Review Petitions7 which were
6 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 12081-12082 of 2023
7 Review Petitions arising out of R.P. Diary No.26984 of 2023
5

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
also dismissed by this Court on 07.02.2024.  
4.6
It  appears  that  contemnor  intended  to  retain
possession,  hence,  he  had  filed  applications  seeking
extension of time to vacate the premises, and only at that
time he furnished the undertaking/affidavit dated 22.02.2024.
Those applications were registered as M.A. Nos. 405-406 of
2024 & M.A. Nos. 407-408 of 2024, and were dismissed on
04.03.2024. This Court has not allowed extension of time as
prayed and the nine months period granted by this Court was
to expire on 06.03.2024. 
5.
The petitioner-landlord in this fact situation got a
notice8 issued to the respondent/tenant calling upon him to
hand over the physical possession of the suit premises on
06.03.2024  by  11:00  a.m.  and  vacate  the  same.  Yet  the
possession of the premises in dispute was not handed over,
therefore, the present contempt petitions were filed.
6. 
Upon issuing notice on 26.04.2024 returnable on
09.07.2024, it was directed that the alleged contemnor will
remain present in the Court.  On the date fixed, Mr. Chander
Prakash Mishra,  Advocate,  appeared  on his  behalf,  but he
8 Dated 04.03.2024
6

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
himself did not appear, though as per Office Report, service
on  respondent/tenant  was  not  complete.   The  counsel
representing  him  sought  two  weeks’  time  to  file  counter
affidavit on the pretext that the respondent is hospitalized. As
prayed time was allowed upto 29.07.2024 with direction to
contemnor to remain present in Court on the next date of
hearing.  
7.
The Office Report dated 27.07.2024 indicates that
the  counsel  who  had  put  appearance  on  behalf  of  the
respondent on 09.07.2024 had neither filed the vakalatanama
nor counter affidavit, therefore, while directing the physical
presence of contemnor, all the facts were noticed in detail in
the  proceedings  dated  29.07.2024.  Again  contemnor  had
neither  filed  the  counter  affidavit  nor  appeared  to  show
respect and comply the orders of this Court.  On the said
date,  new  counsel,  Mr.  Prakash  Kumar  Singh  had  put  in
appearance  on  his  behalf  and  said  that  Curative  Petitions
have been  filed,  which are pending  and  the contemnor  is
hospitalized.  He sought time. 
8.
Noticing all the above said facts and his conduct,
this Court was  prima-facie convinced that the respondent is
7

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
deliberately and willfully disobeying the orders, and despite
specific directions issued earlier, failed to appear in person.
Thus,  to  secure  his  attendance  bailable  warrant  for  his
presence on the next date i.e., 12.08.2024 was issued.
9.
As  per  the  proceedings  dated  12.08.2024,  it  is
clear  that  despite  service  of  bailable  warrant,
respondent/contemnor  neither  appeared  nor  filed  any
application  seeking  exemption  from  personal  appearance
clearly stating the reasons for his absence. In the said sequel
of events, this Court was constrained to issue non-bailable
warrant of arrest for securing his presence and for compliance
of the orders to vacate the suit premises, fixing the matter on
02.09.2024. As per office report, non-bailable warrant issued
could not be served on his address for the reason that the son
of contemnor who was found present at the shop and the wife
at  home  informed  the  police  officials  that  the
respondent/contemnor has gone to Delhi in connection with
the case.
10.
In
 
addition
 
the
 
conduct
 
of
 
the
respondent/contemnor  was  unveiled  by  his  earlier  counsel
Shri Prakash Kumar Singh present in Court on 02.09.2024,
8

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
who  informed  that  he  has  received  the  message  from
contemnor not to appear on his behalf and as stated by him,
it was recorded in the order. The order dated 02.09.2024 is
relevant to show his conduct, therefore, extracted below for
ready reference:
“5.
Shri Prakash Kumar Singh, Advocate on
Record,  who  was  appearing  on behalf of the
respondent-contemnor, has stated that he has
received  a  telephonic  call  on  his  Mobile  No.
9891223681  from  Mobile  No.  9146553252
supposed to be a mobile of contemnor or his
son  and  received  the  messages.  One  of  the
messages  regarding  his  disengagement  and
non-appearance on next date is reproduced as
under:
“To,
Mr. Prakash Singh Tomar.
From, Prithviraj Vardichand Jain.
Date: 01/09/2024
Sir, as I have informed you earlier that
you will not be appear in my matter, which
is listed on 2nd September, therefore I am
sending reminder to you that please don’t
appear in my case & I have appointed a
new Advocate for pursuing my case. So pls
take note for the same.”
6.
The  photocopy  of  the  said  scanned
9

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
message and other connected communications
have been placed on record of this file.
7.
We  request  learned  counsel  to  save
these  messages  in  his  mobile  number  in
original  form  and  may  not  be  deleted  until
further orders of this Court.
8.
Mr. Prakash Kumar Singh, Advocate on
Record,  in  view  of  the  said  message  seeks
discharge  from  appearing  in  the  matter.  We
discharge him from appearance but at present,
we are not disassociating from this case. 
9.
The  new  Advocate  on  Record  Mr.
Ashutosh Kumar Mishra, is not present in the
Court as informed by the learned counsel Mr.
Nityanand Singh now appearing for contemnor.
He  states  that  Mr.  Anil  Kumar,  son  of  the
contemnor, has visited to his office at Delhi and
met him. On his instructions, he has engaged
the AOR Mr. Ashutosh Kumar Mishra and now
he is appearing for the respondent-contemnor.
The son of contemnor has stated that his father
is bed ridden and not in a position to come and
appear in the Court. No application has been
filed on behalf of the contemnor indicating all
these facts seeking exemption and asking date
for  his  appearance  in  terms  of  the  previous
orders. 
10.
In  view  of  the  factual  scenario  as
10

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
indicated  hereinabove,  it  is  clear  that  the
contemnor and his son both are aware of the
proceedings  of  the  Court  and  watching  it
thoroughly. It is also clear that contemnor has
not come to Delhi and his son Anil came and
contacted  Mr.  Nityanand  Singh,  Advocate,  as
stated  before  us.  Therefore,  the  information
furnished to the ASI by his son Mr. Rajesh and
his wife Ms. Mangibai is incorrect and on the
basis of such incorrect information, service of
non-bailable  warrant  of  arrest  has  been
returned back to the Registrar of the Supreme
Court  only  by  the  Police  Inspector  without
supervising  it  by  the  Superintendent  of  the
Police/ACP of the concerned area.”
11.
In view of the above and for the reasons recorded,
fresh
 
non-bailable
 
warrant
 
was
 
issued
 
against
respondent/contemnor for securing his physical presence in
Court, clearly specifying that non execution of warrant may
cause appearance of Assistant Commissioner as well as the
Inspector of the police of the area.  
12.
Today,  when  the  matter  was  taken  up,  the
respondent/contemnor has been produced in custody by Mr.
Devidas  Sadashiv  Pokale,  Sub-Inspector  of  Mumbai  Police,
11

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
accompanied with Mr. Sumer Singh (D-5896) Sub-Inspector
and  Mr.  Akash  Yadav  (2426/DAP)  Head  Constable,  both  of
Delhi Police posted at Tihar Jail. On appearance of contemnor,
no doubt he appears to be a senior citizen, however, to gain
sympathy of the Court started shedding tears. He showcased
difficulty in standing, however, the Court offered him a chair
and a glass of water.  On being asked why he has not yet
complied the orders, it was submitted by him that he is a
poor person with large family to support, and apologised for
his conduct and later sought pardon. In the same breath he
said that the Curative Petitions filed by him are still pending,
and until those are decided, time may be granted.  Then, he
pleaded that, he has no other place to shift his large family
and requested to grant him at least one month time to vacate
the suit premises.  His newly engaged counsel also argued in
same line to grant time to hand over the possession of the
subject property.   
13.
From the above facts, on the cost of repetition, it is
necessary to observe that while dismissing the Special Leave
Petitions on 6.6.2023 being meritless, nine months’ time to
vacate  and  handover  the  peaceful  possession  of  the  suit
12

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
property was allowed.  The contemnor was required to furnish
an  undertaking  in  this  regard,  which  was  not  initially
submitted by him.  The contemnor continued to litigate and
filed Review Petitions, which were also dismissed on 7.2.2024.
Thereafter,  he  had  chosen  to  file  applications  seeking
extension of time of nine months to vacate the suit premises.
On dismissal  of said applications on 4.3.2024, the contemnor
has not vacated the suit premises though he was required to
do so on or before 6.3.2024.  Even after filing of Contempt
Petition and appearance of the advocate in the matter on his
behalf, peaceful possession was not delivered to the landlord.
On an endeavour made by this Court to call him for delivery
of peaceful possession as directed by this Court on 6.6.2023,
he  deliberately  did  not  appear  despite  specific  direction
issued at least three times for his personal appearance in the
Court.  On service of bailable warrant for his presence, he did
not appear on the date so fixed. On issuance of the non-
bailable  warrants  of  arrest,  he  and  his  family  members
mislead the police official on account of which the said non-
bailable  warrants  could  not  be  executed,  as  reflects  and
extracted above in the order dated 02.09.2024.  However,
13

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
when the second order was passed by this Court issuing fresh
non-bailable warrants, he was produced in the court.  The
contemnor  was  unable  to  explain  his  conduct,  as  noticed
above and made a request that time to vacate the premises
may be extended till decision of the Curative Petition.  
14.      It is needless to observe that the Curative Petition is to
be  decided  in  Chamber  and  the  said  recourse  is  not
permissible as a matter of right to the contemnor.  Later, he
sought  a month’s time to vacate the suit premises.  In our
view, after dismissal of the Special Leave Petitions, Review
Petitions and applications for extension of time to vacate the
suit  premises,  said  prayer  is  wholly  unreasonable  and  a
deliberate attempt to not to comply the directions issued by
this Court to which he furnished an undertaking at a later
stage.  It is to observe that on dismissal of Special Leave
Petitions  on  6.6.2023  and  lapse  of  nine  months’  time  on
6.3.2024,  possession  of  the  suit  premises  has  not  been
delivered to the petitioner landlord complying the order of
this Court.  From the date of expiry of time to hand over the
possession  i.e.,  6.3.2024,  six  months’  further  period  has
elapsed, even then compliance is not reported till today.
14

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
15.
Considering all the facts and attending circumstances
narrated above, we are of the view  that it is a case in which
the contemnor has deliberately and willfully not complied the
order  of this  Court  dated  6.6.2023  and  flouted  the  same.
Therefore,  we  are  constrained  to  hold  him  guilty  for  non-
compliance of the directions of this Court.  We also  find no
substance  in the explanation furnished by him, as discussed
above.
16.
Upon holding the contemnor guilty of the contempt of
order of this Court, we had granted  an opportunity to him
before we pass any order on sentence.  Again the contemnor
submits that being old aged person, having many illness and
to support a large family, he may be granted pardon and be
allowed a week time to vacate the suit premises.
17.
From  the  discussion  made  hereinabove,  we  were
reluctant to grant further time to vacate the suit premises,
but in the interest of justice, we grant a week’s time to hand
over the vacant and peaceful possession of the suit premises
to the petitioner-landlord, otherwise, we direct that the order
passed  by  this  Court  on  6.6.2023  shall  be  complied  with
taking forceful possession from him.              
15

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
18.
Accordingly,  we  dispose-of  these  petitions  with
following directions – 
18.1
The respondent/contemnor shall hand over vacant
possession of both the properties to M/s Sitaram Enterprises
as undertaken in furtherance to the order dated 06.06.2023
passed by this Court in SLP(C) Nos. 12081-12082/2023 (Diary
No.41124/2022)  and  SLP(C)  Nos.  12083-12084/2023  (Diary
No.41118/2022) within a period of seven days. 
18.2
In case of failure, within next seven days on a
warrant of possession issued by the 68th Judicial Magistrate,
First  Class,  Borivali  West,  Mumbai,  the  possession  of  the
properties in question shall be taken with the police help in
the  presence  of a  Court  Commissioner,  who  shall  prepare
inventory of the material lying in the premises and handover
the same to the respondent/contemnor against receipt.  Fee
of the Court Commissioner to be paid and the cost of police
help also shall be borne by the respondent/contemnor.  
18.3
Appropriate order in this regard shall be passed by
the said executing Court. After taking the possession from the
respondent/contemnor the same shall be handed over to the
16

CONMT.PET.(C) No. 196-197/2024 in SLP(C) No. 12081-12082/2023
petitioner/landlord and a report be sent to this Court. 
18.4
Considering  the  age  and  health  condition  of  the
contemnor, instead of sending him jail, he is sentenced till
rising of the Court and released as per the order passed in
the proceeding. It is further directed that amount spent by
the state exchequer in execution of the non-bailable warrants
and  to  produce  the  contemnor  before  this  Court  in  the
Contempt Petitions and in execution of Court order shall be
borne by  contemnor  and  recoverable against  him.     The
details  of  the  amount  spent  shall  be  informed  by  the
competent  authority  to  the  contemnor  and  the  executing
court within four weeks from today which shall be deposited
by the contemnor within four weeks thereafter.
19.
Pending application  if  any,  shall  also  stand
disposed-of.
