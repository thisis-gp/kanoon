Officer, Gorakhpur forfeiting the security amount 
of the Respondents. For the sake of convenience, 
we will refer to the parties as per their instant 
status before this Court.  
3. Brief facts of the matter are that the Forest 
Department had issued a public notice dated 
05.03.1998 inviting registered contractors for 
participation in a sale auction. In pursuance of 
the said notice, sale auction was completed on 
27.03.1998 as per prescribed procedure and the 
Respondents offered the highest bids in respect 
of the various lots. On being declared as the 
successful bidders, an agreement was executed 
between the Appellant and the Respondent on 
the same date with respect to the lot No. 195 (38-
H Nasirabad, Bankee Range). On the following 
day itself, a proposal was sent to the Conservator 
of Forests and Regional Director, Eastern Circle, 
Gorakhpur, U.P.  by the Divisional Forest Officer 
for approval of the auction proceedings. The said 
approval was granted by the Regional Director on 
14.05.1998. 
4. Post approval of the auction proceedings, the 
Divisional Forest Officer addressed a letter to the 

Civil Appeal No.   of 2024@SLP(C)No.22617/2011  
Page 3 of 11 
 
Respondent on 15.09.1998 calling upon him to 
deposit the bid amount of Rs. 2,92,000/- against 
the respective lots latest by 25.09.1998, obtain 
their work orders and conclude the work latest 
by 08.10.1998. It was further stated that in case, 
the work is not completed within the stipulated 
time as aforesaid, the security amount deposited 
with reference to the said auction shall be 
forfeited and auction proceedings shall be 
quashed. Even after the issuance of the aforesaid 
letter, the Respondents did not complete their 
work and accordingly, a public Notice dated 
26.10.1998 was issued by the Forest Department 
directing the Respondent once again to deposit 
the bid money and conclude the work. Another 
notice dated 23.04.1999 was issued to the 
Respondent stating that the entire work should 
be completed latest by 15.05.1999, failing which, 
the amount of security deposited shall be 
forfeited and the lots in question shall be put to 
fresh auction. Respondent failed to take action 
and accordingly on 17.01.2000, the Divisional 
Forest Officer issued a letter to the Respondent 
communicating that for non-compliance of the 

Civil Appeal No.   of 2024@SLP(C)No.22617/2011  
Page 4 of 11 
 
directions given to them, the security amount 
deposited by them is being forfeited and the lot is 
being put to re-auction. 
5. As 
mentioned 
at 
the 
outset 
earlier, 
the 
Respondents, 
being 
aggrieved 
by 
the 
communication dated 17.01.2000, filed the Writ 
Petition before the High Court praying for 
directions to the Appellants to refund the 
security amount deposited by the Respondent. 
Before the High Court, the Respondents argued 
that since the approval to the auction was not 
granted within the stipulated period, they had 
applied to withdraw from the auction and were 
not bound by the said offer made in the auction 
and accordingly, security amount could not have 
been forfeited. 
6. The agreements between the parties were 
executed in terms of conditions of sale of the 
various 
forest 
produce. 
There 
were 
two 
Conditions of Sale Manuals produced before the 
High Court. The first manual was published in 
the year 1980-81 and the second manual was 
published in the year 1987-88. The High Court, 
in its judgment, observed that there is cutting 

Civil Appeal No.   of 2024@SLP(C)No.22617/2011  
Page 5 of 11 
 
over the dates of both the manuals relating to 
application of the order mentioned therein. In the 
first manual, in place of year 1980-81, it has 
been cut and made enforced for 1997-98 and in 
the second manual, in place of 1987-88, it has 
been cut and made enforced for 1989-90. High 
Court also noted that the cuttings do not bear 
any signatures. 
7. The Respondents, for their argument of non-
forfeiture of security amount, relied heavily on 
sub-clause (viii) of Clause 10 of 1980-81 Terms 
& Conditions of Sale and Auction of Jungle Wood 
wherein it was provided that if the acceptance or 
rejection of sale of lots is not informed to the 
contractor after 40 days, then the contractor will 
not be bound to take the contract on the accepted 
bid. Whereas, the Appellants relied on the 
conditions contained in sub-clause (viii) of 
Clause 10 of 1987-88 Conditions of Sale, wherein 
it has been provided that if the approval of the 
concerned officer is not received within the 
stipulated period and if the competent authority 
approves the bid of the lot, then it will be deemed 
that the lot has been approved. 

Civil Appeal No.   of 2024@SLP(C)No.22617/2011

8. The High Court observed that the Respondents 
were relying on the conditions made applicable in 
1997-98 while the Appellants were relying on the 
conditions made applicable in 1989-90 and since 
the auction was held in the year 1998, the 
conditions applicable in the year 1997-98 will 
govern the sale by auction pursuant to which 
agreements have been executed. Accordingly, 
since the Respondents/contractors were not 
communicated about the approval or disapproval 
of sale of lots within 40 days, they were not 
bound by the said offer made in the said auction 
and could withdraw themselves. Thereby, it was 
held that the recovery sought to be made from 
the Respondents was illegal as being contrary to 
the Conditions of Sale contained in sub-clause 
(viii) of Clause 10 of the Terms & Conditions of 
Sale applicable in the year 1997-98. The Writ 
Petition was allowed by the High Court, setting 
aside the Appellant’s order dated 17.01.2000 and 
directing the Appellants to refund the forfeited 
amount. 
9. Aggrieved by the impugned order, the Appellants 
are before us. An interim stay of the impugned 

Civil Appeal No.   of 2024@SLP(C)No.22617/2011  
Page 7 of 11 
 
order of the High Court was granted by this Court 
vide order dated 08.08.2011. 
10. The case of the Appellants, largely, is that the 
relevant Manual operative in the Financial Year 
1997-98 is that on which the Financial Year 
1987-88 is printed. As per this Manual, the 
Clause 10 (viii) was amended and the condition 
of communicating the approval of the auction 
within 40 days was deleted. It was provided that 
if no communication regarding approval of the 
auction is received within the prescribed period, 
it shall be deemed that the approval of the lots 
had been accorded by the competent authority. 
In the absence of any Manual published after the 
year 1987-88, the said Manual with printed year 
1987-88, being the latest Edition, shall prevail 
over the earlier Edition of the Manual with 
printed year as 1980-81.  
11. Further, it was argued that the Respondents are 
bound by the terms and conditions as per 
Agreement dated 27.03.1998 executed by it with 
the Appellants immediately after the conclusion 
of the auction proceedings. In this regard, it was 
also highlighted that Condition No. 2-D of the 

Civil Appeal No.   of 2024@SLP(C)No.22617/2011  
Page 8 of 11 
 
said agreement clearly provides that if any 
purchaser fails to deposit the installments as 
agreed upon, the Forest Officer is entitled to 
cancel the auction and forfeit the amount of 
security deposited, amongst other things. 
12. Learned Addl. Advocate General appearing for 
the Appellants has also drawn the Court’s 
attention to sub-clause (vii) of Clause 10 of 1987-
88 Conditions of Sale wherein it is provided that 
if the buyer does not receive any information 
regarding acceptance of the contract within 35 
days from the date of auction, then he should 
contact 
the 
Deputy 
Conservator 
of 
Forests/Conservator 
of 
Forests 
and 
get 
information 
in 
this 
regard. 
The 
Forest 
Department will not bear any responsibility for 
not receiving timely information. 
13. We have heard learned Counsel for the parties 
and perused the relevant documents on record. 
14. We are unable to bring ourselves to agree with 
the observations made by the High Court. The 
High Court specifically noted that the cutting 
over the dates of both the manuals of Conditions 
of Sale do not bear any signature and yet, went 

Civil Appeal No.   of 2024@SLP(C)No.22617/2011  
Page 9 of 11 
 
ahead with considering the over-writing as valid 
and weighed the applicability of respective 
Manuals based on such over-writing. In the 
absence of signatures according any sanction to 
such over-writing, we believe that the High Court 
has seriously erred by making a finding that the 
Manual for Year 1980-81 will supersede the 
Manual for Year 1987-88 and will be applicable 
for an auction held in the year 1998. 
15. Since these are the only two Conditions of Sale 
Manuals produced before us as well as the High 
Court, we find force with the Appellants’ 
argument that in the absence of any Manual 
published after the year 1987-88, the said 
Manual with printed year 1987-88, being the 
latest Edition, shall prevail over the earlier 
Edition of the Manual and be applicable to the 
instant auction. 
16. The Manual of 1987-88 seems to have brought in 
amendments in the form of sub-clauses (vii) and 
(viii) of Clause 10, as mentioned above, which 
impose the responsibility on the contractor to 
enquire about the acceptance of the contract if 
no information is received within 35 days and 

Civil Appeal No.   of 2024@SLP(C)No.22617/2011  
Page 10 of 11 
 
also grants a deemed approval in cases where the 
approval is not received within the stipulated 
period. Once, it has been determined that the 
Manual of 1987-88 will be relevant for the instant 
case, it follows that the liability rested on the 
shoulders of the Respondents to enquire about 
the status of approval, and they could not have 
withdrawn from the auction after executing the 
agreement without bearing its consequences. 
The said consequences were clearly stated in 
Clause 2-D of the agreement dated 27.03.1998 
and include forfeiture of security amount.  
17. There is yet another relevant consideration that 
we have taken into account while reaching the 
final decision. It is the fact that in spite of 
repeated notices by the Appellants calling upon 
the Respondents to complete the work within a 
stipulated period, the Respondents failed to come 
forward and do the needful. Respondents came 
forward by filing a Writ Petition, only after the 
communication dated 17.01.2000 forfeiting the 
security amount. It reflects on the non-diligent 
and lackadaisical approach adopted by the 

Civil Appeal No.   of 2024@SLP(C)No.22617/2011  
Page 11 of 11 
 
Respondents which cannot be overlooked by this 
Court.   
18. We thus hold that the security amount deposited 
by the Respondents rightly deserves to be 
forfeited by the Appellants.  
19. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The impugned 
order dated 11.01.2011 is, hereby, set aside and 
the notice issued by the Appellants dated 
17.01.2000 is upheld as valid.  
20. Pending application(s), if any, is/are disposed of.
