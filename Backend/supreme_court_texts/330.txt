1. In this case, orders were reserved on 18.01.2024, 
leaving it open for the parties to move an appropriate 
application within two weeks, in case any settlement 
is arrived at. More than three months have passed; 
however, no such application has been filed. We are 
thus proceeding to decide the matter on its merits.

question. Under the leave and licence agreement, the 
property in question was given to the respondent.

respondent. Within six months of dispossession, the 
respondent filed a suit under Section 6 of the Specific 
Relief Act, 19631. The Trial Court decreed the suit 
after disbelieving the contentions raised by the 
appellants 
regarding 
voluntary 
handover 
of 
possession, relying upon a possession receipt. The 
appellant’s plea regarding the suit being not 
maintainable under Section 6 of the Act was also 
rejected. 
 
3. Aggrieved, the appellant preferred a revision before 
the High Court, which has since been dismissed by 
the impugned order. The High Court also found that 
the plea of maintainability of the suit raised by the 
appellant was without any merit and further 
concurred with the finding recorded by the Trial 
Court regarding the illegal dispossession of the 
respondent. 
 
4. Such concurrent findings, based upon the evidence 
on record and also being findings of fact, we do not 
find any merit in this appeal. The appeal is 
accordingly dismissed.
