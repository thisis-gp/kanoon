The appellant before this court has challenged the order
dated 19.05.2022  passed  by  the  High  Court of  Judicature  at
Allahabad, by which the petition filed by the appellant under
Article  227  of  the  Constitution  of  India  was  dismissed.  The
appellant had invoked the supervisory jurisdiction of the High
Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, against the
order  dated  28.03.2022  of  the  Additional  District  Judge,

Civil Judge (Jr. Division), Barabanki. 
3.
The dispute between the parties to this appeal relates to a
piece  of  land  situated  in  village  Gharsaniya,  Pargana  Dewa,
Tehsil-Nawabganj, District - Barabanki, which was sold by one
Kalawati  (Respondent  No.  4  herein)  to  one  Mansa  Ram
(Respondent  No.  5  herein),  vide  sale  deed  dated  30.03.2006.
Thereafter, the property was sold by Respondent No. 5 to the
appellant herein vide a registered sale deed dt. 13.04.2006. 
4.
On  22.04.2006,  Civil  Suit  for  permanent  injunction  and
cancellation of the sale deed dated 30.03.2006, was filed by the
Respondent  Nos.  1,  2  &  3  herein  before  the  Civil  Judge  (Jr.
Division), Barabanki. The appellant was impleaded as Defendant
No. 3 in the suit. It was contended before the Trial Court by
Respondent  Nos.  1,  2  &  3  that  Respondent  No.  4  had  no
transferrable right or title over the property when the sale deed
dated 30.03.2006 was executed in favour of Respondent No. 5
and thus, the property could not have been sold to Respondent
No. 5. Respondent Nos. 1, 2 & 3 asserted their claim over the
property  before  the  Trial  Court  stating  that  they  were  the
bhumidhar & joint owners of the suit property and were also in
2

possession of the same because the predecessor-in-interest of the
property was their uncle and he had executed a will deed dated
20.05.1997 in their favour. 
5.
After  service  of  notice,  vakalatnama  of  the  appellant’s
counsel  was  filed  on  22.04.2006.  During  the  course  of  the
hearing,  an  order  dated  06.09.2006  was  passed  by  the  trial
court, by  which the  suit was  to  proceed  ex-parte  against the
appellant. In the order dated 06.09.2006, it was recorded by the
Trial Court that a perusal of the record would indicate that the
appellant  was  duly  served,  but  he  did  not  file  any  written
statements, and thus, it would be appropriate to proceed ex-parte
against him. It is this order of the trial court, which was sought
to be recalled by the appellant by filing an application under
Order IX, Rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter
“CPC”). However, this application was filed by the appellant on
01.09.2017, i.e. after an inordinate delay of almost 11 years. To
explain the delay, the appellant argued that the summons and
notice of the case were not received by him and that the advocate
appointed by him belonged to another city, who did not pursue
the case diligently, and it was only in the year 2011, when he
inspected the case file that he came to know about the order
3

dated 06.09.2006. Even here as to why it took him another 6
years to file the application, as he had the knowledge in any case
in the year 2011, has not been explained. But this is not enough.
Even this application, filed in the year 2017, was admittedly not
pressed before the Trial Court by the appellant, for the reason
that correct facts were not mentioned in the application. Finally,
another application under Order IX, Rule 7 of the CPC came to
be filed yet again by the appellant on 23.11.2020.
6.
This second application filed by the appellant was dismissed
by the trial court vide order dated 07.10.2021. What weighed in
with the trial court, while dismissing the appellant’s application
under  Order  IX,  Rule  7  of  the  CPC,  was  the  fact  that  the
appellant  was  duly  served  and  had  filed  vakalatnama  of  his
counsel in April 2006 but did not file written statements in time
and on 12.07.2011 an application was filed by the appellant,
seeking permission to file the written statements. It was noted by
the Trial Court that the explanation tendered by the appellant for
the delay in filing the application under Order IX, Rule 7 of the
CPC  was  that  the  advocate  appointed  by  him  at  the  time  of
receiving summons, i.e., April 2006, did not pursue the matter
diligently and had defrauded the appellant.  Thus, the appellant
4

appointed another advocate, namely Shri R.D. Rastogi in May
2006. This explanation, as noted by the trial court, was based on
contradictory  statements  and  wrong  facts,  and  no  reasonable
cause was given for the delay caused.  Hence, it was dismissed.
7.
Aggrieved  by  order  dated  07.10.2021  by  which  his
application under Order IX, Rule 7 of the CPC for setting aside
the order dated 06.09.2006 was dismissed by the trial court, the
appellant  preferred  a  Revision,  which  came  before  Additional
District Judge, Barabanki (hereinafter referred to as “Revisional
Court”).  Vide  order  dated  28.03.2022,  the  revisional  court
dismissed the Civil Revision filed by the appellant. The revisional
court, upon examination of the material on record, found that the
first application under Order IX, Rule 7 of the CPC which was
filed by the appellant on 01.09.2017, was not pressed, owing to
the fact that initially he had appointed an advocate who did not
attend the case, and wrong facts were mentioned by a ‘junior
advocate’ in the first application. Hence, another advocate filed
the second application on 23.11.2020, mentioning the correct
facts. Yet, the signature on the first application filed in the year
2017 and on that of the second application filed in the year 2020
were of the same advocate, namely, Shri R.D. Rastogi. It was also
5

observed by the revisional court that although it was averred by
the appellant that he was  put in dark by the counsel earlier
engaged by him, there is no reference to his name. Thus, upon
consideration of the entire material on the record, it was held by
the revisional court that the application under Order IX, Rule 7
of the CPC for recalling order dated 06.09.2006 was filed by the
appellant not only after a long delay of 14 years, but also without
assigning  any  satisfactory  reasons  for  the  delay,  hence,  the
revisional court found no error in the order dated 07.10.2021 of
the trial court and accordingly, the Civil Revision preferred by the
appellant was dismissed.
8.
Assailing  the order of the revisional court, the appellant
filed a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India,
invoking  the  supervisory  jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court  of
Judicature at Allahabad.  The High Court, vide impugned order
dated 19.05.2022, affirmed the orders of both the courts below
and dismissed the petition filed by the appellant. The High Court,
while dismissing the said petition, took note of the fact that the
suit  was  filed  before  the  trial  court  in  the  2006,  by  the
respondent-plaintiffs and the appellant-defendant appeared and
filed the vakalatnama of his counsel on 22.04.2006 and in the
6

year  2011,  moved  an  application  seeking  permission  to  file
written  statements.  Upon  consideration  of  the  fact  that  the
appellant’s  counsel  remained  the  same  throughout,  the  High
Court was of the opinion that while filing the application in the
year 2011, the appellant’s counsel would definitely have come to
know about the order dated 06.09.2006, by which the trial court
had decided to proceed ex-parte against the appellant. Despite
this, the first application under Order IX, Rule 7 of the CPC was
moved only on 01.09.2017, which was also not pressed for 3
years, and then the second application was moved on 23.11.2020
without showing any “good cause”, as required under Order IX,
Rule 7 of the CPC. Thus, no perversity was found by the High
Court in the orders of both the courts below. The High Court
hence  refused  to  exercise  its  supervisory  jurisdiction  under
Article 227 of the Constitution, and in our opinion, rightly so.
In  this  case  the  main  question  is  of  delay.   Should  an
inordinate  delay,  which  has  no  reasonable  explanation  be
condoned?
9.
Whether an application filed by the appellant, under Order
IX, Rule 7 of the CPC can be allowed, after a delay of almost 14
7

years, is the only question before us. Was there a sufficient cause
for filing such a belated application? 
Although the term ‘sufficient cause’ has not been defined in
the  Limitation Act,  it  is  now  well-settled  through  a catena  of
decisions that the term has to be construed liberally and in order
to meet the ends of justice. The reason for giving the term a wide
and comprehensive meaning is quite simple. It is to ensure that
deserving and meritorious cases are not dismissed solely on the
ground of delay. 
10.
There is no gainsaying the fact that the discretionary power
of a court to condone delay must be exercised judiciously and it is
not  to  be  exercised  in  cases  where  there  is  gross  negligence
and/or want of due diligence on part of the litigant (See  Majji
Sannemma @ Sanyasirao v. Reddy Sridevi & Ors. (2021) 18
SCC 384). The discretion is also not supposed to be exercised in
the  absence  of  any  reasonable,  satisfactory  or  appropriate
explanation for the delay (See  P.K. Ramachandran v. State of
Kerala and Anr., (1997) 7 SCC 556). Thus, it is apparent that
the words ‘sufficient cause' in Section 5 of the Limitation Act can
only be given a liberal construction,  when no negligence,  nor
inaction, nor want of bona fide is imputable to the litigant (See
8

Basawaraj   and   Anr.   v.  Special Land Acquisition Officer.,
(2013) 14 SCC 81). The principles which are to be kept in mind
for  condonation  of  delay  were  succinctly  summarised  by  this
Court  in  Esha  Bhattacharjee  v. Managing  Committee  of
Raghunathpur Nafar Academy & Ors.,  (2013) 12 SCC 649,
and are reproduced as under:
“21.1.  (i)  There  should  be  a  liberal,  pragmatic,
justice-oriented,  non-pedantic  approach  while
dealing  with  an  application  for  condonation  of
delay, for the courts are not supposed to legalise
injustice but are obliged to remove injustice.
21.2.  (ii)  The  terms  “sufficient  cause”  should  be
understood in their proper spirit, philosophy and
purpose regard being  had to the fact  that  these
terms are basically elastic and are to be applied in
proper perspective to the obtaining fact-situation.
21.3. (iii) Substantial justice being paramount and
pivotal the technical considerations should not be
given undue and uncalled for emphasis.
21.4.  (iv)  No  presumption  can  be  attached  to
deliberate  causation  of  delay  but,  gross
negligence on the part of the counsel or litigant
is to be taken note of.
21.5. (v) Lack of bona fides imputable to a party
seeking  condonation  of  delay  is  a  significant
and relevant fact.
21.6. (vi) It is to be kept in mind that adherence to
strict  proof  should  not  affect  public  justice  and
cause  public  mischief  because  the  courts  are
required  to  be  vigilant  so  that  in  the  ultimate
eventuate there is no real failure of justice.
21.7. (vii) The concept of liberal approach has to
encapsulate  the  conception  of  reasonableness
and  it  cannot  be  allowed  a  totally  unfettered
free play.
9

21.8. (viii)  There  is  a  distinction  between
inordinate delay and a delay of short duration or
few days, for to the former doctrine of prejudice
is attracted whereas to the latter it may not be
attracted.  That  apart,  the  first  one  warrants
strict approach whereas the second calls for a
liberal delineation.
21.9. (ix) The conduct, behaviour and attitude of
a party relating to its inaction or negligence are
relevant factors to be taken into consideration.
It is so as the fundamental principle is that the
courts are required to weigh the scale of balance
of justice in respect of both parties and the said
principle cannot be given a total go by in the
name of liberal approach.
21.10. (x)  If  the  explanation  offered  is
concocted,  or  the  grounds  urged  in  the
application  are  fanciful,  the  courts  should  be
vigilant  not  to  expose  the  other  side
unnecessarily to face such a litigation.

(emphasis supplied)
Having perused the application under Order IX, Rule 7 of
the  CPC  dated  23.11.2020,  filed  by  the  appellant,  and  the
accompanying  affidavit,  wherein the  appellant had  sought the
benefit of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, for condonation of a
delay of almost 14 years, we find there was no satisfactory or
reasonable ground given by the appellant explaining the delay. We
say this for two reasons. First, it is an admitted position by the
appellant himself that upon an inspection of the case file in the
year 2011, he came to know about the order dated 06.09.2006,
by which the Trial Court had decided to proceed ex-parte against
10

him. What prevented the appellant from filing the application
under Order IX, Rule 7 that year itself has not been satisfactorily
explained at all, as the first application was only filed in the year
2017. Secondly, the explanation offered by the appellant, which is
that the advocate appointed by him did not pursue the matter
diligently, and then another advocate was appointed by him who
inadvertently forgot to file the application does not find support
from the records. What is clear is that the appellant has been
grossly negligent in pursuing the matter before the trial court.
Thus, the trial court, the revisional court as well as the High
Court,  were  correct  in  dismissing  the  belated  claim  of  the
appellant. We find no reason to interfere with the impugned order
dated 19.05.2022 of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. 
The appeal stands dismissed.
