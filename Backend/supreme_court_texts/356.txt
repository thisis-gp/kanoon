The case in hand is an example of a party suffering on 
account of total casualness in dealing with the matter. An avoidable 
litigation. 
2. 
 
The challenge is to the order1 passed by the High Court2 in 
Review Application3.  By the said order the Review Application filed by 
the respondents was allowed.  As a result, the earlier order4 passed by 
the High Court in revision5 was recalled.  By the said order, the revision

filed by the present appellants was allowed, permitting them to make 
good the deficit of ₹14/-. 
3. 
 
The facts as available on record are that part of land 
comprising of 1/4th share land in Khewat No.236 and Khatoni No.258 
situated in Village Samchana, District Rohtak, Haryana, was sold by Jai 
Singh, Jai Kishan, Randhir, Shamsher Singh sons of Balbir Singh son of 
Dariyav Singh to Sukhi Ram, Ram Pal, Hari Om, Mahabir Singh 
(respondents-defendants). 
The 
predecessor 
in-interest 
of 
the 
appellants filed a suit for pre-emption.  The same was decreed by the 
Trial Court on 11.08.1988.  The predecessor in-interest of the 
appellants/plaintiffs was required to deposit a sum of ₹ 9,214/- minus 
1/5th of the pre-emption amount already deposited, on or before 
10.10.1988, failing which the suit shall stand dismissed.   
3.1 
 
Predecessor 
in-interest of the appellants filed an 
application on 19.09.1988 along with Treasury Challan in triplicate, 
seeking permission to deposit the amount as directed by the Trial 
Court.  On the application the Trial Court passed the order for deposit 
of ₹ 7,600/-.  It was claimed that the application and the challans were 
handed over in original to the appellant(s).  The amount was deposited 
on the same day i.e. 19.09.1988.    

Page 3 of 17 
 
3.2 
 
On 06.12.1988, an application was moved by the judgment-
debtor (defendant-respondent) seeking permission to withdraw the 
amount deposited by the appellant-plaintiff on which a report was 
submitted by the office on the same day.  It was found that the amount 
deposited by the appellant-plaintiff was less by ₹ 14/-. 
3.3 
 
On 
23.02.1989 
the 
judgment-debtor 
(defendant-
respondent) filed an application seeking dismissal of the suit on 
account of non-compliance of the direction given in the judgment and 
decree of the Trial Court, as there was failure on behalf of the 
appellant-plaintiff to deposit full amount within the time granted by the 
Trial Court. While the aforesaid application was pending, the 
appellant-plaintiff filed an application on 05.03.1991 seeking 
permission of the court to deposit deficit amount of ₹ 14/-.  Subsequent 
to the filing of the aforesaid application, an application dated 
25.05.1991 was also filed by the appellant-plaintiff seeking 
condonation of delay in filing the application seeking permission to 
make good the deficiency in deposit of the amount as per the decree 
of the Trial Court. 
3.4 
 
Vide order dated 09.01.1992, the application filed by the 
appellant seeking permission to deposit ₹ 14/- was dismissed by the 
Trial Court.  Aggrieved against the same, the appellants preferred 

Page 4 of 17 
 
Revision Petition before the High Court which was initially allowed on 
04.12.2008.  However, on a Review Application filed by the 
respondents, the order passed by the High Court on 04.12.2008, was 
recalled and Civil Revision No.1645 of 1992 was dismissed vide order 
dated 26.10.2009.  It is the aforesaid order which is under challenge in 
the present appeal.   
4. 
 
Impugning the aforesaid order, the learned counsel for the 
appellants submitted that the appellants are illiterate.  In the case in 
hand, decree was passed in favour of the predecessor in-interest of the 
appellants on 11.08.1988 and the time was granted for deposit of the 
balance amount upto 10.10.1998 after reducing 1/5th of the amount 
already deposited in court.  Accordingly, an application was moved 
seeking permission of the court to deposit the balance amount.  On that 
application, order was passed by the court directing deposit of ₹ 
7,600/- and the Treasury Challan was also annexed with the 
application.  Immediately, the amount was deposited.  It was found that 
there was an error in the calculation of the amount.  As a result of which 
the deposit was short by ₹ 14/-.  It was not intentional but due to a 
calculation error. Appellants cannot be said to be at default as even the 
court also directed for deposit of ₹ 7,600/- instead of ₹ 7,614/-.   

Page 5 of 17 
 
4.1 
 
An application was filed by the judgment-debtor 
(respondent-defendant) for dismissal of the suit on account of the non-
deposit of the amount as per the decree within the time granted by the 
court. 
4.2 
 
The Trial Court, without appreciating the facts and 
circumstances of the case wrongly rejected the application moved by 
the appellant-plaintiff seeking permission of the Court to deposit the 
deficit amount of ₹ 14/-.  The aforesaid order was challenged before 
the High Court.  Initially, the Revision Petition was allowed vide order 
dated 04.12.2008.  However, in the Review Application filed by the 
respondent, the order passed in the Revision Petition was recalled and 
the same was dismissed vide order dated 26.10.2009.   
4.3 
 
The Trial Court as well as the High Court have failed to 
appreciate the issue that the court is empowered to extend the time for 
deposit of the amount in case there was any error.  In the case in hand 
there was a bona fide error.  The parties should not be made to suffer 
on account of any error in the judicial proceedings. The amount was 
too meagre. In support of the arguments, reliance was placed on the 

Page 6 of 17 
 
judgments of this Court in Johri Singh v. Sukh Pal Singh and Others6 
and Jang Singh v. Brij Lal and Others7. 
5. 
 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents 
submitted that the appellants having failed to comply with the terms of 
the decree passed in their favour, do not deserve any relief from this 
Court.  The appellant-plaintiff had purchased the property by paying 
the full market price.  A suit for pre-emption was filed by the appellant-
plaintiff which was decreed. The decreetal amount was to be deposited 
by 10.10.1988.  The appellant-plaintiff moved an application before the 
Trial Court along with pre-filled Treasury Challan seeking permission 
to deposit ₹ 7,600/-.  It was on that application moved by the appellant-
plaintiff, the court ordered for depositing of ₹ 7,600/-, which was 
deposited by the appellant-plaintiff.  The amount as such was not 
calculated by the court as it was the duty of the appellant-plaintiff to 
deposit the correct amount in terms of the decree, which was explicit.   
5.1 
 
On an application moved by the respondent-defendant for 
withdrawal of the amount of ₹ 9,214/- in terms of the decree, the office 
reported on 06.12.1988 that the amount deposited was merely                     
₹ 9,200/-. Immediately, thereafter an application was filed on 
 
6 (1989) 4 SCC 403 : 1989 INSC 265 
7 (1964) 2 SCR 145 : AIR 1966 SC 1631: 1963 INSC 42 

Page 7 of 17 
 
23.02.1989 by the respondent-defendant for dismissal of the suit on 
account of the non-compliance of the terms of the decree by the 
appellant-plaintiff.  More than two years thereafter, the appellant-
plaintiff moved an application seeking permission to deposit the 
balance amount of ₹ 14/- without explaining any reason for moving 
such an application at a belated stage.  More than two months 
thereafter, an application was filed seeking condonation of delay in 
deposit of the amount.  Even that also did not contain any reason.   
5.2 
 
Vide order dated 09.01.1992, the Trial Court dismissed the 
application filed by the appellant-plaintiff seeking leave to deposit         
₹ 14/- on account of non-deposit of the whole amount within the time 
permitted.  The order passed by the Trial Court was challenged by the 
appellants before the High Court.  Initially, on a wrong premise the 
High Court allowed the revision petition and set aside the order of the 
Trial Court.  However, there being error apparent on the record, the 
Review Application filed by the respondents was allowed and after 
recalling the earlier order passed in the Revision Petition, the High 
Court dismissed the same.   
5.3 
 
There is no error in the order passed by the High Court.  
Even if the time granted by the court for deposit of the amount can be 
extended but there has to be sufficient reason for the same.  In the case 

Page 8 of 17 
 
in hand, there is no reason, what to talk about sufficient reason.  There 
was no fault of the Trial Court as the order for deposit was passed on 
the same line as was prayed for by the appellants.  
6. 
 
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused 
the paper book.      
 
 
   
7. 
 
The respondents purchased the property in dispute from Jai 
Singh, Jai Kishan, Randhir and Shamsher Singh sons of Balbir Singh son 
of Dariyav Singh vide registered sale deed dated 06.08.1985. The 
appellants filed a suit for possession by way of preemption claiming 
that they being the co-sharers in the Joint Khewat had preferential right 
to purchase the property. The suit was filed on 11.08.1986.  The suit was 
decreed on 11.08.1988. The appellants were directed to deposit a sum 
of ₹ 9,214/- minus 1/5th preemption amount already deposited, on or 
before 10.10.1988 failing which the suit was to be dismissed with costs. 
8. 
 
The appellants moved an application dated 19.09.1988 
before the court seeking permission to deposit the sum due as per the 
direction of the court. It was specifically mentioned in the application 
that as per the decree the appellants were required to deposit a sum of 
₹ 9,214/- less 1/5th already deposited along with the application. 
Treasury Challan was also annexed mentioning the amount to be 

Page 9 of 17 
 
deposited by the appellants, i.e. ₹ 7,600/-. The court vide endorsement 
in the application itself on 19.09.1988 permitted the appellants to 
deposit ₹ 7,600/-. The amount was deposited by the appellants in the 
bank on the same day. 
9. 
 
The respondents moved an application seeking permission 
to withdraw the amount deposited by the appellants in terms of the 
decree. The report dt. 06.12.1988 was submitted by the registry, that 
initially a sum of ₹ 1,600/- was deposited by the appellants on 
09.09.1986 and subsequently after passing of a decree a sum of ₹ 
7,600/- was deposited on 19.09.1988. Immediately thereafter the 
respondents moved an application dated 23.02.1989 before the court 
for passing further order and for dismissal of the suit as the appellants 
had failed to comply with the terms of the decree. The same was 
directed to be put up on 20.03.1989, 07.04.1989, 19.04.1989 and 
thereafter on 26.04.1989 for consideration. From the record, nothing is 
available as to what happened to this aforesaid application after the 
aforesaid date. Nothing is clearly evident regarding that from the 
records. 
10. 
 
Thereafter, at page 75 of the original record, there is 
another application filed by the respondents with similar prayer. It was 
directed by the court vide order dated 23.04.1990 to be put up on 

Page 10 of 17 
 
25.04.1990, then on 30.04.1990. On that date, notice was directed to be 
issued to the other side for 12.05.1990. On the next date, the learned 
counsel appearing for the non-applicant/appellants sought time to file 
reply to the application. After seeking adjournment, reply was filed on 
02.06.1990 taking the stand that the remaining amount was deposited 
after obtaining prior permission of the court and whatever direction 
was issued by the court the same was complied with. It was stated that 
whatever amount was payable was deposited, however, if there is any 
deficiency the appellants are ready to make the same good. 
11. 
 
After filing of reply by the appellants the matter remained 
under consideration before the court. 
12. 
 
On 05.03.1991, the appellants filed an application before 
the court seeking permission to deposit the balance sum of ₹ 14/- in 
which notice was issued to the other side for 23.03.1991. While the 
aforesaid application was pending, another application was filed by 
the appellants on 25.05.1991 seeking condonation of delay in 
depositing of ₹ 14/-.  It was pleaded in the application that ₹ 14/- 
remained unpaid due to clerical mistake. The mistake was not 
intentional. Hence, delay be condoned. 

Page 11 of 17 
 
13. 
 
Finally, the application was taken up for consideration by 
the court and vide order dated 09.01.1992 the same was rejected. 
14. 
 
Against the aforesaid order, the appellants preferred 
Revision Petition before the High Court, which was initially allowed 
vide order dated 04.12.2008. The High Court noticed the argument 
raised by learned counsel for the respondents therein namely the 
respondents herein that in preemption matter the court cannot extend 
the time for deposit of money. However, the Court went on to invoke 
its inherent jurisdiction for correction of error of the court. The revision 
was allowed. The appellants were granted time to deposit the balance 
sum of ₹ 14/-. The respondents filed the Review Application against the 
order of the High Court. The same was allowed and vide impugned 
order dated 26.10.2009, the earlier order passed by the High Court on 
04.12.2008 was recalled and the revision was dismissed. 
15. 
 
 As far as the position of law and the question whether the 
court can extend the time for deposit of money in a pre-emption suit is 
concerned, this court in Johri Singh’s case (supra) considered a 
similar issue. In that case, the deposit was less by ₹ 100/-. The 
application filed by the decree holder therein seeking permission to 
deposit to make the deficiency good, after expiry of the time granted 
by the court, was allowed. The order was upheld by this court. In para 

Page 12 of 17 
 
21, this court opined that the Trial Court in the decree only mentioned 
a sum to be deposited by the decree holder minus the amount of “zare-
panjum”. The amount was not specified in the judgment. Error in 
calculation occurred, as a result of which ₹ 100/- was deposited less. 
The application filed by the decree holder therein with challan 
annexed was allowed by the court without pointing out the error. After 
deposit of the amount though little deficient, even the possession of the 
property was delivered to the decree-holder. Relevant paras 20, 21, 25 
and 26 are extracted below: 
“20.  
In the third category of cases, namely, non-
deposit of only a relatively small fraction of the purchase 
money due to inadvertent mistake whether or not caused 
by any action of the court, the court has the discretion 
under Section 148 CPC to extend the time even though 
the time fixed has already expired provided it is satisfied 
that the mistake is bona fide and was not indicative of 
negligence or inaction as was the case in Jogdhayan 
[(1983) 1 SCC 26 : (1983) 1 SCR 844] . The court will 
extend the time when it finds that the mistake was the 
result of, or induced by, an action of the court applying 
the maxim “actus curiae neminem gravabit” — an act of 

Page 13 of 17 
 
the court shall prejudice no man, as was the case in Jang 
Singh [AIR 1966 SC 1631 : (1964) 2 SCR 145] . While it 
would be necessary to consider the facts of the case to 
determine whether the inadvertent mistake was due to 
any action of the court it would be appropriate to find that 
the ultimate permission to deposit the challaned amount 
is that of the court. 
21.  
Proceeding as above, in the instant case we find 
that the decree did not quantify the purchase money 
having only said “Rs 41,082 less the amount of ‘zare 
panjum’ ”. Of course, ‘certum est quod certum reddi 
potest’— that is certain which can be rendered certain. 
The amount of ‘zare-panjum’ was not specified. Parties do 
not controvert that it was one fifth. But the amount was not 
calculated by the court itself. Inadvertent error crept in 
arithmetical calculation. The deficit of Rs 100 was a very 
small fraction of the total payable amount of Rs 33,682 
which was paid very much within the fixed time, and there 
was no reason, except for the mistake, as to why he would 
not have paid this Rs 100 also within time. The appellants' 
application with the challan annexed was allowed by 

Page 14 of 17 
 
court officials without pointing out the mistake. The 
amount was deposited and even possession of the 
property was delivered to the appellant. The Senior 
Subordinate Judge allowed the application made by 
appellant in exercise of the discretion vested in him 
apparently on the view that sufficient cause had been out 
for non-deposit of Rs 100. This order, however, as seen 
above, was set aside by the High Court in a civil revision 
under Section 115 CPC. 
 
 
 
xx 
 
 
xx 
 
 
xx 
25.   
In this view of the matter there seems to be no 
manner of doubt that the Senior Subordinate Judge had 
jurisdiction to extend the time under Section 148 CPC on 
sufficient cause being made out. The first condition 
precedent to enable the High Court to exercise its 
revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 CPC was, 
therefore, lacking. Likewise, nothing has been brought to 
our notice on the basis of which it could be said that the 
discretion exercised by the Senior Subordinate Judge 
was in breach of any provision of law or that he committed 
any error of procedure which was material and may have 

Page 15 of 17 
 
affected the ultimate decision. That being so, the High 
Court had no power to interfere with the order of the 
Senior Subordinate Judge, however profoundly it may 
have differed from the conclusions of that Judge on 
questions of fact or law. 
26.   
On the facts and circumstances of the case we 
feel justified in allowing this appeal, setting aside the 
impugned judgment of the High Court, and in restoring 
that of the Senior Subordinate Judge allowing 10 days' 
time to deposit the balance of Rs 100 exercising power 
under Section 148 CPC on facts of the case. If the amount 
has not already been deposited, it shall be deposited 
within 30 days from today and the respondents shall 
withdraw the same according to law. The appeal is 
accordingly 
allowed, 
but 
under 
the 
facts 
and 
circumstances of the case, without any order as to costs.” 
16. 
 
The facts of the case in hand are identical. In the instant case 
as well the balance amount to be deposited by the appellant was not 
specified in the decree. The deficiency was only ₹ 14/-. The appellants 
had already deposited ₹ 9,200/- including the preemption amount 
already deposited. When the application was filed seeking permission 

Page 16 of 17 
 
to deposit the amount along with the Treasury Challan, the error was 
not noticed by the Court. At the very first stage, in response to the 
application filed by the respondents to pass appropriate order on 
account of deficiency by the appellants to deposit the amount as 
directed by the court, the appellants stated that in case there is any 
deficiency, they are ready to make it good. The court could have 
considered the same and passed appropriate orders. However, the 
matter remained pending for this. 
17. 
 
It is the pleaded case of the appellants in the application 
filed for permission to deposit the deficit balance of ₹ 14/- dated 
05.03.1991, that the applicant (late Kanihya, predecessor in-interest of 
the appellants) is in possession of the property and mutation has 
already been entered in his name in the revenue record. 
18. 
 
In view of the aforesaid discussions, the present appeal 
deserves to be allowed. Ordered accordingly. The impugned order 
passed by the High Court and the court below are set aside. The 
appellants are permitted to deposit a sum of ₹ 14/- to the court below 
on or before 20.05.2024. The respondents shall be entitled to withdraw 
the entire amount deposited in court, if not already done. 

Page 17 of 17 
 
19. 
 
Though, we are allowing the appeal but on account of error 
on part of the appellants, the respondents were made to litigate for 
decades together upto this Court. We deem it appropriate to 
compensate them. Hence, we direct the appellants to pay a cost of ₹ 
1,00,000/- to the respondents. The amount shall be deposited in the 
Trial Court within the time granted above, with liberty to the 
respondents to withdraw the same.
