the petition filed by the present appellants for quashing of 
criminal proceedings came to be disposed of by permitting the 
appellants to urge all the pleas raised in the said petition before 
the trial Court at the appropriate stage.  The appellants had 
approached the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC” for short) praying for quashing 
of the criminal proceedings in T.R. No. 28 of 2002 pending in the 
Court of Special Judge (CBI) Bhubaneswar (“trial Court” for 
short).  
3. 
Shorn of details, the case of the prosecution is as given 
below.  
3.1 On 14th October 2000, on the basis of information received 
from a reliable source, the Inspector of Police CBI/SPE 
Bhubaneswar registered a regular case under Section 154 
of CrPC being Crime No. RCBHU 2000A0021 (“FIR” for 
short) against five persons namely, Ajay Kumar Behera 
(Accused No. 1), Surjit Sen (Accused No. 2), Kaushik Nath 
Ojha (Accused No.3), Tarini Sen (Accused No. 4), 
Shaileshree Sen (Accused No. 5) alleging commission of 

3 
offences punishable under Sections 120-B, 420, 468 and 
471 of Indian Penal Code 1860 (“IPC” for short) & Sections 
13(2) read with 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 
1988 (“PC Act” for short). The present appellants are 
Accused No. 4 and 5.  
3.2 It was alleged in the F.I.R. that Ajay Kumar Behera while 
being posted as the Branch Manager in Allahabad Bank, 
Temple Marg Branch, Bhubaneswar (“the Bank” for short) 
during the year 1998-1999 entered into a criminal 
conspiracy with the other accused persons. At that time, 
Surjit Sen and Kaushik Nath Ojha were the Directors of 
M/s Indo Global Projects Ltd., Bhubaneswar (“IGPL” for 
short) and the appellants herein were Partners in M/s 
Clarion Travels, Bhubaneswar (“Clarion Travels” for short).  
3.3 It was also alleged in the F.I.R. that on 20th November 1998, 
a loan application was submitted on behalf of Clarion 
Travels for the purpose of securing funds to purchase new 
cars. The loan application was signed by the present 
appellants on behalf of Clarion Travels. Against the said 

4 
loan application, on 17th December 1998, Ajay Kumar 
Behera sanctioned a loan of Rs. 8,40,000/- without keeping 
any security or post-dated cheques. No repayment was ever 
made, and Ajay Kumar Behera did not pursue the same. 
3.4 It was also alleged in the F.I.R. that earlier in time, on 22nd 
August 1998, a similar loan application was submitted on 
behalf of IGPL for the same purpose of securing funds to 
purchase new cars at a cost of Rs. 11,84,600/-. Against the 
said loan application, on 24th August 1998, Ajay Kumar 
Behera sanctioned the loan for the said amount. The money 
was received by Accused No. 3 and 4, who were Directors of 
IGPL. In furtherance of the loan application, the Accused 
No. 3 and 4 had also deposited 36 post-dated cheques, 
which when they were sent for clearing, at a later stage, by 
the successor of Ajay Kumar Behera bounced. 
3.5 It was also alleged in the F.I.R. that, the office address 
disclosed by both IGPL and Clarion Travels was one and the 
same, i.e., 168/169-A, Bapuji Nagar, Bhubaneswar. In case 
of IGPL, it was also alleged that the firm Indo Global Motor 

5 
from where the cars were purportedly purchased by IGPL is 
in fact shown as a unit of IGPL and that both of them share 
one and the same address being 56-A, Mancheswar 
Industrial Estate, Bhubaneswar. Similarly, in the case of 
Clarion Travels, it was also alleged that the firm M/s 
Kalinga Auto Centre Ltd. from where the cars were 
purportedly purchased by Clarion Travels also has the 
same address 56-A, Mancheswar Industrial Estate, 
Bhubaneswar.  
3.6 In such facts, the matter was taken up for investigation by 
the Central Bureau of Investigation (“CBI” for short) and the 
case was registered as T.R. No. 28 of 2002 in the Court of 
Special Judge (CBI), Bhubneswar.  
3.7 On 27th August 2002, the CBI filed the charge-sheet in the 
trial Court against all the accused persons, including the 
present appellants, for offences punishable under Sections 
120B, 420, 468, 471 of IPC and Sections 13(2) read with 
13(1)(d) of PC Act.  
3.8 Vide order dated 2nd September 2002, the trial Court took 

6 
cognizance and issued summons to the accused persons. 
3.9 The Bank also filed two Original Applications being O.A. No. 
53 and 57 of 2004 before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, 
Cuttack (“DRT” for short) for recovery of dues in respect of 
the loans advanced to IGPL and Clarion Travels. In the 
proceedings before the DRT, IGPL and Clarion Travels 
reached a One-Time-Settlement (“OTS” for short) with the 
Bank, which was accepted, and the loan account was 
declared as being closed vide letter dated 31st January 
2011. In view of the OTS, the recovery proceedings pending 
before the DRT were disposed of as a full and final payment 
of the dues of the Bank vide orders dated 3rd May 2011. 
3.10 Having settled the matter thus, the present appellants filed 
separate applications under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. before 
the High Court of Orissa seeking quashing of all the 
proceedings pending before the trial Court in the case 
registered as T.R. No. 28 of 2002. The High Court, vide the 
orders impugned in the present appeals disposed of the 
applications under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. by permitting the 

7 
appellants herein to urge all the pleas raised in their 
application before the trial Court at the appropriate stage. 
Being aggrieved thereby, the present appeal arises. 
4. 
We have heard Shri Dama Seshadri Naidu, learned Senior 
Counsel for the appellants and Shri Vikramjeet Banerjee learned 
Additional Solicitor General (“ASG” for short) appearing for the 
common respondent No.1-Union of India and Mr. Brijesh Kumar 
Tamber, learned counsel for common respondent No.2. 
5. 
Shri Naidu submits that the appellants before this Court 
had no active role to play.  It is submitted that the Appellant in 
Criminal Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (Criminal) 
No. 1415 of 2024 (Accused No.4) and the Appellant in Criminal 
Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 1416 
of 2024 (Accused No.5) are women.  Accused No. 4 is the wife of 
Surojit Sen, who was Accused No.2.  Accused No. 5 is the wife of 
the brother of the Accused No. 2.  Both the appellants had no 
active role to play and have been roped in as they are related to 
the Accused No.2.     
6. 
Shri Naidu further submits that in the proceedings before 

8 
the DRT, the firm run by the appellants reached to an amicable 
settlement with the Bank, which was accepted, and the entire 
debt was discharged on 31st January 2011.  An amount of 
Rs.7,50,000/- was deposited with the Bank as a full and final 
settlement of the Bank’s dues.   
7. 
It is further submitted that OA before the DRT was disposed 
of on 3rd May 2011 in light of the settlement and, therefore, the 
continuance of the proceedings against the appellants would be 
an exercise in futility.  
8. 
Shri Naidu in support of his submissions relied on the 
following judgments of this Court in the cases of: 
(i) 
Central Bureau of Investigation, SPE, SIU (X), New 
Delhi v. Duncans Agro Industries Ltd., Calcutta1; 
(ii) 
Nikhil Merchant v. Central Bureau of Investigation 
and another2; 
(iii) Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another3; 
(iv) 
Central Bureau of Investigation, ACB, Mumbai v. 
 
1 (1996) 5 SCC 591 
2 (2008) 9 SCC 677 
3 (2012) 10 SCC 303 

9 
Narendra Lal Jain and others4; 
(v) 
Narinder Singh and others v. State of Punjab and 
another5; 
(vi) 
Gold Quest International Private Limited v. State of 
Tamil Nadu and others6; and  
(vii) Central Bureau of Investigation v. Sadhu Ram 
Singla and others7. 
9. 
Mr. Brijesh Kumar Tamber, learned counsel for the 
respondent No.2 Bank confirms the fact regarding the settlement 
entered into between the Bank and the borrowers.  
10. Shri Vikramjeet Banerjee, learned ASG, appearing on behalf 
of the CBI, however, submits that merely because the matter is 
settled between the Bank and the borrowers, it does not absolve 
the accused persons of their criminal liability.  It is submitted 
that the learned Chief Justice of the High Court has rightly, upon 
consideration of the legal position, dismissed the petition under 
Section 482 of the CrPC.  The learned ASG, therefore, prays for 
 
4 (2014) 5 SCC 364 
5 (2014) 6 SCC 466 
6 (2014) 15 SCC 235 
7 (2017) 5 SCC 350 

10 
dismissal of the present appeals.   
11. The facts in the present case are not in dispute.  It is not 
disputed that the matter has been compromised between the 
borrowers and the Bank.  It has also not been in dispute that, 
upon payment of the amount under the OTS, the loan account of 
the borrower has been closed.  
12. Therefore, the only question would be, as to whether the 
continuation of the criminal proceedings against the present 
appellants would be justified or not.   
13. At the outset, we may state that we are only considering the 
cases of two women i.e. Accused Nos. 4 and 5, wherein Accused 
No.4 is the wife of Accused No.2.  It is also not in dispute that 
the original Accused Nos. 2 and 3 have since died.  
14. By a separate judgment of the even date in Criminal Appeal 
arising out of Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No.4353 of 2018 
wherein similar facts arose for consideration, we have held that 
when the matter has been compromised between the borrower 
and Bank, the continuation of the criminal proceedings would 
not be justifiable.   

11 
15. Relying on the earlier judgments of this Court, we have held 
that in the matters arising out of commercial, financial, 
mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the 
offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or family 
disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in 
nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute, the 
High Court should exercise its powers under Section 482 CrPC 
for giving an end to the criminal proceedings.  We have held that 
the possibility of conviction in such cases is remote and bleak 
and as such, the continuation of the criminal proceedings would 
put the accused to great oppression and prejudice.   
16. We find that for the aforesaid reasons the present appeals 
also deserve to be allowed.  
17. In the result, we pass the following order. 
(i) 
Criminal Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition 
(Criminal) No.1415 of 2024 is allowed. 
(ii) 
The impugned order dated 4th July 2023 passed by the 
High Court of Orissa at Cuttack in CRLMC No.34 of 
2022 is quashed and set aside.  

12 
(iii) Criminal Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition 
(Criminal) No.1416 of 2024 is allowed. 
(iv) 
The impugned order dated 4th July 2023 passed by the 
High Court of Orissa at Cuttack in CRLMC No.33 of 
2022 is quashed and set aside 
(v) 
The criminal proceedings against the appellants in 
T.R. No. 28 of 2002 pending in the Court of Special 
Judge (CBI) Bhubaneswar is also quashed and set 
aside.
