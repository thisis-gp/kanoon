6% per annum to the claimant i.e., the appellant herein being the mother of Shri
Suryakanth who expired in a road accident on 29th August, 2013. The Accident
Claims Tribunal, assessed and quantified the compensation in the following manner:-
“16. Loss of Dependency: The petitioner is the mother of deceased
Suryakanth. Admittedly, the age of the deceased is shown as 26 years
in the post mortem report as per Exh.P13, that is taken into account.
Regarding the income of the deceased, PW.1 has stated that the
deceased Suryakanth was doing as service consultant and drawing
monthly gross salary of Rs.56,935/- per month and to prove the said
fact she has produced Exh.P15 to Exh.P25 which are appointment
letter, Salary review letter, Salary certificates, certificate issued by
CISCO, PAN Card, Diploma Certificate, Income Tax Returns and Form
No.16 respectively, but as per Exh.P17 Salary Certificate which is of
the August 2013 of the deceased which shows the total earning of the
deceased is Rs. 50,942/-, so the said fact is taken into consideration
for awarding compensation amount, because as per the income tax
returns which are produced by the petitioner it is seen the deceased
was PAN cardholder and he was paying income tax which shown that
he was capable of earning the amount which is shown in the Exh.P17
and  even though the deceased was  working in  a private  limited
Company, the said salary amount is to be considered because he is
Diploma Certificate Holder and basing on his efficiency the Company
was paying the said amount to him. So for salary of Rs. 50,942/-
Professional Tax of Rs. 200/- is deducted which comes to Rs. 50,742/-
per month. Therefore, in my opinion, it is feasible to consider the
income of the deceased @ 50,742/- and annual income comes to
Rs.6,08,904/-. As the deceased was unmarried person, 50% of the
said amount is to be deducted, it comes to Rs.3,04,452/-. As per the
recent decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in 2015 (3) TAC.1
(SC) and case law reported in Sarla Varma and others V/s Delhi
Transport  Corporation  and  another  and  Rajesh  and  others,  the
deceased is also entitled for loss of future prospects at 50% of his
income. So, if 50% of the said Income is added Rs.3,04,452/- It would
be Rs.6,08,904/- (3,04,452 + 3,04,452) per annum. Regarding the age
of the deceased, In the post mortem report as per Exh.P13 the age of
the deceased is shown as 26 years. So, the same is taken into
consideration for applying multiplier as per the case law reported in
Sarla Verma and others V/s Delhi Transport Corporation and another is
"17". The calculation of the total loss of dependency is as under:
Rs.6,08,904  x  17  multiplier  =  Rs.1,03,51,368/-.  The  petitioner  is
entitled for loss of dependency Rs.1,03,51,368/-.
 
Therefore, the petitioner is entitled for total compensation
under different heads as follows:
1. Loss of Love and Affection
₹ 25,000-00
2.  Funeral Expenses
₹ 25,000-00
3.  Loss of Dependency
₹ 1,03,51,368-00
Total  Compensation  Rounded
off
₹ 1,04,01,368-00
₹ 1,04,01,000-00
Page 2 of 9

Therefore,  the  petitioner  is  entitled  for  total  compensation  of
Rs.1,04,01,000/- along with interest @ 6% per annum from the date of
petition till its realization.”
4.
The High Court, while considering the appeal preferred by respondent
No. 1- Insurance Company, concluded that the Accident Claims Tribunal’s approach
while assessing the compensation under the head of ‘loss of dependency’ was
erroneous on various grounds. It was held that the salary of the deceased, should
be based on the Annual Salary Review for the year 2013, according to which his
gross salary was  ₹ 4,88,982/- (Rupees four lakh eighty eight thousand nine
hundred and eighty two only). This figure realistically reflects what the deceased-
Suryakanth would have received for the year 2013. The High Court took the basic
salary of deceased-Suryakanth @ ₹ 2,30,652/- (Rupees two lakh thirty thousand
six hundred and fifty two only) per annum for calculating the loss of income and
only on the said figure, the future prospects @50% were applied, which worked out
to ₹ 1,15,326/- (Rupees one lakh fifteen thousand three hundred and twenty six
only).  As per the High Court, the total loss of income, including the allowances
worked out to ₹ 6,20,967/- (Rupees six lakh twenty thousand nine hundred and
sixty seven only).  From the said amount professional tax to the tune of  
₹ 2,400/-
(Rupees two thousand four hundred only) and Income Tax to the tune of @  ₹
61,857/- (Rupees sixty one thousand eighty hundred and fifty seven only) was
deducted and hence, the total annual income of the deceased-Suryakanth worked
out to ₹ 5,56,710/- (Rupees five lakh fifty six thousand seven hundred and ten only)
as per the High Court. The High Court in particular held that the components of
house rent allowance, flexible benefit plan and contribution to provident fund etc.
Page 3 of 9

could not be accounted for the purpose of adding 50% to the gross income of the
deceased on the principle of future prospects.
5.
Multiplier of 17 was applied to the said figure and 50% from the total
income calculated as above was deducted towards personal expenses considering
the fact that the claimant, i.e., the appellant herein, being the mother of the
deceased,  was  the  sole  dependent  of  the  deceased.   The  net  re-assessed
compensation as calculated by the High Court came out to  
₹ 49,57,035/- (Rupees
forty nine lakh fifty seven thousand and thirty five only).  Consequently, the
compensation awarded by the Accident Claims Tribunal was reduced as above
vide the  impugned  judgment  dated  2nd  August,  2017  which  is  subjected  to
challenge by the claimant-appellant by way of this appeal by special leave.
6.
Having heard and considered the submissions advanced by learned
counsel for the parties and after going through the impugned judgments and the
record, we are of the opinion that the reasoning assigned by the High Court, that
the perquisites/allowances in the nature of house rent, flexible benefit plan and
Company contribution to provident fund would have to be excluded from the gross
income for the purpose of applying future prospects, is erroneous on the face of
record.   There  cannot  be  any  two  views  on  the  aspect  that  these
perquisites/allowances admissible to a salaried employee do not remain static and
continue to rise generally proportionate to the length of the service of the employee.
These allowances are generally fixed on a pro rata basis with reference to the basic
salary.
Page 4 of 9

7.   
As per  the  service  conditions and  pay scales of  the  Government
officials, the house rent allowance is payable between 8% and 30% of the basic
salary. Therefore, the house rent allowance is paid in a fixed ratio proportionate to
the basic salary. With the increase in basic salary, the quantum of house rent
allowance also increases proportionately.  The flexible benefit plan and Company
contribution admissible to a person employed in private service would also not
remain static and are bound to increase with the length of service. The only bone of
contention in this appeal is whether perquisites/allowances referred to above
should also be taken into account while applying the future prospects. Therefore,
entirely excluding these components from the salary of the employee for applying
the principle of future prospects would be unjustified. Consequently, we have no
hesitation in holding that these allowances cannot be ignored and have to be added
to the salary when assessing the rise in income due to future prospects of a person
employed in private service. This Court has carved out a rational formula to fix the
percentage of rise of income by future prospects. In the case at hand, the said
percentage has been fixed at 50% by both, the Accident Claims Tribunal as well as
the Division Bench of the High Court. In view of the discussion made supra, the
perquisites/allowances have to be added to the basic salary of the deceased before
applying the rise by future prospects. 
8.
In Raghuvir Singh Matolya and Others v. Hari Singh Malviya and
Others4, this Court held that the house rent allowance ought to be included for
4 (2009) 15 SCC 363
Page 5 of 9

determining  the  income  of  the  deceased.  The  relevant  paras  are  extracted
hereinbelow for ready reference:-
“6. Dearness allowance, in our opinion, should form a part of the
income. House rent allowance is paid for the benefit of the family
members and not for the employee alone. What would constitute
an  income,  albeit  in  a  different  fact  situation,  came  up  for
consideration  before  this  Court  in National  Insurance  Co.
Ltd. v. Indira Srivastava [(2008) 2 SCC 763] wherein it was held:
“19. The amounts, therefore, which were required to be paid to
the deceased by his employer by way of perks, should be
included for computation of his monthly income as that would
have been added to his monthly income by way of contribution to
the family as contradistinguished to the ones which were for his
benefit. We may, however, hasten to add that from the said
amount  of  income,  the  statutory  amount  of  tax  payable
thereupon must be deducted.
20. The term ‘income’ in P. Ramanatha Aiyar's Advanced Law
Lexicon (3rd Edn.) has been defined as under:
‘(iii) the value of any benefit or perquisite whether convertible into
money or not, obtained from a company either by a director or a
person who has substantial interest in the company, and any
sum paid by such company in respect of any obligation, which
but for such payment would have been payable by the director or
other person aforesaid, occurring or arising to a person within
the  State  from  any  profession,  trade  or  calling  other  than
agriculture
.’It has also been stated: ‘ “Income” signifies “what comes in”
(per Selborne, C., Jones v. Ogle [(1861-73) All ER Rep 918] ). “It
is as large a word as can be used” to denote a person's receipts
(per Jessel, M.R., Huggins, ex p., Re [51 LJ Ch 935] ). Income is
not confined to receipts from business only and means periodical
receipts from one's work, lands, investments, etc. Secy. to the
Board  of  Revenue,  Income  Tax v. Al.  Ar.  Rm.  Arunachalam
Chettiar & Bros. [AIR 1921 Mad 427] Ref. Vulcun Insurance Co.
Ltd. v. Corpn. of Madras [AIR 1930 Mad 626 (2)] .’
21. If the dictionary meaning of the word ‘income’ is taken to its
logical conclusion, it should include those benefits, either in
terms of money or otherwise, which are taken into consideration
for the purpose of payment of income tax or professional tax
although some elements thereof may or may not be taxable or
would  have  been  otherwise  taxable  but  for  the  exemption
conferred thereupon under the statute.
To the same effect is the decision of this Court in Oriental
Insurance Company Limited v. Ram Prasad Varma and Others
[(2009) 2 SCC 712 : (2009) 1 SCC (Cri) 853 : (2009) 1 Scale
598].

7. We, therefore, are of the opinion that “dearness allowance”
and  “house rent allowance” payable to the deceased should
have been included for determining the income of the deceased
and consequently the amount of compensation.

9. 
Recently in a judgment dated 11th July, 2024 in  National Insurance
Company Ltd. v. Nalini and Ors. [Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (C) No.
4230/2019],  this  Court  held  that,  allowances  under  the  heads  of  transport
allowance, house rent allowance, provident fund loan, provident fund and special
allowance  ought  to  be  added  while  considering  the  basic  salary  of  the
victim/deceased to arrive at the dependency factor.
10.
Therefore, components of house rent allowance, flexible benefit plan
and company contribution to provident fund have to be included in the salary of the
deceased while applying the component of rise in income by future prospects to
determine the dependency factor.  The Accident Claims Tribunal was justified in
factoring these components into the salary of the deceased, before applying 50%
rise  by  future  prospects  due  to  future  prospects,  while  calculating  the  total
compensation payable to the appellant.
11.
Clearly, the High Court erred in accepting the appeal filed by the
respondent No. 1-  Insurance Company and reducing the compensation payable to
the appellant from a sum of  
 
₹ 1,04,01,000/- (Rupees One crore four lakh one
thousand only) awarded by the Accident Claims Tribunal to  
₹ 49,57,035/-(Rupees
Forty nine lakh fifty seven thousand and thirty five only).
Page 7 of 9

12.
We, therefore, hold that the High Court has erred while omitting to add
the components of house rent allowance, flexible benefit plan and Company
contribution to provident fund to the basic salary of the deceased while applying the
principle of rise in income by future prospects.
13.
However, we are of the opinion that the High Court was justified in
deducting Income Tax from the gross salary of the deceased-Suryakanth for
calculating his gross income. This factor was overlooked by the Accident Claims
Tribunal while quantifying the award. 
14.
As a result, the re-assessed compensation payable to the appellant
after making deduction towards Income Tax is tabulated in the following manner: -
