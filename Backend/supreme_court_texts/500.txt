the impugned order, dismissed the second 
appeal.  
3. Following are the facts leading to the Civil Suit 
in question: 
On 27.12.1979, Mansha Ram, Dev Raj, 
Khazana Ram, Ramji Das and Bihari Lal 
(hereinafter referred as “Mansha Ram and 
others”) filed a suit (Civil Suit No. 43 of 1983) for 
declaration and permanent injunction against 
Julfi Ram, Tihru Ram, Bakshi Ram- all three are 
sons of Khajana, Prem Chand-son of Julfi Ram, 
Kartar Chand-son of Bakshi Ram and Dharam 
Singh son of Nighu. Plaintiffs were the 
landowners and defendants were the co-tenants 
of the land. The Plaintiffs sought a declaration 
that they are owners in possession of suit land 
measuring 7 kanals 9 marlas. They also sought 
permanent injunction restraining defendants 
from interfering in the land in suit. The 
defendants contested the suit and stated that 
they are in cultivatory possession as tenants on 
payment. Thus, they claimed to be owners by 
virtue of tenancy.  

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 3 of 17 
4. Trial Court by order dated 11.04.1983, decreed 
the suit in favor of plaintiffs- Mansha Ram & 
others granting them both the reliefs of 
declaration and permanent injunction by 
holding that they are owners in possession. 
Aggrieved, all six defendants preferred an 
appeal before the District Judge. As one of the 
plaintiffs -Dev Raj had died during the 
pendency, his widow Asha Devi and his son 
Suresh Kumar were arrayed as Respondents in 
the First Appeal.  
5. During the pendency of appeal, on 22.08.1983 
Mansha Ram and others executed a sale deed 
in favour of Kartar Chand, Sansar Chand and 
Rajinder Kumar- three sons of Bakshi Ram for 
consideration 
of 
Rs. 
12,500/-. 
The 
first 
Appellate Court, by order dated 20.08.1984, 
allowed the appeal, setting aside the decree of 
Trial Court in light of statements made by 
plaintiffs before the court. It noted that ‘the 
plaintiffs have compromised the case and stated 
that they do not want to pursue with the suit 
and it to be dismissed.’ Before the first Appellate 
Court, Julfi Ram, Tihru Ram, Bakshi Ram, 

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 4 of 17 
Prem Chand and Kartar Singh made a joint 
statement on 20.06.1984 that they have 
reached a settlement with Respondents. They 
have also paid money to Mansha Ram and 
others and they shall be the owners and hold 
possession of the land in dispute. Thus, Suit 
filed by Plaintiffs be dismissed. Dharam Singh- 
son of Nighu recorded a separate statement to 
the same effect. On the other hand, Bihari Lal, 
Suresh Kumar (son of Devraj and holder of 
General power of attorney of Asha Devi), Ramji 
Das and Dhyan Chand made a statement that 
they have reached a settlement and have 
received 
money. 
Thus, 
possession 
and 
ownership 
of 
the 
land 
shall 
be 
with 
appellants/defendants. 
Mansha 
Ram 
and 
Khazana Ram also recorded their statements on 
20.06.1984, 
that 
they 
have 
reached 
a 
settlement and the suit may be dismissed. 
These four statements are on record of the High 
Court and of this Court.  
6. Appellants submit that Bakshi Ram’s three son 
got exclusive possession and mutation in 
revenue records by virtue of the sale deed dated 

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 5 of 17 
22.08.1983. However, the Respondents submit 
that by virtue of dismissal of suit by first 
Appellate Court, all four brothers- Julfi, Tihru, 
Bakshi and Nighu became owners and the sale 
deed executed in favour of the three sons of 
Bakshi Ram shall be subject to compromise 
decree passed by first Appellate Court.  
7. On 23.02.1988, the present suit (Civil Suit No. 
41 
of 
1988) 
was 
instituted 
by 
Respondents/Plaintiffs- 
Julfi 
Ram, 
Prem 
Chand, Dharam Singh, Premi Devi, Atmi Devi, 
Asha Devi, Subhash Chand and Gian Chand- 
two sons of Nighu represented by their mother 
Premi Devi (hereinafter referred as “Julfi Ram 
and others”) against appellants/Defendants- 
Bakshi Ram(since deceased), Tihru Ram, Amro 
Devi (wife of Bakshi Ram), Sansar Chand, 
Kartar Chand, Rajinder Kumar (minor son of 
Bakshi Ram), Mansha Ram, Khazana Ram, 
Ramji Das, Bihari Lal and Asha Devi- widow of 
Suresh Kumar (hereinafter referred as “Bakshi 
Ram and others”). Thus, the erstwhile owners 
Mansha Ram and others were also impleaded as 
defendants. The suit was filed for declaration 

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 6 of 17 
and permanent prohibitory injunction claiming 
that plaintiffs are owners in possession of half 
share i.e. 3 kanals 15 marlas in the suit land as 
per the compromise between parties in Civil 
Appeal decided by District Court on 20.08.1984. 
Plaintiffs also stated that they continued to be 
in possession and they were cultivating the 
land. However, in June 1987 the defendants 
started interfering with the land in suit stating 
that they have purchased the land and plaintiff 
cannot continue to cultivate. Only at this stage 
plaintiffs claim to have received knowledge 
about mutation entries where only the names of 
defendants have been recorded.  
8. On the other hand, defendants (Bakshi Ram 
and others) submitted a written statement on 
28.01.1992, contending that there was no 
compromise in earlier proceedings since no 
compromise deed was executed and placed on 
record before the Court in appeal. They also 
claimed that they have spent Rs. 9,000/- on 
improvement of suit land after the purchase.  
9. The Trial Court, by order dated 19.12.1992, 
dismissed the suit. It held that for proceeding 

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 7 of 17 
under Order XXIII Rule 3 of Code of Civil 
Procedure, 19081 the existence and production 
of written compromise between the parties duly 
signed by them is most important. It relied upon 
the ruling of this Court in Gurpreet Singh vs 
Chaturbhuj Gopal2. Since the said compromise 
was not presented in written form duly signed 
by the parties, the mandate under Order XXIII 
Rule 3 CPC is not fulfilled and thus it lacks legal 
force. The Trial Court also held that statements 
before the District Court cannot be treated as 
agreement or compromise. On the fact of 
possession, the Trial Court noted that plaintiffs 
could not prove that they were in possession 
and in cultivation of the land in suit as pleaded. 
 
10. 
As the Trial Court dismissed the suit, Julfi 
Ram 
and 
others 
preferred 
Civil 
Appeal 
No.17/1993 
before 
the 
District 
Judge, 
Hamirpur. By order dated 21.12.2001, the 
District Judge, allowed the appeal thereby 
decreeing the suit. It held that the Trial Court 
 
1 CPC 
2 AIR 1988 SC 400. 

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 8 of 17 
had no occasion to comment upon the legality 
of 
compromise 
because 
neither 
parties 
challenged the compromise decree by filing an 
appeal under Order 43 Rule 1-A of CPC. Thus, 
it operated as res judicata and could not have 
been re-opened in a subsequent suit. The said 
compromise would be binding on parties. On 
merits, 
it 
observed 
that 
the 
sale 
was 
clandestinely executed by the vendors (Mansha 
Ram and others) in favour of sons of Bakshi 
Ram. It further stated that even if the sale deed 
is considered to be valid, the same cannot be 
allowed to be acted upon as it has been executed 
during the pendency of Civil Appeal No. 64 of 
1993 between the parties.  
11. 
The Appellants/defendants preferred a 
Regular Second Appeal No. 55 of 2002 before 
the High Court. The High Court, by the  
impugned order, dismissed the same and 
confirmed the decree passed by the first 
Appellate Court dated 21.12.2001. The High 
Court held that execution of sale deed does not 
either abrogate, detract or dilute the effect of a 
previous conclusive determination comprised in 

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 9 of 17 
the decree of  1984.  Thus, the rights of plaintiffs 
remained intact to the extent of one-half share 
in the suit land. The sale deed is thus hit by the 
doctrine of lis pendens.  
12. 
We have heard learned counsel for the 
parties and perused the material on record. The 
question to be determined in the present case is 
as to what is the status of the so called 
compromise order dated 20th August 1984 in 
the first round of litigation. The plaintiffs in the 
second round of litigation were the defendants 
whereas the Mansha Ram and others were 
plaintiffs in the first round of litigation. The first 
suit was for declaration and for permanent 
injunction on account of interference by the 
defendants therein. The plaintiffs were already 
recorded in the revenue records. Their suit was 
decreed by the Trial Court on 11.04.1983. At the 
time of execution of sale deed, on 22.08.1983, 
in favour of present appellants (defendants in 
second suit, Mansha Ram and others) were fully 
competent to execute the sale deed. It is true 
that when the said sale deed was executed, the 

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 10 of 17 
first appeal was pending before the first 
Appellate Court.  
13. 
Before the first Appellate Court, the 
plaintiff-respondent therein Bihari Lal gave a 
short statement to the effect that they had 
reached a settlement, received money and that 
possession and ownership of the land would be 
with the appellants. Mansha Ram and Khazana 
Ram stated that they had reached a settlement 
with the appellants, they agreed to the 
statement of the appellant that suit may be 
dismissed. At the same time appellants Julfi 
Ram and others stated that they have reached a 
settlement with the respondents, they had paid 
money to Mansha Ram and others, that they 
shall be owners in possession of the land in 
dispute and that the suit be dismissed.  
14. 
Based on these statements, the District 
Judge, Hamirpur by order dated 20.08.1984 
accepted the appeal, set aside the judgement 
and decree of Trial Court and dismissed the 
suit. It further directed that decree sheet be 
prepared and file be consigned to the record. 
The effect of this decree would be that the suit 

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 11 of 17 
of the plaintiffs was dismissed. No declaration 
was granted to the defendants in the said suit. 
There was no written compromise deed between 
the parties, there was no verification as such of 
any written document.  
15. 
At best, under the alleged compromise 
order of dismissal of suit the defendants therein 
could have claimed to be in possession of the 
land in suit and no further. The ownership 
could not have been transferred because of the 
dismissal of the suit. Even assuming for the 
sake of argument that ownership rights were 
also transferred under the alleged compromise 
deed, the sale deed executed prior to the said 
compromise will not be affected in any manner 
as the plaintiffs were not only recorded as land 
owners but also had a decree of declaration and 
permanent injunction in their favour at the time 
when sale deed was executed.  
16. 
The defendants, in the first round of 
litigation, were admittedly tenants. They could 
have become owners of the land in suit either by 
way of a registered sale deed in their favour or 
by way of a declaration by the Competent Civil 

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 12 of 17 
Court whether on merits or by way of a 
compromise decree granting such declaration. 
Neither of the two happened. Merely because 
some statement of the parties is recorded by the 
first Appellate Court that they have settled the 
dispute and that the suit may be dismissed, 
would not make the defendants therein from 
tenants to owners. Dismissal of the suit would 
only mean that their status as tenants would 
continue. 
17. 
The first Appellate Court and the High 
Court failed to consider that there was no 
challenge to the sale deed dated 22.08.1983. 
The doctrine of lis pendens or the restriction 
imposed under section 52 of the Transfer of 
Property Act, 18823 may not be relevant or 
applicable in present case considering the fact 
that one of the parties- plaintiffs in the 
proceedings and respondents in pending appeal 
having executed the sale deed during the 
pendency of appeal, by their subsequent 
conduct of giving a statement that their suit be 
 
3 The TP Act. 

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 13 of 17 
dismissed, acted in dishonest and unfair 
manner. They were fully aware of having 
executed the sale deed, their subsequent 
statement would only be termed as collusive 
and dishonest. The order in the appeal court 
was not a decree on merits declaring any rights 
of the defendants to the suit (appellants in the 
appeal). In such circumstances, the sale deed 
dated 22.08.1983 could not be said to be hit by 
doctrine of lis pendens.  
18. 
At this juncture, it would be appropriate to 
note the judicial decision which has been relied 
upon by the appellants to substantiate their 
claim that the sale deed is not hit by Section 52 
of the TP Act. In Thomson Press (India) Ltd. v. 
Nanak Builders & Investors (P) Ltd.4 it was 
held that transfer of suit property pendente lite 
is not void ab initio, as it remains subservient to 
the pending litigation. The purchaser of any 
such property takes the bargain subject to the 
rights of the plaintiff in pending suit. Therefore, 
 
4 (2013) 5 SCC 397. 

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 14 of 17 
in the present case the sale deed dated 
22.08.1983 is not hit by section 52 of the TP Act.  
19. 
Referring to the second submission of the 
respondents regarding the compromise decree 
being valid in law, at the outset, Order XXIII 
Rule 3 CPC is reproduced: 
“3. Compromise of suit.—Where it is proved 
to the satisfaction of the Court that a suit has 
been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful 
agreement or compromise 1 [in writing and 
signed by the parties] or where the defendant 
satisfied the plaintiff in respect to the whole 
or any part of the subject-matter of the suit, 
the Court shall order such agreement, 
compromise or satisfaction to be recorded, 
and shall pass a decree in accordance 
therewith 2 [so far as it relates to the parties 
to the suit, whether or not the subject matter 
of the agreement, compromise or satisfaction 
is the same as the subject-matter of the suit:] 
 
 [Provided that where it is alleged by one 
party and denied by the other that an 
adjustment or satisfaction has been arrived 
at, the Court shall decide the question; but 
not adjournment shall be granted for the 
purpose of deciding the question, unless the 
Court, for reasons to be recorded, thinks fit 
to grant such adjournment.]  
 
[Explanation.— 
An 
agreement 
or 
compromise which is void or voidable under 
the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872), 

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 15 of 17 
shall not he deemed to be lawful within the 
meaning of this rule.]” 
 
20. 
A plain reading of the above provision 
clearly provides that for a valid compromise in a 
suit there has to be a lawful agreement or 
compromise in writing and signed by the parties 
which would then require it to be proved to the 
satisfaction of the Court. In the present case 
there is no document in writing containing the 
terms of the agreement or compromise. In the 
absence of any document in writing, the 
question of the parties signing it does not arise. 
Even the question of proving such document to 
the satisfaction of the Court to be lawful, also 
did not arise. Thus, it cannot be said that the 
order dated 20.08.1984 was an order under 
Order XXIII Rule 3 CPC. 
21. 
Once it is held that the order dated 
20.08.1984 was not an order of compromise of 
suit under Order XXIII Rule 3 CPC the argument 
relating to applicability and bar under Order 
XXIII Rule 3A CPC would have no relevance at 
all.  

SLP(C) No.14690 of 2015 
 
Page 16 of 17 
22. 
Additionally, we must also note the case of 
Som Dev v. Rati Ram5 as presented by the 
appellants to clarify the rigors of Order XXIII 
Rule 3 of CPC. In this case, it was clarified by 
this Court that after the amendment of Code of 
Civil Procedure in 1977, a compromise decree 
can be passed only on compliance with the 
requirements of Rule 3 of Order XXIII, otherwise 
it may not be possible to recognize the same as 
compromise decree. When a compromise is to 
be recorded and a decree is to be passed, Rule 
3 of Order XXIII of the Code requires that the 
terms of compromise should be reduced to 
writing and signed by the parties.  
23. 
In 
the 
present 
case, 
neither 
the 
compromise deed has been reduced to writing, 
nor it is recorded by the court. Mere statements 
of the parties before court about such said 
compromise, cannot satisfy the requirements of 
Order XXIII Rule 3 of the CPC. Therefore, the 
compromise decree is not valid.

24. 
In view of the above analysis, the present 
Civil Appeal is allowed, the orders passed by the 
High Court and first Appellate Court are set 
aside. The judgment and decree of Trial Court 
dated 19.12.1992 dismissing the suit is 
confirmed.  
25. 
Pending application(s), if any, is/are 
disposed of.
