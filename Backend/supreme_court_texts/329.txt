A.  
FACTUAL MATRIX  
1. Since the issues raised in both the captioned appeals are the same; the parties 
are also the same and the challenge is also to the self-same impugned common 
judgment and order passed by the High Court, those were taken up for hearing 
analogously and are being disposed of by this common judgment and order.  
 
2. The appellants herein are the original defendants and the respondent herein is 
the original plaintiff.  
 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 3 of 91 
3. The present appeals arise from the impugned common judgment and order 
dated 10.06.2022 (“impugned judgment”) passed by the High Court of 
Telangana at Hyderabad partly allowing the Appeal Suit No. 808 of 2002 and 
Appeal Suit No. 913 of 2004 respectively preferred by the original defendants 
and the original plaintiff respectively against the judgment and decree dated 
19.09.2001 passed by the Senior Civil Judge, Peddapalli in O.S. No. 37 of 
1996 decreeing the suit partly in favour of the original plaintiff.  
 
4. M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited, that is, the original plaintiff, is a 
company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 established with the 
assistance of the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Development Corporation Limited 
(“APIDC”) and is engaged in the manufacturing of High Density Poly 
Ethylene (“HDPE”) bags.  
 
5. Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. (“FCIL”), that is, the defendant company, 
is a Public Sector Undertaking (“PSU”) of the Government of India 
established for the manufacturing of fertilisers and are operating under the 
administrative control of the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, 
Government of India.   
 
6. The original defendants required HDPE bags for the purpose of packaging and 
supply of fertiliser to their customers. They had been placing orders for the 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 4 of 91 
same with the original plaintiff since 1986-87 onwards. The terms and 
conditions including the technical specifications of the bags and terms of 
payment were specified in the notices inviting tender (“NIT”) issued from 
time to time and the purchase orders issued in pursuance thereof. As per the 
terms of the NIT, the original defendants were required to make the entire 
payment within 20 days of the receipt of the bags and approval of the same. 
The terms of the purchase orders also entitled the original defendants to deduct 
up to a maximum of 5% of the contract price towards liquidated damages upon 
delay in supply of bags by the original plaintiff.  
i. 
Case of the original plaintiff before the trial court 
7. The case of the original plaintiff before the trial court was that the original 
defendants placed with it certain purchase orders for the supply of the HDPE 
bags, which were manufactured by it as per the specifications and duly 
supplied periodically. The purchase orders were amended from time to time 
to account for the increase in the number of bags which were required by the 
original defendants. It was the case of the original plaintiff that in pursuance 
of the communications exchanged with the original defendants, it supplied 
42,000 bags over and above the quantity mentioned in the purchase orders to 
meet with the urgent requirements of the original defendants, on the 
understanding that a subsequent purchase order would be issued to account 
for the extra supply.  

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 5 of 91 
 
8. The grievance of the original plaintiff was that when a formal purchase order 
was subsequently issued by the original defendants to account for the extra 
bags supplied by the original plaintiff, the price per bag mentioned in the said 
order fell short of the price agreed upon between the parties. The original 
plaintiff was also aggrieved by the deductions made by the original defendants 
towards the liquidated damages for the alleged delay in supply of the bags and 
the penalty imposed towards the supply of the alleged poor quality of the bags. 
The original plaintiff also claimed to have suffered losses due to the refusal of 
the original defendants to accept 25,000 bags after placing the order, which 
were printed as per the specifications prescribed by the original defendants 
and had to be sold as scrap due to non-acceptance by the original defendants.  
    
9. With a view to recover the aforesaid losses, the original plaintiff instituted the 
civil suit for the recovery of Rs 8,27,100.74/- along with Rs 10,31,803.14/- 
towards interest up to the date of institution of the suit. A detailed break-up of 
the claim of the original plaintiff before the trial court is as follows:

ii. 
Case of the original defendants before the trial court 
10.  The original defendants filed their written statement before the trial court 
stating that there was no discrepancy in the purchase order issued subsequent 
to the supply of the extra bags and that the imposition of liquidated damages 
was justified as per the terms of the NIT and the purchase orders. It was also 
stated that the deductions imposed as penalty for the supply of poor quality of 
the bags was also justified and interest @ 24% was not liable to be imposed.  

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 7 of 91 
 
11.  The original defendants further stated before the trial court that as they had 
been declared to be a sick company under Section 3(1)(o) of the Sick Industrial 
Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (“the 1985 Act”), the suit for 
recovery was not maintainable as per Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act and thus 
was liable to be dismissed.  
 
12.  The trial court, having regard to the specific pleadings of the parties 
proceeded to frame 10 issues as tabulated hereinbelow.  
S. No.

due to refusal on the part of the defendants 
to take delivery of the bags? 
interest @ 12% p.a. from 
01.01.1994 till realisation.   
7. 
Whether the defendants had called for a 
fresh tender after placing of the orders to

plaintiff 
10. 
Whether the suit of the plaintiff was barred 
by limitation?

plaintiff 
  
13.  On the issue of applicability of Section 22 of the 1985 Act, it was observed 
thus by the trial court:  
“Both sides have not argued on this issue and no material is 
produced before the Court and no evidence is also adduced on this 
issue. Hence, the defendant company failed to prove that it is a sick 
industry and the plaintiff’s suit is maintainable. I answer this issue 
in favour of the Plaintiff accordingly” 
 
 
14.  The final decree drawn by the trial court reads thus:  
“1. That the suit of the plaintiff be and is hereby decreed. 
 
2. That the defendants 1 to 4 be and are hereby directed to pay Rs. 
55,710/-, Rs. 100,848 and Rs. 1,18,000/- to the plaintiff together 
with interest @ 12% per annum from 01.01.1994 till realization.

pay Rs. 1,72,734/- to the plaintiff together with interest @ 12% per 
annum from 16.07.1994 till realization. 
 
4 That the suit of the plaintiff for the rest of the claim of Rs. 
4,89,919/- be and is hereby dismissed. 
 
5. That the defendants do pay Rs. 37,169/- to the plaintiff towards 
the costs of the suit.” 
 
iii. 
Appeals before the High Court  
15.  Both the parties went to the High Court in appeal against the aforesaid 
decision of the trial court. The original plaintiff contended before the High 
Court, inter alia, that the deductions towards the liquidated damages and 
penalty were wrongly imposed on it by the original defendants, and that the 
interest at the rate of 24% with monthly compounding ought to have been 
granted on the delayed payments in light of the provisions of the Interest on 
Delayed Payments to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 
1993 (“the 1993 Act”).  
 
16.  The original defendants on the other hand contested that the trial court had 
failed to consider the evidence properly and had wrongly awarded the amounts 
under different heads to the original plaintiff. The contention as to the 
applicability of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act was also raised by the original 
defendants.  
 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 10 of 91 
17.  The High Court, vide the impugned judgment partly allowed both the appeals. 
The original defendants were allowed to deduct an amount of Rs 1,63,471/- 
towards the liquidated damages, whereas the original plaintiff was allowed to 
recover the amounts deducted towards penalty, price difference in the supply 
of 42,000 bags and the loss incurred due to the refusal of the original 
defendants to accept the delivery of 25,000 bags. Pertinently, the High Court 
accepted the contention of the original plaintiff on the issue of interest and 
granted 24% compound interest on the amounts due.  
 
18.  Despite recording the submissions of the parties on the applicability of 
Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act, neither any point for determination was framed 
nor any finding was returned on the same by the High Court.  
 
19.  Aggrieved by the impugned judgment, more particularly as regards the 
awarding of 24% interest in favour of the original plaintiff – which has inflated 
the principal decretal amount to one of mammoth proportions – the original 
defendants are before this Court with the present appeals.  
 
B.  
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS/ORIGINAL 
 
DEFENDANTS 
 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 11 of 91 
20.  Ms. Malvika Trivedi, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the 
original defendants submitted that the 1985 Act overrides the 1993 Act as the 
same was enacted in the larger public interest by the Parliament with a view 
to secure the directive specified under Article 39 of the Constitution.  
 
21.  It was further submitted that the 1993 Act having been enacted to provide for 
and regulate the payment of interest on delayed payments to the small-scale 
industries, does not envisage a situation where an industrial undertaking 
becomes sick and requires a scheme for its revival.   
 
22.  It was argued that the provisions of the 1985 Act should be given the widest 
possible import in light of the fact that the same is a self-contained code 
containing provisions like the statutory bar on civil suits for recovery of 
money from sick industrial companies under Section 22 and the non-obstante 
clause under Section 32 by virtue of which the provisions of the 1985 Act are 
given an overriding effect. Reliance was placed by the learned senior counsel 
upon the decisions of this Court in Jay Engineering Works Ltd. v. Industry 
Facilitation Council reported in (2006) 8 SCC 677 and Tata Motors Ltd. v. 
Pharmaceutical Products of India Ltd. reported in (2008) 7 SCC 619.  
 
23.  It was further submitted that the impugned judgment and order passed by the 
High Court failed to take into consideration the law settled by this Court in 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 12 of 91 
Bhoruka Textiles Ltd. v. Kashmiri Rice Industries reported in (2009) 7 SCC 
521 which held that if the jurisdiction of the civil court was ousted in terms of 
the jurisdictional bar imposed under Section 22 of the 1985 Act, then any 
judgment rendered by it would be coram non-judice and as a result a nullity. 
 
24.  To fortify her aforesaid submission, the learned senior counsel argued that the 
facts of the present case are similar to the facts in Bhoruka Textiles (supra) as 
follows:  
I. 
The defendant company was declared as a sick industrial undertaking 
under Section 3(1)(o) of the 1985 Act and was referred to the BIFR for 
its revival on 06.11.1992 and an enquiry under Section(s) 16 and 17 
respectively of the 1985 Act was pending in respect of the defendant 
company at the time of the institution of the suit by the original plaintiff 
before the trial court.  
II. 
The suit for recovery of money was instituted by the original plaintiff 
against the original defendants without obtaining the consent of the 
BIFR, as mandated by Section 22 of the 1985 Act.  
III. 
Despite the statutory bar under Section 22 against the institution of a 
suit for the recovery of money, the trial court decided the suit and 
decreed it. Even the High Court in the impugned judgment failed to 
decide the issue of lack of jurisdiction of the trial court in deciding the 
suit. 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 13 of 91 
  
25.  The learned senior counsel further submitted that the contention of the 
original plaintiff that the statutory bar under Section 22 of the 1985 Act applies 
only against a recognized creditor and such debts as are acknowledged before 
the BIFR during the pendency of the reference application is not the correct 
understanding of the law and is against the beneficial object of the Act. It was 
contended that the reliance placed by the original plaintiff on the decision of 
the Delhi High Court in Sunil Mittal Properties of Shree Shyam Packaging 
Industries v. M/s LML Ltd. reported in (2011) 123 DRJ 249 is misplaced as 
the said decision failed to consider the law settled by this Court in Bhoruka 
Textiles (supra) and thus could be termed as per incuriam.  
 
26.  One another submission made by the learned senior counsel was that out of 
the total claim put forward by the original plaintiff before the trial court, only 
the amount of Rs 55,710/- could have been recognized as delayed payment. It 
was submitted that the deductions made by the original defendants towards 
liquidated damages and penalty while remitting the payment to the original 
plaintiff could not have been classified as delayed payment for the purpose of 
computation of interest under the 1993 Act and the interest could only have 
been claimed on the undisputed and agreed upon sum under the contract.  
 
27.  It was argued that the liability, if any, of the original defendants to pay interest 
on the amount of Rs 4,89,919.99/- should be limited from the date of the 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 14 of 91 
impugned judgment, wherein the High Court while partially modifying the 
decree awarded by the trial court, awarded the amount as above in favour of 
the original plaintiff for the first time.  
 
28.  It was also argued that the High Court erred in interfering with the exercise 
of discretion by the trial court in awarding 12% pendente lite interest in favour 
of the original plaintiff.  
 
29.  The learned senior counsel further submitted that the original plaintiff had the 
option of taking recourse to the mechanism prescribed under Section 6 of the 
1993 Act which provides for making a reference of any dispute to the Industry 
Facilitation Council for acting as an arbitrator or a conciliator. However, by 
consciously approaching the civil court by way of a suit for recovery of money 
despite the jurisdictional bar contained under Section 22 of the Act, the 
original plaintiff must now face the consequences of approaching a non-
jurisdictional forum. 
  
30.  Lastly, it was submitted by the learned senior counsel that the defendant 
company remained under BIFR for a period of 21 years and was revived in 
2013 after intervention of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs. The 
economic distress caused by the enforcement of the liability imposed upon the 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 15 of 91 
original defendants by the High Court may potentially overwhelm the efforts 
at revival of the defendant company.   
 
C.  SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT/ORIGINAL 
PLAINTIFF 
 
31.  Mr. Sundeep Pothina, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original 
plaintiff submitted at the outset that Section 22 of the 1985 Act is not 
applicable to the instant case as neither the debt came to be acknowledged, nor 
the name of the creditor company figured before the BIFR. Since, in the case 
on hand, the original defendants did not include the liability of the original 
plaintiff in their list of liabilities in accordance with Section 21(a)(i) of the 
1985 Act nor in their book of accounts under Section 21(a)(ii) of the 1985 Act 
nor did it include the original plaintiff company in the list of creditors under 
Section 21(b) of the 1985 Act at the time of reference or thereafter, the 
jurisdictional bar available under Section 22 of the 1985 Act cannot be said to 
be applicable to the suit instituted by the original plaintiff.  
 
32.  It was further submitted that the reliance placed by the original defendants on 
Bhoruka Textiles (supra) in support of their contention regarding Section 22 
of the 1985 Act is misplaced for the following reasons:  
I. 
This Court in Bhoruka Textiles (supra) decided the issue as to whether 
the bar under Section 22 of the 1985 Act would apply to a suit for 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 16 of 91 
recovery instituted for defaults occurring post the reference of the sick 
industrial company to the BIFR when the reference was pending. 
However, the issue in the present case is different and pertains to 
whether a suit for determination of ‘illegal deductions’ and ‘breach of 
contract’ and liability would be barred by virtue of Section 22 of the 
Act.  
II. 
In Bhoruka Textiles (supra), not only the debt but the creditor was also 
acknowledged before the BIFR and there was no dispute on the issue or 
size of default. However, in the present case, both the existence and 
quantum of liability are under dispute. The original defendants have not 
referred to the original plaintiff as a ‘creditor’ before any forum.  
 
33.  It was further argued that the reliance placed by the original defendants on 
Jay Engineering (supra) is also of no avail as in the facts of that case, there 
was no dispute over the quantum of dues and the sick company therein had 
reckoned the dues and the liabilities were covered in the revised rehabilitation 
scheme. Further, the decision in the said case only supports the contention of 
the original plaintiff that the adjudicatory process of making an award is not 
barred under Section 22 of the 1985 Act and it is only the execution of such 
an award against a sick company which is protected under Section 22 of the 
1985 Act. Thus, as the civil court in this case was the adjudicating authority 
having inherent jurisdiction to decide the suit under Section 9 of the Civil 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 17 of 91 
Procedure Code, 1908, the adjudicatory part of determining the liability 
couldn’t be said to have been barred by Section 22 of the Act. It is only the 
execution of such a decree arrived at as a result of the adjudicatory process 
which could be said to be barred under Section 22 of the 1985 Act during the 
period when the sick company is under the protection of the BIFR.  
 
34.   The learned counsel further submitted that the reliance placed by the original 
defendants on the decision of this Court in Tata Motors (supra) is also 
misplaced as the said decision pertains to Section 26 of the 1985 Act while the 
case on hand pertains to the applicability of Section 22 of the 1985 Act. He 
contended that even the said decision supports the case of the original plaintiff 
as it explains the distinction between the adjudicatory authority of a civil court 
and the BIFR and holds that the jurisdiction of a civil court is barred in respect 
of any matter for which the BIFR or the Appellate Authority for Industrial and 
Financial Reconstruction (“AAIFR”) is empowered.  
 
35.  The learned counsel, while placing reliance on the decision of the Delhi High 
Court in Sunil Mittal (supra), argued that the facts of the present case are 
squarely covered by the said decision. It was submitted that in the said case, a 
distinction was drawn between the ‘process of assessment’ and ‘quantified 
recoveries’ and it was held that while the realisation of the latter is stayed by 
virtue of Section 22 of the 1985 Act, the former, which is the process of 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 18 of 91 
finalisation of liability, does not get stayed by operation of Section 22 of the 
1985 Act.   
 
36.  The learned counsel submitted that the contention of the original defendants 
that the decision in Sunil Mittal (supra) is rendered per-incuriam as the same 
failed to consider the decision in Bhoruka Textiles (supra) is incorrect as the 
court therein had based its decision on the judgment of a division bench of the 
Delhi High Court in Saketh India Limited v. W. Diamond India Ltd. reported 
in 2010 SCC OnLine Del 1786. The decision in Saketh India (supra) has 
exhaustively considered the various decisions of this Court on the issue of 
applicability of jurisdictional bar under Section 22 of the 1985 Act and thus 
the decision in Sunil Mittal (supra) cannot be characterised as per-incuriam.  
 
37.  The learned counsel submitted that the High Court in its impugned judgment 
has determined the issue of rate of interest under Section 4 of the 1993 Act. 
The High Court, after looking into the relevant material, observed that the 
floor rate charged by the State Bank of India (“SBI”) for the financial year 
1993-94 was 19% and thus awarded interest at 24% which is 5 per-cent points 
above the floor rate.  
 
38.  The learned counsel, in the last, submitted that as opposed to the 
representations made by the defendant company about its current financial

Page 19 of 91 
status, the net worth of the defendant company as on 31.03.2022 is in the 
positive and is at the least not less than 2,000/- crores.  
 
D.  
ANALYSIS 
39.  Before adverting to the rival submissions canvassed on either side, we would 
like to briefly discuss the proceedings in respect of the defendant company 
before the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (“BIFR”) in 
terms of Section 15 of the 1985 Act.  
i. 
Proceedings in respect of FCIL before the BIFR 
 
40.   At the end of financial year 1991-92, the defendant company suffered huge 
erosion in its net worth and became a sick industrial company. Accordingly, a 
reference was made to the BIFR in terms of Section 15 of the 1985 Act.  
Thereafter, the BIFR after hearing the representatives and stakeholders 
declared the defendant company to be a sick company under Section 3(1)(o) 
of the 1985 Act vide its order dated 06.11.1992. The BIFR also granted FCIL 
and the Government of India time till 31.03.1993 to submit their final plan for 
rehabilitating the company.   
 
41.  During the entire period of adjudication of the suit by the trial court and for a 
part of the period during the pendency of the appeals before the High Court, 
the defendant company continued to remain a Sick Industrial company with a 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 20 of 91 
Special Director appointed by the BIFR and the SBI appointed as the 
Operating Agency.   
 
42.  On 09.05.2013, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (“CCEA”) met 
and took decisions on the revival of the defendant company. The Government 
of India waived off its loan and interest amounting to Rs. 10,643/- crore and 
the debt owed to the other PSUs were settled at 30% of their respective dues 
as on 31.03.2003.  
 
43.  Meanwhile, the BIFR in the course of one important hearing looked into the 
progress towards the revival of the defendant company in detail. After taking 
into account the developments over the course of 20 years, the BIFR issued 
the following relevant directions: - 
“i. The company, M/s Fertilizer Corpn. Of India (Case No. 
515/1992) ceases to be a Sick Industrial Company, within the 
meaning of Section 3(1)(o) of the SICA as its net-worth has turned 
positive. It is therefore, de-registered from the purview of 
SICA/BIFR. 
xxx 
 
xxx   
xxx 
iv. The Board discharges the State Bank of India from the 
responsibility of Operating Agency (OA) to the Board. 
v. All Secured Creditors, Statutory Authorities are at liberty to 
recover their dues, if any, according to law.”  
 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 21 of 91 
44.  Thus, in view of the directions of the BIFR dated 27.06.2013 referred to 
above, the defendant company ceased to be a Sick Industrial company during 
the pendency of the appeals before the High Court.  
 
45.  The submissions of the original defendants were focussed on and limited to 
the following two aspects – jurisdictional bar on the civil court in deciding the 
suit instituted by the original plaintiff by virtue of Section 22(1) of the 1985 
Act; and the legality & validity of the interest rate of 24% per annum awarded 
by the High Court in the original plaintiff’s favour.   
 
ii. 
Issues for Determination  
 
46.  Having heard the parties extensively on the aforesaid aspects and having 
perused the materials on record, the following two questions fall for our 
consideration:  
I. 
Whether the suspension of legal proceedings as envisaged under 
Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act would extend to a civil suit for recovery 
of money even if the debt sought to be proved in the plaint has not been 
admitted by the sick industrial company? If so, whether the decree in 
favour of the original plaintiff could be said to be coram non-judice?  
II. 
Whether the High Court was correct in granting 24% compound interest 
on the principal decretal amount in favour of the original plaintiff?

iii. 
Overview of Industrial Sickness and the Legislative Scheme of the 
1985 Act. 
 
47.  Before we proceed to answer the aforesaid issues, we would like to discuss 
briefly the concept of industrial sickness, the legislative scheme of the 1985 
Act and the object behind its enactment. This will help us develop a better 
contextual understanding of the questions before us.  
 
48.  Sickness in industries is a natural fall-out of industrialisation. Industrial 
sickness can be understood to refer to a situation wherein an industrial unit 
fails to generate surplus and is incurring losses over a period of time resulting 
in the erosion of its net-worth. Section 3(o) of the 1985 Act defines a ‘sick 
industrial company’ to be one which at the end of a financial year accumulates 
losses equal to or exceeding its net worth.  
 
49.  While there could be numerous causes of sickness, the mismanagement of the 
industrial unit, faulty planning at the inception of an industry, technical 
drawbacks, recession in the market, labour disputes, changes in the fiscal 
policies of the government, unavailability of credit facilities, and non-
availability of raw-materials are some of the prominent factors causing 
industrial sickness. 
 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 23 of 91 
50.  As the Indian economy transitioned from being an agriculture-intensive one 
towards a more industry-centric one, a growing number of industries suffered 
huge financial losses resulting in their closure, which in turn led to the loss of 
employment, government revenue and locking up of the investible funds of 
banks and financial institutions which were invested in setting up of those 
industries. In order to curb industrial sickness and its detrimental impacts on 
the Indian economy, many policies and legislations were enacted over the 
years by the executive and the legislative wing respectively. The aim of such 
enactments was two-fold – first, to reduce the incidence of sickness in 
industries by promoting a conducive industrial climate and secondly, to 
identify sick companies and take effective remedial steps for revival of such 
companies and upon failure, to wind them up. 
  
51.  One of the first such enactments was the Industrial Development and 
Regulation Act, 1951 (“IDRA Act, 1951”) which contained provisions 
empowering the Central Government to cause investigation into the affairs of 
an Industrial Company which is to be wound up for the purpose of reviving 
such Company in the interest of general public by ensuring production, supply 
or distribution of articles.  
 
52.  Nationalisation of sick industries through legislations was another approach 
adopted by the government to revive or continue the operation of sick 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 24 of 91 
industries in national interest. An enactment brought in with the object of 
dealing with sickness in the textile industry was the Sick Textile Undertaking 
(Nationalization) Act, 1974 which, inter alia, provided for the reorganisation 
and rehabilitation of sick textile industries. Similarly, The Aluminium 
Corporation of India Ltd. (Acquisition and Transfer of Aluminium 
Undertaking) Act, 1984 and The Futwah Islampur Lightway Line 
(Nationalisation) Act, 1985 were enacted with similar objects.   
 
53.  Industrial Reconstruction Bank of India Act, 1984 was enacted to provide 
financial assistance to sick industrial companies for their revival. However, 
the said enactment was repealed thereafter.  
 
54.  In 1981, the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) appointed a committee under the 
chairmanship of late Shri T. Tiwari to look into the causes of industrial 
sickness, to assess the depth of the problem and to suggest comprehensive and 
focussed remedial measures to counter the problem of industrial sickness in 
India. The committee submitted its report suggesting, inter alia, the setting up 
of a quasi-judicial body through a special legislation to handle the cases of 
industrial sickness. This suggestion of the committee led to the enactment of 
the 1985 Act.  
 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 25 of 91 
55.  The Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the Sick Industrial 
Companies Bill, 1985 reads as follows:  
 
“The ill effects of sickness in industrial companies such as loss of 
production, loss of employment, loss of revenue to the Central and 
State Governments and locking up of investible funds of banks and 
financial institutions are of serious concern to the Government and 
the society at large. The concern of the Government is accentuated 
by the alarming increase in the incidence of sickness in industrial 
companies. It has been recognised that in order to fully utilise the 
productive industrial assets, afford maximum protection of 
employment and optimise the use of the funds of the banks and 
financial institutions, it would be imperative to revive and 
rehabilitate the potentially viable sick industrial companies as 
quickly as possible. It would also be equally imperative to salvage 
the productive assets and realise the amounts due to the banks and 
financial institutions, to the extent possible, from the non-viable 
sick industrial companies through liquidation of those companies. 
 
2. It has been the experience that the existing institutional 
arrangements and procedures for revival and rehabilitation of 
potentially viable sick industrial companies are both inadequate 
and time-consuming. A multiplicity of laws and agencies makes the 
adoption of coordinated approach for dealing with sick industrial 
companies difficult. A need has, therefore, been felt to enact in 
public interest a legislation to provide for timely determination by 
a body of experts of the preventive, ameliorative, remedial and 
other measures that would need to be adopted with respect to such 
companies and for enforcement of the measures considered 
appropriate with utmost practicable despatch. 
 
3. The salient features of the Bill are- 
(i) Application of the legislation to the industries specified in the 
First Schedule to the Industries (Development and Regulation) 
Act. 1951, with the initial exception of the scheduled industry 
relating to ships and other vessels drawn by power, which may 
however be brought within the ambit of the legislation in due 
course: 
 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 26 of 91 
(ii) identification of sickness in an industrial company, registered 
for not less than seven years, on the basis of the symptomatic 
indices of cash losses for two consecutive financial years and 
accumulated losses equalling or exceeding the net worth of the 
company as at the end of the second financial year, 
 
(iii) the onus of reporting sickness and impending sickness at the 
stage of erosion of fifty per cent, or more of the net worth of an 
industrial company is being laid on the Board of Directors of such 
company; where the Central Government or the Reserve Bank is 
satisfied that an industrial company has become sick, it may make 
a reference to the Board, likewise if any State Government, 
scheduled bank or public financial institution having an interest in 
an industrial company is satisfied that the industrial company has 
become sick, it may also make a reference to the Board; 
 
(iv) establishment of Board consisting of experts in various 
relevant fields with powers to enquire into and determine the 
incidence of sickness in industrial companies and devise suitable 
remedial measures through appropriate schemes or other 
proposals and for proper implementation thereof; 
 
v) constitution of an Appellate Authority consisting of persons who 
are or have been Supreme Court Judges, senior High Court Judges 
and Secretaries to the Government of India, etc. for hearing 
appeals against the order of the Board. 
4. The notes on clauses appended to the Bill explain the various 
provisions of the Bill.

56.  The preamble to the 1985 Act reads as follows:  
“An Act to make, in the public interest, special provisions with a 
view to securing the timely detection of sick and potentially sick 
companies 
owning 
industrial 
undertakings, 
the 
speedy 
determination by a Board of experts of the preventive, 
ameliorative, remedial and other measures which need to be taken 
with respect to such companies and the expeditious enforcement of 
the measures so determined and for matters connected therewith 
or incidental thereto.”

57.  Having discussed the object behind the enactment of the 1985 Act and the 
developments leading up to its inception, we shall now briefly discuss the 
scheme and scope of the 1985 Act.  
 
58.  The 1985 Act is divided into four chapters. The first chapter contains 
preliminary provisions including the definitions and a declaration that the 
1985 Act is enacted in furtherance of the principles enshrined in clauses (b) 
and (c) of the Article 39 of the Constitution. The second chapter, inter alia, 
provides for the establishment of the BIFR and the AAIFR and prescribes the 
term of office and conditions of service of their chairperson and members and 
also the procedure to be followed by them.  
 
59.  The third chapter, which is often described as the soul and essence of the 1985 
Act, provides for the methodology that is to be adopted for the purposes of 
detecting, reviving or even winding up a sick industrial company. Section 15 
enables the Board of Directors of a company which has become sick to make 
reference to BIFR for determination of measures which shall be adopted with 
respect to the company. The Central Government or the Reserve Bank or the 
State Government concerned may also make the reference to the BIFR for the 
same purpose if it has sufficient reasons to believe that a company has become 
sick. Once a reference is made, it is open to the BIFR to conduct an inquiry 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 28 of 91 
for determining whether the company has become sick. If the BIFR is satisfied 
on completion of the inquiry that the company has become sick, it can adopt 
any of the measures envisaged in Section 17 of the 1985 Act. When an order 
is made under Section 17 a scheme with respect to the company shall be 
prepared by “the operating agency” specified in such order under Section 18. 
The operating agency may also be directed by the BIFR under Section 21 to 
prepare, inter alia, an inventory of the books of account of the sick company 
and its assets and liabilities, a list of shareholders and secured and unsecured 
creditors, a valuation report in respect of the shares and the assets etc. Section 
20 provides for the winding up of a sick company where the BIFR is of the 
opinion that such a company is not likely to become viable in the future. 
Section 22, which is at the heart of the dispute before us, inter alia, provides 
for the suspension of legal proceedings of the nature as specified in the said 
section.    
 
60.  The fourth chapter, among other things, provides for the detection of 
potentially sick companies in the initial stages by mandating the Board of 
Directors of such companies to bring such potential sickness to the knowledge 
of the BIFR and the shareholders of the companies. Punishment of up to two 
years imprisonment along with fine is also prescribed in case of default in 
complying with the requirement. The issue of mismanagement leading to 
sickness in companies is sought to be dealt with under Section 24 of the 1985 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 29 of 91 
Act which provides strict measures in case of proved misfeasance, breach of 
trust, etc. Section 26 bars the jurisdiction of civil courts in respect of matters 
which the BIFR or the AAIFR are empowered to determine. Section 32 is the 
non-obstante provision which imparts overriding effect to the 1985 Act over 
other laws in force except for the two legislations mentioned in the said section 
itself. The 1985 Act was repealed by the Sick Industrial Companies (Special 
Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003 which was notified on 01.12.2016.   
 
61.  Having discussed in detail the scheme of the 1985 Act and the object and 
purpose behind its enactment, we shall now proceed to answer the issues 
framed by us.  
iv. 
ISSUE NO. 1: Whether the suspension of legal proceedings as envisaged 
under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act would extend to a civil suit for 
recovery of money even if the debt sought to be proved in the plaint 
has not been admitted by the sick industrial company? If so, whether 
the decree in favour of the original plaintiff could be said to be coram 
non-judice?  
62.  To answer the issue before us, it is important to first delineate the scope of the 
relevant provision, which is reproduced hereinbelow:  
“22. Suspension of legal proceedings, contracts, etc.—  
(1) Where in respect of an industrial company, an inquiry under 
section 16 is pending or any scheme referred to under section 17 
is under preparation or consideration or a sanctioned scheme is 
under implementation or where an appeal under section 25 
relating 
to 
an 
industrial 
company 
is 
pending, 
then, 
notwithstanding anything contained in the Companies Act, 1956 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 30 of 91 
(1 of 1956) or any other law or the memorandum and articles of 
association of the industrial company or any other instrument 
having effect under the said Act or other law, no proceedings for 
the winding up of the industrial company or for execution, distress 
or the like against any of the properties of the industrial company 
or for the appointment of a receiver in respect thereof and no suit 
for the recovery of money or for the enforcement of any security 
against the industrial company or of any guarantee in respect of 
any loans or advance granted to the industrial company shall lie 
or be proceeded with further, except with the consent of the Board 
or, as the case may be, the Appellate Authority….” 
 
 
63.  Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act provides that subject to the fulfilment of the 
conditions as described in the sub-section, proceedings of the nature 
mentioned therein shall remain suspended in respect of a sick industrial 
company.  
 
64.  For the bar under the said sub-section to get attracted, it is necessary that in 
respect of an industrial company:  
I. 
An inquiry under Section 16 of the 1985 Act is pending; OR  
II. 
A scheme under Section 17 of the 1985 Act is under preparation or 
consideration; OR 
III. 
A sanctioned scheme is under implementation; OR 
IV. 
An appeal under Section 25 of the 1985 Act is pending.  
 
65.  If one of the four conditions as mentioned aforesaid is fulfilled, then 
notwithstanding anything contained in the Companies Act, 1956 or any other 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 31 of 91 
law or the memorandum and articles of association of the industrial company 
or any other instrument having effect under the Companies Act, 1956 or other 
law, proceedings in the nature of the following cannot be initiated, and if 
already initiated, cannot be proceeded with, except with the consent of the 
BIFR or the AAIFR, as the case may be:  
I. 
Winding up of the industrial company; 
II. 
Execution, distress or the like against any of the properties of the 
industrial company; 
III. 
Appointment of receiver in respect of any of the properties of the 
industrial company; 
IV. 
Suit for recovery of money from the industrial company; 
V. 
Suit for enforcement of a security against the industrial company; 
VI. 
Suit for enforcement of a guarantee in respect of loans or advance 
granted to the industrial company.  
 
66.  It is pertinent to mention that prior to the coming into force of the Sick 
Industrial Companies (Amendment) Act, 1993 w.e.f. 01.02.1994, the 
proceedings in the nature of a suit as mentioned in (iv), (v) and (vi) in 
paragraph 65 above were exempt from the ambit of the suspension as 
envisaged under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.  
 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 32 of 91 
67.  Thus, as can be seen from the plain reading of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act, 
for an industrial company to avail the benefit of suspension of legal 
proceedings, two conditions have to be fulfilled – First, one of the four 
requirements as mentioned in paragraph 64 should be satisfied, that is, the 
industrial company must be at the prescribed stage of proceedings before the 
BIFR or the AAIFR. Secondly, the nature of proceedings sought to be 
suspended should be one which falls within the ambit of proceedings 
mentioned in paragraph 65 above.  
 
68.  We shall first examine whether the first of the two conditions as mentioned 
above is satisfied, as the protective shield of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act is 
only available so long as the proceedings before the BIFR or the AAIFR are 
pending. It was observed by a three-judge bench of this Court in Shree 
Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. v. Church of South India Trust Association CSI 
CINOD Secretariat, Madras reported in (1992) 3 SCC 1 thus: 
“….We are, therefore, of the opinion that the passing of the interim 
order dated February 21, 1991 by the Delhi High Court staying the 
operation of the order of the Appellate Authority dated January 7, 
1991 does not have the effect of reviving the appeal which had been 
dismissed by the Appellate Authority by its order dated January 7, 
1991 and it cannot be said that after February 21, 1991, the said 
appeal stood revived and was pending before the Appellate Authority. 
In that view of the matter, it cannot be said that any proceedings under 
the Act were pending before the Board or the Appellate Authority on 
the date of the passing of the order dated August 14, 1991 by the 
learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court for winding up of 
the company or on November 6, 1991 when the Division Bench passed 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 33 of 91 
the order dismissing O.S.A. No. 16 of 1991 filed by the appellant-
company against the order of the learned Single Judge dated August 
14, 1991. Section 22(1) of the Act could not, therefore, be invoked and 
there was no impediment in the High Court dealing with the winding 
up petition filed by the respondents…” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
69.  As discussed hereinbefore in paragraph 40 of the judgment, the Board of 
Directors of the defendant company, passed a resolution dated 20.04.1992 to 
the effect that the company had become a sick company for the purposes of 
the 1985 Act and thus a reference to the BIFR was required to be made. In 
accordance with the resolution, a reference was accordingly made under 
Section 15(1) of the 1985 Act. Subsequently, a bench of the BIFR took up the 
reference of the defendant company for consideration and vide order dated 
06.11.1992, inter alia, decided that the company fulfilled all the criteria 
prescribed under Section 3(1)(o) of the 1985 Act for being declared a sick 
company. The bench also granted the defendant company and the Government 
of India time till 31.03.1993 to submit a proposal for rehabilitation of the 
company for the consideration of the bench.   
 
70.  The defendant company continued to remain a sick company under the 1985 
Act and proceedings before the BIFR continued and it was only on 
27.06.2013, after a detailed consideration of the progress made by the 
company towards revival, that the BIFR declared the defendant company to 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 34 of 91 
have ceased to be a sick industrial company. Consequently, the defendant 
company was deregistered from BIFR on the said date.  
 
71.  It is the case of the original defendants that the original civil suit for the 
recovery of money having been filed against the defendant company during 
the pendency of proceedings before the BIFR, the trial court committed an 
error in deciding the suit despite the statutory bar as envisaged under Section 
22(1) of the 1985 Act.  
 
72.  From a perusal of the facts as discussed above, it is clear that the civil suit 
was instituted by the original plaintiff on 21.11.1996, that is, indeed, during 
the pendency of the proceedings in respect of the defendant company before 
the BIFR. Thus, the first condition precedent for the applicability of the 
restriction under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act being satisfied, the only aspect 
that is now required to be determined is whether the suit instituted by the 
original plaintiff was of a nature as contemplated under Section 22(1).  
 
73.  From a bare reading of the provision, it appears that any ‘suit for recovery of 
money’ against a sick industrial company shall not lie or be proceeded with 
during the pendency of the proceedings in respect of such a company before 
the BIFR or the AAIFR, except with the permission of the BIFR or the AAIFR, 
as the case may be. However, it has been contended by the original plaintiff 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 35 of 91 
that it is not a suit for recovery of money simpliciter is not barred under the 
provision, and only such suits for recovery of money which are instituted 
towards recovery of liabilities admitted by the sick company before the BIFR 
that fall within the protective ambit of Section 22(1).  
 
74.  In other words, the contention of the original plaintiff is that if a suit for 
recovery of money is brought against a sick company during the pendency of 
proceedings before the BIFR or the AAIFR with respect to the recovery of an 
acknowledged debt, then such a suit will be hit by Section 22(1) and cannot 
lie or be proceeded with except with the permission of the BIFR or the AAIFR, 
as the case may be.  
 
75.  This Court including many of the High Courts have had the occasion of 
interpreting Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. One of the earliest decisions 
concerning Section 22(1) was rendered by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in 
Gram Panchayat and Another v. Shree Vallabh Glass Works Limited and 
Others reported in (1990) 2 SCC 440. In the said case, while deciding an 
appeal against the decision of the Bombay High Court quashing recovery 
proceedings towards property taxes and other amounts due under the 
provisions of the Bombay Village Panchayat Act, 1959 against the respondent 
company therein, which had been declared to be a sick company under the 
Act, the Bench held:  

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 36 of 91 
“5. The question is whether the Panchayat could not recover the 
amount due to it from out of the properties of the sick industrial 
company without the consent of the Board? 
 
 
xxx 
 
xxx   
xxx 
7. Section 22(1) provides that in case the enquiry under Section 16 
is pending or any scheme referred to under Section 17 is under 
preparation or consideration by the Board or any appeal under 
Section 25 is pending then certain proceedings against the sick 
industrial company are to be suspended or presumed to be 
suspended. The nature of the proceedings which are automatically 
suspended are: (1) Winding up of the industrial company; (2) 
Proceedings for execution, distress or the like against the 
properties of sick industrial company; and (3) Proceedings for the 
appointment of receiver. The proceedings in respect of these 
matters could, however, be continued against the sick industrial 
company with the consent or approval of the Board or of the 
appellate authority as the case may be. 
 
 
xxx 
 
xxx   
xxx 
10. In the light of the steps taken by the Board under Sections 16 
and 17 of the Act, no proceedings for execution, distress or the like 
proceedings against any of the properties of the company shall lie 
or be proceeded further except with the consent of the Board. 
Indeed, there would be automatic suspension of such proceedings 
against the company's properties. As soon as the inquiry under 
Section 16 is ordered by the Board, the various proceedings set 
out under sub-section (1) of Section 22 would be deemed to have 
been suspended. 
 
11. It may be against the principles of equity if the creditors are 
not allowed to recover their dues from the company, but such 
creditors may approach the Board for permission to proceed 
against 
the 
company 
for 
the 
recovery 
of 
their 
dues/outstandings/overdues or arrears by whatever name it is 
called. The Board at its discretion may accord its approval for 
proceeding against the company. If the approval is not granted, 
the remedy is not extinguished. It is only postponed. Sub-section 
(5) of Section 22 provides for exclusion of the period during which 
the remedy is suspended while computing the period of limitation 
for recovering the dues.

12. In our opinion, the High Court was justified in quashing the 
recovery proceedings taken against the properties of the company 
and we accordingly, reject this petition, with no order as to costs.”

76.  One another decision interpreting Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act was delivered 
by a two-judge bench of this Court in Maharashtra Tubes Ltd. v. State 
Industrial & Investment Corpn. of Maharashtra Ltd. reported in (1993) 2 
SCC 144. In this case, this Court, while deciding the interplay between the 
power of recovery under the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951 and the 
suspension of certain legal proceedings under Section 22 of the 1985 Act, held 
thus:  
“10. It was next contended that the right conferred on the 
Financial Corporation by Section 29 of the 1951 Act is not a ‘legal 
proceeding’ but merely an action permitted by statute and, 
therefore, Section 22(1) will have no application as it only bars 
legal proceedings for the winding up of any industrial company or 
for execution, distress or the like against any of its properties or 
for the appointment of a Receiver in respect thereof. Now Section 
22(1) uses the expression ‘proceedings’ and not ‘legal 
proceedings’ which expression is albeit used in the marginal note 
to the said provision. Mr Rao contended that Section 22 must be 
read in the light of the marginal note and when so read it becomes 
obvious that only legal proceedings of the type mentioned in sub-
section (1) thereof are barred and not the exercise of a right such 
as the one conferred by Section 29 of the 1951 Act. In support of 
his contention that the marginal note can be used as an aid to 
interpretation he invited our attention to a seven-Judge Bench 
decision of this Court in Bengal Immunity Company Ltd. v. State 
of Bihar [(1955) 2 SCR 603, 636 : AIR 1955 SC 661 : (1955) 6 
STC 446] . In that case the marginal note to Article 286 of the 
Constitution was referred to and it was said that it furnished some 
clue as to the meaning and purpose of the Article. But at the same 
time the Court pointed out that unlike the marginal notes in the 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 38 of 91 
statutes of the British Parliament, the various Articles of the 
Constitution were passed by the Constituent Assembly with the 
marginal notes and, therefore, the Court considered it permissible 
to use the marginal note to understand the meaning and purport 
of the Article. But so far as statutes are concerned this Court in 
the case of Board of Muslim Wakfs, Rajasthan v. Radha 
Kishan [(1979) 2 SCC 468] held in no uncertain terms that the 
weight of the authority was in favour of the view that the marginal 
note appended to a section cannot be used for construing the 
section (see paragraph 24 at p. 479). Section 22(1) shorn of the 
irrelevant part provides that where an appeal under Section 25 
relating 
to 
an 
industrial 
company 
is 
pending, 
then, 
notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, no 
proceedings for the winding up of the industrial company or for 
execution, distress or the like against any of the properties of the 
industrial company or for appointment of a Receiver in respect 
thereof shall lie or be proceeded with further, except with the 
consent of the BIFR or, as the case may be, the appellate authority. 
The purpose and object of this provision is clearly to await the 
outcome of the reference made to the BIFR for the revival and 
rehabilitation of the sick industrial company. The words ‘or the 
like’ which follow the words ‘execution’ and ‘distress’ are clearly 
intended to convey that the properties of the sick industrial 
company shall not be made the subject-matter of coercive action 
of similar quality and characteristic till the BIFR finally disposes 
of the reference made under Section 15 of the said enactment. The 
legislature has advisedly used an omnibus expression ‘the like’ as 
it could not have conceived of all possible coercive measures that 
may be taken against a sick undertaking. The action contemplated 
by Section 29 of the 1951 Act is undoubtedly a coercive measure 
directed at the take over of the management and property of the 
industrial concern and confers a further right on the Financial 
Corporation to transfer by way of lease or sale the properties of 
the said concern and any such transfer effected by the Financial 
Corporation would vest in the transferee all rights in or to the 
transferred property as if the transfer was made by the owner of 
the property. So also under the said provision the Financial 
Corporation will have the same rights and powers with respect to 
goods manufactured or produced wholly or partly from goods 
forming part of the security held by it as it had with respect to the 
original goods. It is, therefore, obvious on a plain reading of 
Section 29 of the 1951 Act that it permits coercive action against 
the defaulting industrial concern of the type which would be taken 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 39 of 91 
in execution or distress proceedings; the only difference being that 
in the latter case the concerned party would have to use the forum 
prescribed by law for the purpose of securing attachment and sale 
of property of the defaulting industrial concern whereas in the 
case of a Financial Corporation that right is conferred on the 
creditor corporation itself which is permitted to take over the 
management and possession of the properties and deal with them 
as if it were the owner of the properties. If the Corporation is 
permitted to resort to the provision of Section 29 of the 1951 Act 
while proceedings under Sections 15 to 19 of the 1985 Act are 
pending it will render the entire process nugatory. In such a 
situation the law merely expects the corporation and for that 
matter any other creditor to obtain the consent of the BIFR or, as 
the case may be, the appellate authority to proceed against the 
industrial concern. The law has not left them without a remedy. 
We are, therefore, of the opinion that the word ‘proceedings’ in 
Section 22(1) cannot be given a narrow or restricted meaning to 
limit the same to legal proceedings. Such a narrow meaning would 
run counter to the scheme of the law and frustrate the very object 
and purpose of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
77.  The decisions in Gram Panchayat (supra) and Maharashtra Tubes (supra) 
considered the unamended Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. However, the said 
provision came to be amended by the Sick Industrial Companies 
(Amendment) Act, 1994 which came into effect from 01.02.1994. The suit in 
question before us having been filed in 1996, it is the amended Section 22(1) 
which would apply. Thus, we shall now look into some of the decisions 
wherein the amended Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act was interpreted.  
 
78.  The question whether proceedings for the recovery of dues arising after the 
sanctioning of the scheme would also be covered under the protective 
umbrella of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act fell for the consideration of a two-

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 40 of 91 
judge bench of this Court in Deputy Commercial Tax Officer and Others v. 
Corromandal Pharmaceuticals and Others reported in (1997) 10 SCC 649. 
This Court, while answering the issue in the negative, distinguished the facts 
before it from the decisions in Gram Panchayat (supra) and Maharashtra 
Tubes (supra) and held thus:  
“13. On a fair reading of the provisions contained in Chapter III 
of Act 1 of 1986 and in particular Sections 15 to 22, we are of the 
opinion that the plea put forward by the Revenue is reasonable 
and fair in all the circumstances of the case. Under the statute, the 
BIFR is to consider in what way various preventive or remedial 
measures should be afforded to a sick industrial company. In that 
behalf, BIFR is enabled to frame an appropriate scheme. To 
enable the BIFR to do so, certain preliminaries are required to be 
followed. It starts with the reference to be made by the Board of 
Directors of the sick company. The BIFR is directed to make 
appropriate inquiry as provided in Sections 16 and 17 of the Act. 
At the conclusion of the inquiry, after notice and opportunity 
afforded to various persons including the creditors, the BIFR is to 
prepare a scheme which shall come into force on such date as it 
may specify in that behalf. It is in implementation of the 
scheme wherein various preventive, remedial or other measures 
are designed for the sick industrial company, steps by way of 
giving financial assistance etc. by Government, banks or other 
institutions, are contemplated. In other words, the scheme is 
implemented or given effect to, by affording financial assistance 
by way of loans, advances or guarantees or reliefs or concessions 
or sacrifices by Government, banks, public financial institutions 
and other authorities. In order to see that the scheme is 
successfully implemented and no impediment is caused for the 
successful carrying out of the scheme, the Board is enabled to have 
a say when the steps for recovery of the amounts or other coercive 
proceedings are taken against sick industrial company which, 
during the relevant time, acts under the guidance/control or 
supervision of the Board (BIFR). Any step for execution, distress 
or the like against the properties of the industrial company or 
other similar steps should not be pursued which will cause delay 
or impediment in the implementation of the sanctioned scheme. In 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 41 of 91 
order to safeguard such state of affairs, an embargo or bar is 
placed under Section 22 of the Act against any step for execution, 
distress or the like or other similar proceedings against the 
company without the consent of the Board or, as the case may be, 
the appellate authority. The language of Section 22 of the Act is 
certainly wide. But, in the totality of the circumstances, the 
safeguard is only against the impediment, that is likely to be 
caused in the implementation of the scheme. If that be so, only the 
liability or amounts covered by the scheme will be taken in, by 
Section 22 of the Act. So, we are of the view that though the 
language of Section 22 of the Act is of wide import regarding 
suspension of legal proceedings from the moment an inquiry is 
started, till after the implementation of the scheme or the disposal 
of an appeal under Section 25 of the Act, it will be reasonable to 
hold that the bar or embargo envisaged in Section 22(1) of the Act 
can apply only to such of those dues reckoned or included in the 
sanctioned scheme. Such amounts like sales tax, etc., which the 
sick industrial company is enabled to collect after the date of the 
sanctioned scheme legitimately belonging to the Revenue, cannot 
be and could not have been intended to be covered within Section 
22 of the Act. Any other construction will be unreasonable and 
unfair and will lead to a state of affairs enabling the sick industrial 
unit to collect amounts due to the Revenue and withhold it 
indefinitely and unreasonably. Such a construction which is 
unfair, unreasonable and against the spirit of the statute in a 
business sense, should be avoided. 
 
14. The situation which has arisen in this case seems to be rather 
exceptional. The issue that has arisen in this appeal did not arise 
for consideration in the two cases decided by this Court in Gram 
Panchayat v. Shree Vallabh Glass Works Ltd. [(1990) 2 SCC 440] 
and Maharashtra Tubes Ltd. v. State Industrial & Investment 
Corpn. of Maharashtra Ltd. [(1993) 2 SCC 144] It does not 
appear from the above two decisions of this Court nor from the 
decisions of the various High Courts brought to our notice, that in 
any one of them, the liability of the sick company dealt with therein 
itself arose, for the first time after the date of sanctioned scheme. 
At any rate, in none of those cases, a situation arose whereby the 
sick industrial unit was enabled to collect tax due to the Revenue 
from the customers after the “sanctioned scheme” but the sick unit 
simply folded its hands and declined to pay it over to the Revenue, 
for which proceedings for recovery, had to be taken. The two 
decisions of this Court as also the decisions of High Courts 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 42 of 91 
brought to our notice are, therefore, distinguishable. They will not 
apply to a situation as has arisen in this case. We are, therefore, 
of the opinion that Section 22(1) should be read down or 
understood as contended by the Revenue. The decision to the 
contrary by the High Court is unreasonable and unsustainable. 
We set aside the judgment of the High Court and allow this appeal. 
There shall be no order as to costs.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
79.  The decision in Corromandal Pharmaceuticals (supra) was referred to and 
relied upon by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Jay Engineering (supra) 
which set aside the order of the High Court as it failed to consider that the 
liabilities of the appellant-sick company therein with respect to the creditor 
were indisputably a part of the revised rehabilitation scheme. This Court held 
that if the liabilities of the creditor were duly considered and made a part of 
the rehabilitation scheme, the bar under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act would 
apply, notwithstanding the fact that the liabilities arose after the company was 
declared to be a sick one. The relevant observations of this court are extracted 
hereinbelow:  
“9. In the said scheme, the award made in favour of the 
respondents finds place in the category of “dormant creditors”. 
The liabilities of the appellant vis-à-vis Respondent 2 were, 
therefore, indisputably a subject-matter of the said scheme. The 
High Court, in our opinion, committed an error in proceeding on 
the premise that the awarded amount had not been included and 
could not be included in the sanctioned rehabilitation scheme, the 
same being part of transactions which took place after 21-11-1997 
ignoring the revised scheme made in the year 2003.

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 43 of 91 
18. The award of the Council being an award, deemed to have 
been made under the provisions of the 1996 Act, indisputably is 
being executed before a civil court. Execution of an award, beyond 
any cavil of doubt, would attract the provisions of Section 22 of 
the 1985 Act. Whereas an adjudicatory process of making an 
award under the 1993 Act may not come within the purview of the 
1985 Act but once an award made is sought to be executed, it shall 
come into play. Once the awarded amount has been included in 
the scheme approved by the Board, in our opinion, Section 22 of 
the 1985 Act would apply. 
 
19. If the liabilities of the appellant are covered by the scheme 
framed under Section 22 of the 1985 Act, the High Court was 
clearly in error in coming to the conclusion that the provisions 
thereof are not attracted only because the debt had been incurred 
after the Company was declared to be a sick one.

22. The 
High 
Court 
has 
placed 
strong 
reliance 
on CTO v. Corromandal Pharmaceuticals [(1997) 10 SCC 649] 
wherein this Court was considering an exceptional situation by 
reason of the fact that the liability of the sick company for the first 
time arose after the date of sanctioned scheme and the sick 
industrial unit was enabled to collect tax due to the Revenue from 
the exporters thereafter but declined to pay it over to the Revenue 
wherefor recovery proceedings had to be taken. This Court 
categorically opined that there cannot be any impediment in the 
enforcement of the scheme. Section 22 of the 1985 Act provides for 
a safeguard against impediment that is likely to be caused in the 
implementation of the scheme. Section 22 was also held to be of 
wide import as regards suspension of legal proceedings from the 
moment, the inquiry is started till after the implementation of the 
scheme or disposal of the scheme under Section 25 of the 1985 Act. 
It was categorically held: 
“… it will be reasonable to hold that the bar or embargo 
envisaged in Section 22(1) of the Act can apply only to such of 
those dues reckoned or included in the sanctioned scheme….” 
 
The ratio laid down in the said decision, therefore, instead of 
assisting the respondent assists the appellant.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 44 of 91 
80.  The original defendants have strongly relied upon the decision of a two-judge 
bench of this Court in Bhoruka Textiles (supra). In the said case, the 
respondent therein, filed a suit for recovery against the appellant, a sick 
industrial company. The civil court decreed the suit in favour of the respondent 
therein with the finding that the transaction referred to took place subsequent 
to the reference of the appellant company to the BIFR and thus the suspension 
under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act would not apply. The civil court also held 
that in the absence of any final order declaring the appellant company as a sick 
company by the BIFR, mere reference of the said company to the BIFR would 
not bring the protection under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act into effect.  
 
81.  This Court negatived both the findings noted above and held that the civil 
court committed a manifest error in holding that the transaction in question 
was subsequent to the reference, when from the admitted facts it was apparent 
that it took place prior to the referral. It was observed by the Bench thus: 
“7. Chapter III of the Act provides for reference, enquiries and 
schemes. Section 15 of the Act provides for reference to the Board 
in terms whereof the Board of Directors of the company is 
required to make a reference within 60 days from the date of the 
duly audited accounts of the company for the financial year as at 
the end of which the company has become a sick industrial 
company. Such reference is made for determination of the 
measures which may be adopted with respect to the company. The 
proviso appended thereto, however, entitles the Board of 
Directors to make a reference within 60 days from the date of 
formation of the opinion that the company had become a sick 
industrial company before the audited accounts of the financial 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 45 of 91 
year in question are finalised. Section 16 of the Act empowers the 
Board to make such enquiry as it may deem fit for determining 
whether any industrial company has become a sick industrial 
company, inter alia, upon receipt of a reference with respect to 
such company under Section 15. 
 
 
xxx 
 
 
xxx 
 
 
xxx 
 
10. Section 22 of the Act must be interpreted giving a plain 
meaning to its contents. An enquiry in terms of Section 16 of the 
Act by the Board is permissible upon receipt of a reference. Thus, 
reference having been made on 27-12-2001 and the suit having 
been filed on 17-12-2002, the receipt of a reference must be held 
to be the starting period for proceeding with the enquiry. 
 
11. The effect of the provisions of the Act has been considered by 
a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Tata Motors 
Ltd. v. Pharmaceutical Products of India Ltd. [(2008) 7 SCC 619] 
wherein it, in no uncertain terms, held that SICA is a special 
statute and, thus, overrides other Acts like the Companies Act, 
1956, stating: (SCC p. 635, paras 31-33) 
“31. SICA furthermore was enacted to secure the principles 
specified in Article 39 of the Constitution of India. It seeks to 
give effect to the larger public interest. It should be given 
primacy because of its higher public purpose. Section 26 of 
SICA bars the jurisdiction of the civil courts. 
32. What scheme should be prepared by the operating agency 
for revival and rehabilitation of the sick industrial company is 
within the domain of BIFR. Section 26 not only covers orders 
passed under SICA but also any matter which BIFR is 
empowered to determine. 
33. The jurisdiction of the civil court is, thus, barred in respect 
of any matter for which the Appellate Authority or the Board is 
empowered. The High Court may not be a civil court but its 
jurisdiction in a case of this nature is limited.” 
  
12. If the civil court's jurisdiction was ousted in terms of the 
provisions of Section 22 of the Act, any judgment rendered by it 
would be coram non judice. It is a well-settled principle of law that 
a judgment and decree passed by a court or tribunal lacking 
inherent jurisdiction would be a nullity. In Kiran Singh v. Chaman 
Paswan [AIR 1954 SC 340] this Court held: (AIR p. 342, para 6) 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 46 of 91 
“6. … It is a fundamental principle well established that a 
decree passed by a court without jurisdiction is a nullity, and 
that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is 
sought to be enforced or relied upon, even at the stage of 
execution and even in collateral proceedings. A defect of 
jurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether it 
is in respect of the subject-matter of the action, strikes at the 
very authority of the court to pass any decree, and such a defect 
cannot be cured even by consent of parties.” 
(See also Chief Engineer, Hydel Project v. Ravinder Nath [(2008) 
2 SCC 350 : (2008) 1 SCC (L&S) 940] , SCC p. 361, para 26.)” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
82.  A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Raheja Universal Limited v. NRC 
Limited and Others reported in (2012) 4 SCC 148 undertook a comprehensive 
study of the various decisions of this Court on the interpretation of Section 22 
of the 1985 Act to clarify the divergences and settle the position of law on the 
said provision. The relevant observations are as follows:  
“23. The provisions of SICA 1985 impose an obligation on the sick 
industrial companies and potentially sick industrial companies to 
make references to BIFR within the time specified under SICA 
1985. Default thereof is punishable under the provisions of SICA 
1985. Largely, the proceedings before BIFR are specific to 
rehabilitation or winding up of the sick company and SICA 1985 
hardly contemplates adversarial proceedings. The bodies 
constituted under SICA 1985 would least exercise their 
jurisdiction to a lis between any party or upon the rival interests 
of the parties.

30. Dealing with the language of Section 22 of SICA 1985, this 
Court in Jay Engg. case [(2006) 8 SCC 677 : AIR 2006 SC 3252] 
took the view that the said Act shall prevail and though the 
adjudicatory process of making an award under the 1993 Act 
would not come under the purview of SICA 1985, once an award 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 47 of 91 
is made and sought to be executed, the provisions of Section 22 of 
SICA 1985 shall take over and such award would not be 
executable against the sick company, particularly when the party 
in whose favour the award was made was, as in the present case, 
included in the category of dormant creditors of the sick company. 
 
xxx 
 
 
xxx 
 
 
xxx 
 
48. All these provisions which fall under Chapter III of SICA 1985 
have to be read conjointly and that too, along with other relevant 
provisions and the scheme of SICA 1985. It is a settled canon of 
interpretation of statutes that the statute should not (sic) be 
construed in its entirety and a sub-section or a section therein 
should not be read and construed in isolation. Chapter III, in fact, 
is the soul and essence of SICA 1985 and it provides for the 
methodology that is to be adopted for the purposes of detecting, 
reviving or even winding up a sick industrial company. Provisions 
under SICA 1985 also provide for an appeal against the orders of 
BIFR before another specialised body i.e. Aaifr. To put it simply, 
this is a self-contained code and because of the non obstante 
provisions, contained therein, it has an overriding effect over the 
other laws. As per Section 32 of SICA 1985, the Act is required to 
be enforced with all its vigour and in precedence to other laws.

54. Firstly, the facts of these cases are different and distinct and, 
therefore, conclusions of the Court have to be read with reference 
to the facts of the respective cases only and not dehors thereof. 
Once the dictum of this Court is read with reference to the facts of 
the respective cases, it would be evident that there is no conflict of 
views within the ambit of ratio decidendi of the respective 
judgments to make both of them legal and binding precedents. 
 
55. Despite these judgments and with an intention to clarify the 
law, we would state that the matters which are connected with the 
sanctioning and implementation of the scheme right from the date 
on which it is presented or the date from which the scheme is made 
effective, whichever is earlier, would be the matters which 
squarely fall within the ambit and scope of Section 22 of SICA 
1985 subject to their satisfying the ingredients stated under that 
provision. This would include the proceedings before the civil 
court, Revenue Authorities and/or any other competent forum in 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 48 of 91 
the form of execution or distress in relation to recovery of amount 
by sale or otherwise of the assets of the sick industrial company. 
It is difficult for us to hold that merely because a demand by a 
creditor had not been made a part of the scheme, pre- or post-
sanctioning of the same for that reason alone, it would fall outside 
the ambit of protection of Section 22 of SICA 1985. 
 
xxx 
 
 
xxx 
 
 
xxx 
 
58. Section 22 is the reservoir of the statutory powers empowering 
BIFR to determine a scheme, right from its presentation till its 
complete implementation in accordance with law, free of 
interjections and interference from other judicial processes. 
Section 22(1) deals with the execution, distress or the like 
proceedings against the company's properties, including 
appointment of a Receiver. It also specifically provides that even 
a winding-up petition would not be instituted and no other 
proceedings shall lie or proceed further, except with the consent 
of BIFR. 
 
xxx 
 
 
xxx 
 
 
xxx 
 
61. It can safely be perceived that the provisions of Section 22 of 
SICA 1985 are self-explanatory. They would cease to operate 
within their own limitations and not by force of any other law, 
agreement, memorandum or even articles of association of the 
company. The purpose is so very clear that during the 
examination, finalisation and implementation of the scheme, there 
should be no impediment caused to the smooth execution of the 
scheme of revival of the sick industrial company. It is only when 
the specified period of restrictions and declarations contemplated 
under the provisions of SICA 1985 is over, that the status quo ante 
as it existed at the time of the consideration and finalisation of the 
scheme, would become operative. This is done primarily with the 
object that the assets of the company are not diverted, wasted, 
taken away and/or disposed of in any manner, during the relevant 
period. 
 
xxx 
 
 
xxx 
 
 
xxx 
 
69. Sections 22, 22-A, 26 and 32 have to be read and construed 
conjointly. A common thread of legislative intent to treat this law 
as a special law, in contradistinction to the other laws except the 
laws stated in the provisions and to ensure its effective 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 49 of 91 
implementation with utmost expeditiousness, runs through all 
these provisions. It also mandates that no injunction shall be 
granted by any court or authority in respect of an action taken or 
to be taken in pursuance of the powers conferred to or by under 
this Act. 
 
xxx 
 
 
xxx 
 
 
xxx 
 
78. The expression “no proceedings” that finds place in Section 
22(1) is of wide spectrum but is certainly not free of exceptions. 
The framers of law have given a definite meaning to the expression 
“proceedings” appearing under Section 22(1) of SICA 1985. 
These proceedings are for winding up of the industrial company 
or for execution, distress or the like against any of the properties 
of the industrial company or for the appointment of a Receiver in 
respect thereof. 
 
79. The expression “the like” has to be read ejusdem generis to 
the term “proceedings”. The words “execution, distress or the 
like” have a definite connotation. These proceedings can have the 
effect of nullifying or obstructing the sanctioning or 
implementation of the revival scheme, as contemplated under the 
provisions of SICA 1985. This is what is required to be avoided for 
effective implementation of the scheme. The other facet of the same 
section is that, no suit for recovery of money, or for enforcement 
of any security against the industrial company, or any guarantee 
in respect of any loan or advance granted to the industrial 
company shall lie, or be proceeded with further without the 
consent of BIFR. In other words, a suit for recovery and/or for the 
stated kind of reliefs cannot lie or be proceeded with further 
without the leave of BIFR. Again, the intention is to protect the 
properties/assets of the sick industrial company, which is the 
subject-matter of the scheme. 
 
80. It is difficult to state with precision the principle that would 
uniformly apply to all the proceedings/suits falling under Section 
22(1) of SICA 1985. Firstly, it will depend upon the facts and 
circumstances of a given case, it must satisfy the ingredients of 
Section 22(1) and fall under any of the various classes of 
proceedings stated thereunder. Secondly, these proceedings 
should have the impact of interfering with the formulation, 
consideration, finalisation or implementation of the scheme.”

83.  While the decisions in each of the aforesaid cases should be seen in the 
context of the specific factual situation therein, there is a common thread that 
binds them all together. All of the aforesaid decisions proceed on the footing 
that any proceeding which can possibly interfere with the formulation, 
consideration, finalisation or implementation of a rehabilitation scheme as 
envisaged under Chapter III of the Act, has to be suspended under Section 
22(1) of the 1985 Act.  
 
84.  It is the above purpose which the scheme of Section 22(1) seeks to achieve 
by suspending the proceedings of the nature either mentioned specifically in 
the provision, or the proceedings of a like nature. Although this Court has 
interpreted the provision liberally by widening the ambit of its protective 
umbrella, yet it has also been mindful to extend such protection only to such 
cases where the refusal to allow such extension would result in miscarriage of 
the very purpose of the Act, which is the expeditious revival of sick 
companies.  
 
85.  The ameliorative object of the 1985 Act, as envisaged by the legislature, is 
sought to be achieved, inter alia, by the smooth formulation and 
implementation of a rehabilitation scheme. Thus, if any impediment exists to 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 51 of 91 
the successful execution of the scheme, such an impediment is curtailed at the 
outset by the embargo provided under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.  
 
86.  It can be said without a cavil of doubt that the proceedings in the nature of 
execution or distress by way of appointment of receiver or attachment of 
immovable property, bank accounts, etc. would affect the assets of a sick 
company and may inevitably come in the way of the preparation or execution 
of the rehabilitation scheme. However, to hold that the protective shield of 
Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act would apply even to those proceedings which 
do not have any impact on the prospects of successful formulation and 
implementation of the scheme, and the possibility of revival of the sick 
company, would run contrary to the object of the Act, which was never to 
confer absolute immunity or impunity on the sick company.   
 
87.  Thus, as explained in paragraph 67 of this judgment, a perusal of the plain 
text of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act brings out only two conditions for the 
suspension of legal proceedings to operate. However, various decisions of this 
Court, by necessary implication, have read into the said provision a third 
condition which too has to be fulfilled before a sick company can seek 
protection of the said provision. This third condition is that for a legal 
proceeding to be suspended under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act, it should be 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 52 of 91 
shown to be interfering with the formulation, consideration, finalisation or 
implementation of a rehabilitation scheme.   
 
88.  A Single Judge of the Delhi High Court has explained very succinctly these 
conditions in Goyal MG Gases Pvt. Ltd. v. SBQ Steels Ltd. reported in 2016 
SCC OnLine Del 5100 thus:  
“25. The applicability of embargo contained in Section 22(1) of 
SICA requires the cumulative and conjoint satisfaction of two 
conditions; namely; a) the proceeding sought to be suspended 
should clearly satisfy the ingredients of Section 22(1) and fall 
within one or more of the categories of proceedings indicated in 
the said provision and b) additionally, the continuance of the 
proceeding should have the impact of interfering with the 
formulation of the scheme. 
 
26. The Supreme Court has also made it clear that the 
applicability of the embargo contained in Section 22(1) of SICA 
depends on the facts and circumstances of each individual case; 
and no principle of universal application can be laid down in all 
such matters. 
 
27. The use of the expressions “Firstly” and “Secondly”, in para 
80 of Raheja Universal Ltd. (supra) would make it clear that both 
the conditions given in the judgment have to be satisfied 
cumulatively. Even if the suit/proceeding is of the category 
contemplated in Section 22(1), that by itself will not attract the bar 
contained in the said provision, unless it additionally has the 
impact of “interfering with the formulation, consideration, 
finalisation or implementation of the scheme.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
89.  A Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in Saketh India (supra) considered 
the scope of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act in the context of the object sought 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 53 of 91 
to be achieved by it and held that the term ‘suit for recovery’ as it appears in 
the said provision must be construed ejusdem generis, meaning thereby that 
only such a suit for recovery which is in the nature of execution or any other 
coercive enforcement will be suspended by the effect of the provision. The 
relevant parts of the said decision are extracted hereinbelow:  
“5. We think it appropriate, however, to consider the provision of 
SICA and analyse what it endeavours to achieve. We must 
immediately take note of the fact that SICA has been repealed by 
Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003. 
While it is yet to be notified, it is significant that provisions akin to 
Section 22 are conspicuous by their absence in the new Scheme of 
revival of sick companies inserted in form of Part VIA, namely, 
“Revival and Rehabilitation of Sick Industrial Companies”. 
Obviously, empirical analysis discloses that more often than not 
companies which have sought shelter of SICA have done so to 
procrastinate, delay and defer clearing its liability, with the 
obvious intention of coercing creditors into unfair settlements 
rather than implementing projected schemes supposed to assist in 
their reconstruction. When the statute is notified, amendments to 
the Companies Act, 1956 will become effective and all proceedings 
pending before BIFR will stand abated. To some extent, therefore, 
the present controversy has been rendered academic. 
 
6. Courts, however, have always been alive to the possible 
mischief that invocation of SICA can lead to. In a nutshell, where 
the not worth of a company is reduced to a negative, and the 
amelioration that is sought is for reviving the company rather than 
winding it up, the recourse to the Act would be legitimate. There 
is no justifiable reason, therefore, for all legal proceedings to be 
immediately even held in abeyance, if not dismissed. We are 
mindful of the fact that Parliament has incorporated an 
amendment in the Section with effect from 1.2.1994 in these words 
— “no suit for the recovery of money or for the enforcement of any 
security against the industrial company or of any guarantee in 
respect of any loans or advance granted to the industrial company 
— shall lie or be proceeded with-further, except with the consent 
of the Board, or as the case may be, the Appellate Authority”. It 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 54 of 91 
appears to us that the phrase “recovery of money” must be 
construed ejusdem generis and accordingly recovery proceedings 
in the nature of execution or any other coercive enforcement that 
has been ordained to be not maintainable. We do not find any logic 
in holding legal proceedings to be not maintainable, or to be liable 
to be halted unless, even if the debt sought to be proved in the 
Plaint has not been admitted. Given the delays presently endemic 
in the justice delivery system if a creditor is disallowed even from 
proving the indebtedness of a recalcitrant debtor SICA company, 
it would cause unjustified hardship. Whichever way we look at the 
matter, there can be no logic in denying legal recourse to a party 
for proving its debt. In the event that at least the principal amount, 
or a substantial part of it stands admitted, either in the suit or by 
means of a mention in the Scheme placed before the BIFR, the 
aggrieved party must be permitted to prove its claim. In holding 
so, the only prejudice that we can conceive of is incurring 
expenditure in legal fees. When this is weighed against the 
interests of a person claiming that the company is indebted to it, 
the balance tilts in favour of the latter. A holistic reading of 
Section 22(1) of SICA makes it manifestly clear that Parliament's 
intention was to insulate sick companies only against proceedings 
for winding-up or for execution, or distress or the like or for 
enforcement of any security or guarantee. In the case in hand, 
despite several opportunities granted to the Appellant, it has 
miserably and perhaps deliberately failed to substantiate that the 
claim mentioned in the Suit has been reflected in the Scheme 
placed before the BIFR but even more poignantly, that a scheme 
was, in fact, pending before BIFR. If an Appeal is pending, has 
BIFR failed to grant or has withdrawn registration under SICA. 
We see the conduct of the Appellant as nothing more than an abuse 
of SICA. 
 
7. The 
Apex 
Court 
has 
in Deputy 
Commercial 
Tax 
Officer v. Corromandal Pharmaceuticals, (1997) 10 SCC 649 
enunciated the law in the context of SICA to be that a cessation of 
legal proceedings would be justified only if the dues in respect of 
which adjudication is ongoing is also included in or within the 
contemplation of the Scheme presented to BIFR. Their Lordships 
had analysed and distinguished its previous decisions in Gram 
Panchayat v. Shree Vallabh Glass Works Limited, (1990) 2 SCC 
440 as well as Maharashtra Tubes Ltd. v. State of Industrial and 
Investment Corporation of Maharashtra Ltd., (1993) 2 SCC 144 
on the reasoning that in those cases the liability of the sick 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 55 of 91 
company had arisen for the first time after the sanction of the 
Scheme by BIFR….  
 
   
8. In Sirmor Sudburg Auto Ltd. v. Kuldip Singh Lamba, [1998] 91 
Comp. Cas. 727, R.C. Lahoti, J., as the Learned Single Judge of 
this Court then was, opined that to be entitled to a stay of legal 
proceedings under Section 22 of the Act, a mere pendency of the 
enquiry would not suffice; the claimed dues must be reckoned or 
included in the sanctioned scheme. A suit for eviction against a 
sick industrial company is not liable to be stayed under Section 
22(1) of the SICA. This decision has been followed by the Division 
Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Taulis Pharma Ltd. v. Bengal 
Immunity Ltd., [2002] 108 Comp. Cas. 237. Similar views have 
also been expressed in Vibgyar Ink Chem (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Safe Pack 
Polymers Ltd., [1998] 93 Com. Cas. 407, which likewise is a 
decision of the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court 
which enunciates that “an independent transaction de hors the 
scheme obviously cannot thus be covered within the ambit of 
Section 22 of the 1985 Act”. 
 
9. Justice Lahoti's view has also been followed by a Single Bench 
of the Calcutta High Court in Fort William Industries 
Limited v. Usha Bentron Limited, [2002] 108 Comp. Cas. 176. His 
Lordship, Dr. Mukundakam Sharma, J. has, in the Cement 
Corporation of India v. Manohar Basin, 82 (1999) DLT 343 : 
1999 (51) DRJ 535 observed that since no documentary proof had 
been furnished to disclose that any scheme stood sanctioned the 
so-called SICA bar was not attracted. A Single Bench of the 
Bombay High Court in Special Steels v. Jay Prestressed Products 
Ltd., [1991] 72 Comp. Cas. 277 has opined that the pivotal 
question in connection with the current conundrum concerns the 
assets of the Company and its functioning, and these would not be 
jeopardized if a civil suit continues. In Hardip Singh v. Income 
Tax Officer, Amritsar, [1979] 118 ITR 57 (SC) the winding-up 
petition was allowed to continue and only when the third and final 
stage of the dissolution of the Company came to be reached, was 
the moratorium of Section 22 of the SICA enforced.”

Page 56 of 91 
90.  The original plaintiff has placed strong reliance upon the decision of a single 
judge of the Delhi High Court in Sunil Mittal (supra). It was held therein that 
since the liability was neither admitted nor taken into consideration by any 
rehabilitation scheme, the suit proceedings could not have been adjourned sine 
die under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. The relevant paragraphs are extracted 
hereinbelow:  
 “21. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, 
I feel as the FChas not admitted its liability to pay the amount to 
the tune as claimed by the plaintiff nor such an amount has been 
reckoned or taken into consideration by any scheme of 
rehabilitation of the sick defendant company, therefore, the 
proceedings of the present suit cannot be adjourned sine die. As a 
matter of fact the defendant has not placed on record any 
documentary evidence to show that any such scheme has been 
formulated as yet and if formulated whether the said amount has 
been taken care of allegedly being owed to the Plaintiff. 
22. For the aforesaid reasons, I feel that the application of the 
Defendant totally misconceived and accordingly, the same is 
dismissed.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
91.  It has come to our notice that the said decision in Sunil Mittal (supra) was 
challenged in appeal before a division bench of the Delhi High Court in LML 
Ltd. v. Sunil Mittal reported in 2013 SCC OnLine Del 1766 wherein the bench 
set aside the decision and held that Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act would apply 
to the facts of the case. The bench observed that from the record it was clear 
that the amount as claimed by the plaintiff in the recovery suit was admittedly 
covered by the scheme and thus the proceeding was liable to be suspended by 
application of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. Thus, the position of law held in 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 57 of 91 
Sunil Mittal (supra), could not be said to have been disturbed, but only its 
incorrect application to the facts of the specific case was set aside in LML Ltd. 
(supra).  
 
92.  The decision in LML Ltd. (supra), on the contrary, fortifies the interpretation 
of Section 22(1) as was done in Sunil Mittal (supra) and Saketh India (supra). 
The relevant paragraph of the decision in LML Ltd. (supra) is extracted 
hereinbelow:  
“16. The principle of law is thus unambiguous. Where the amount 
claimed or the liability sought to be set up is covered under the 
scheme, Section 22(1) will be attracted and there would be an 
automatic suspension of all legal proceedings including a suit for 
recovery of money. In the present case, the amount Rs. 
21,74,490.88 is admittedly a part of the DRS pending before the 
BIFR. The debt of Rs. 3,00,000/- on account of sales tax dues, the 
petitioner admits as his liability. Even if this amount is not 
permitted to be adjusted at this stage as has been pointed out by 
the learned counsel for the respondent, keeping in view the wide 
import of the language of Section 22 of the said Act there can be 
no question of continuing with the suit proceedings. It also cannot 
be lost sight of the fact that the parties were maintaining a running 
account; payments were being made from time to time; it would 
thus not be possible to segregate the element of debt since the 
question would be whether the debt due to the plaintiff is correctly 
reflected or a lesser amount is in fact due to him. The language of 
Section 22 would take into its sweep a situation even where if the 
full amount is not a part of the DRS. The question of continuation 
of the suit would not arise.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
93.  In M/s Haryana Steel & Alloys Ltd. v. M/s Transport Corporation of India 
reported in (2012) SCC OnLine Del 2140 it was held that the mere contention 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 58 of 91 
of the sick company unsubstantiated by any material indicating that the 
amount forming subject-matter of the recovery suit is covered under the 
scheme, would not be sufficient to bring the company under the protective 
ambit of Section 22(1) of the Act. The relevant paragraphs of the said decision 
are extracted thus:  
“11. However, there is another dimension to the said embargo 
placed on filing of the suit for recovery against a company when 
the proceedings are pending under the SICA, which is the 
necessity of the inclusion of the dues payable by the company to 
the plaintiff in the scheme formulated before the BIFR. It is a 
settled legal position that it is not by mere pendency of an enquiry 
under Section 16 of the said Act or preparation of the scheme 
thereof being under consideration or even filing of an appeal 
under section 25 before the appellate authority that by itself would 
entitle the appellant for the said statutory injunction against the 
respondent/plaintiff as the benefit of the prohibition or embargo 
created under section 22 of the Act would come into operation only 
where the appellant/defendant has disclosed before the Court, that 
the amounts claimed by the respondent/plaintiff have been duly 
shown and disclosed in the scheme formulated and laid before the 
BIFR. The Apex Court in the case of Deputy Commercial Tax 
Officer v. Corromandal 
Pharmaceuticals, (1997) 
10 
SCC 
649 enunciated the law to hold that a cessation of legal 
proceedings would be justified only if the dues in respect of which 
adjudication is ongoing is also included in the contemplation of 
scheme presented by BIFR…  
 
xxx 
 
xxx   
xxx  
14. In the light of the above settled legal position, analyzing the 
facts of the case at hand, it is manifest that no material was placed 
on record by the appellant to show that the amount in respect of 
which the respondent laid its claim in the said recovery suit was 
reflected in the scheme laid before the BIFR. The only contention 
raised by the appellant before the trial court as well as before this 
Court was that the prohibition or embargo as envisaged in Section 
22 would come into operation immediately once the defendant 
brings to the notice of the Court that an inquiry under Section 16 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 59 of 91 
is pending before the Board or an appeal is pending relating to the 
said inquiry before the Appellate Authority. Having failed to place 
any such material on record, this Court is of the clear view that 
the bar or embargo envisaged under Section 22 of the Act will not 
apply to the facts of the present case as the appellant cannot take 
the advantage of the said provision merely because an inquiry 
under Section 16 was pending before the BIFR or an Appeal under 
Section 25 against the order of BIFR was pending before the 
AAIFR.”

94.  In Kusum Products Ltd. v. Hitkari Industries Ltd. reported in 2014 SCC 
OnLine Del 4926, a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court, relying 
upon the decision in Raheja Universal (supra) held that a suit for recovery of 
money simpliciter will not be liable to be suspended under Section 22(1) of 
the 1985 Act. It was observed thus:  
“3. The aforesaid paragraphs show that the proceedings for which 
prior permission is required under Section 22 of SICA are 
proceedings in the nature of execution, distress or like. It is not 
every suit or every suit for recovery which automatically becomes 
proceedings in the nature of execution, distress or like, and only 
such suits of recovery where there would be proceedings which 
cause liquidation of assets of a sick company, would be those suits 
which would be hit by the bar of Section 22 of SICA. 
 
4. In the present case, the suit for recovery of money is a suit for 
recovery of money simplicitor. Counsel for the plaintiff does not 
press the interim applications under Order 38 Rule 5 of Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) and Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 CPC. 
Accordingly, in the subject suit, there is no threat to the liquidation 
of the assets of the sick company and therefore no prior permission 
is required under Section 22 of SICA.”

95.  In FMI Investment Pvt. Ltd. v. Montari Industries Ltd. and Another 
reported in (2012) SCC OnLine Del 5354, the High Court undertook a 
comprehensive analysis of the dictum as laid in Raheja Universal (supra) and 
Saketh India (supra) and held thus:  
“6. The salient conclusions which can be arrived at from reading 
of the aforesaid paras in the case of Raheja Universal (supra) are 
: - 
(i) The proceedings which are affected by Section 22(1) are 
proceedings in the nature of execution, distress or the like. 
(ii) It depends on facts of each case as to whether the suit is hit by 
Section 22 i.e. all suits including of recovery, are not hit by Section 
22(1). 
(iii) Only those suits which have the effect of execution, distress or 
like action against the properties of the sick company are hit by 
Section 22 i.e. where a suit is simply for recovery of moneys, and 
the properties of a sick company are not threatened by the 
proceedings including interim proceedings such as appointment of 
receiver, execution, distress or the like, such suits can continue 
without permission under Section 22. 
 
7. Learned counsel for the defendant no. 2 sought to place reliance 
on the following three judgments to argue that permission under 
Section 22 is a sine qua non. 
(i) Managing Director, Bhoruka Textiles Ltd. v. Kashmiri Rice 
Industries (2009) 7 SCC 521; 
(ii) Tata Davy Ltd. v. State of Orissa (1997) 6 SCC 669; 
(iii) Dr. B.K. Modi v. Morgan Securities and Credits Pvt. 
Ltd. and Morgan Securities and Credits Pvt. Ltd. v. Dr. B.K. 
Modi MANU/DE/2779/2012 
 
8. In my opinion, all the three judgments, which have been cited 
on behalf of defendant no. 2 have no application because the legal 
position is sufficiently elaborated by the Supreme Court in the 
judgment of Raheja Universal (supra). 
 
9. None of the aforesaid judgments cited on behalf of defendant 
no. 2 deal with the issue of interpretation of Section 22 of SICA as 
has been done by the Division Bench of three Judges in the case 
of Raheja Universal (supra) and which holds that unless the suit 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 61 of 91 
proceedings are in the nature of ‘execution, distress or the like’, 
the suit can continue. The judgments relied upon by the defendant 
no. 2 are judgments which simply hold that once a company is a 
sick company, permission is required under Section 22 of the 
SICA, however, none of the judgments cited on behalf of the 
defendant no. 2 deal with the proposition as incorporated in the 
later judgment of the Division Bench of three Judges of the 
Supreme Court in the case of Raheja Universal (supra). 
Accordingly, it is held that the suit is maintainable. 
 
10. In the present suit for recovery it cannot be said that the suit is 
of a nature which has impact of or threat to the properties of the 
defendant No. 1 sick company to affect the scheme of revival. The 
suit is a simple suit for recovery under Order 37 CPC not having 
proceedings, whether interim or final, of execution, distress or the 
like and hence the suit is not hit by Section 22 of SICA. So far as 
defendant No. 2/guarantor is concerned, the suit against him will 
not surely hit any assets of the sick company and hence is not 
barred under Section 22 of SICA.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
96.  In one recent decision of the Delhi High Court in Chhattisgarh Distilleries 
Ltd. v. Percept Advertising Limited reported in 2023 SCC OnLine Del 6417, 
while considering the question on applicability of Section 22(1) of the 1985 
Act, it was held thus:  
“8. It is well settled that there was legal duty cast upon the 
appellant/defendant to bring it to the notice of the Court that it had 
qualified for the protection under the SICA, and this obligation 
was not discharged. There is no gainsaying that the aforesaid 
provision has been interpreted in umpteen number of cases 
decided by the Apex Court as well as this Court. In the cited case 
of Saketh India Limited (supra), it was observed that the phrase 
“recovery of money” must be construed ejusdem generis and 
accordingly recovery proceedings in the nature of execution or 
any other coercive enforcement that has been ordained to be not 
maintainable. There is nothing in the said provision so as to hold 
the legal proceedings to be not maintainable, or liable to be 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 62 of 91 
halted, even if the debt sought to be proved in the plaint has not 
been admitted. Furthermore, it was observed that there can be no 
logic in denying legal recourse to a party for proving its debt. The 
said decision was relied upon by this Court again in the decision 
of Ralson Industries Ltd. (now known as Da Rubber Industries 
Ltd) (supra), wherein it was categorically held that the 
proceedings that can be halted by invoking Section 22 of the SICA 
should be in the nature of execution, distress or the like.”  
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
97.  From the aforesaid discussion, the position of law on the first issue before us 
appears to be that for the applicability of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act, three 
aspects need to be considered –  
I. 
First, an inquiry under Section 16 of the 1985 Act must be pending; or 
any scheme referred to in Section 17 of the 1985 Act must be under 
preparation or consideration or a sanctioned scheme must be under 
implementation; or an appeal under Section 25 of the 1985 Act must be 
pending – in relation to the company against whom the legal 
proceedings sought to be suspended have been initiated.  
II. 
Secondly, the proceedings must be one from amongst the six types as 
described in paragraph 65 of this judgment, or of a similar nature, i.e. 
ejusdem generis to the said six types of proceedings.   
III. 
Thirdly, the proceedings must have the effect of threatening the assets 
of the sick company and interfering with the formulation, consideration, 
finalisation or implementation of the scheme.  
 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 63 of 91 
98.  Applying the aforesaid tests to the facts of the present case, we have already 
observed that requirement (i) is fulfilled. The proceeding in question being a 
suit for recovery of money, requirement (ii) is also satisfied. However, we are 
of the considered opinion that the third requirement is not fulfilled. We say so 
because the suit for recovery was not of a nature which could have proved to 
be a threat to the properties of the defendant sick company or would have 
adversely impacted the scheme of revival. The suit was a simple suit for 
recovery of money towards the dues arising under the alleged illegal 
deductions under the contract. This cannot be said to be a proceeding in the 
nature of execution, distress or the like and hence the suit was not hit by 
Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.  
 
99.  By no stretch of imagination could it be said that the legislature intended to 
include even the proceedings for the adjudication of the liabilities not admitted 
by a sick company within the protective ambit of Section 22(1) of the 1985 
Act. Such an adjudicatory process only determines the liability of the 
defendant towards the plaintiff, and does not threaten the assets of the sick 
company or interfere with the formulation of the scheme unless execution 
proceedings are initiated pursuant to the completion of such adjudicatory 
process. In the case of Jay Engineering (supra), it was rightly observed by 
this Court in the context of arbitration proceedings under the 1993 Act for the 
adjudication of claims, that while the execution of an award would definitely 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 64 of 91 
be suspended under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act, the adjudicatory process 
for arriving at such an award cannot be said to be suspended by the said 
provision. This position also seems to be justified in light of the fact that the 
proceedings before the BIFR under the 1985 Act were generally long-drawn 
and time consuming and it would subserve the interest of justice if a party was 
prevented even from proving the debt/liability of the sick company for the 
entirety of that lengthy period.  
 
100. We may also look at Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act by applying the mischief 
rule of interpretation. G.P. Singh in his authoritative commentary on the 
interpretation of statutes describes the mischief rule of construction as follows: 
“The rule which is also known as 'purposive construction' or 
'mischief rule', enables consideration of four matters in construing 
an Act: (i) What was the law before the making of the Act, (ii) What 
was the mischief or defect for which the law did not provide, (iii) 
What is the remedy that the Act has provided, and (iv) What is the 
reason of the remedy. The rule then directs that the courts must 
adopt that construction which "shall suppress the mischief and 
advance the remedy.”” 
 
 
101. Applying the aforesaid rule to Section 22(1) of the Act, we find that there 
was a vacuum in the legal framework to deal with sick industrial companies 
and provide ameliorative steps for their revival. The 1985 Act was thus 
enacted to fill in this vacuum. The mischief which was sought to be dealt with 
by the enactment of Section 22 was any such legal proceeding which could 
impact the assets of the sick company and in-turn negatively impact the 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 65 of 91 
formulation and implementation of the rehabilitative scheme. This provision 
was inserted to provide a remedy by ensuring that the multiple recourses 
available under the law for recovery of debts, etc. were suspended for the 
period during which the sick company was under the ameliorative shelter of 
the BIFR. Finally, it can be said that the reason for the remedy was to shield 
the formulation and implementation of the revival scheme from any 
impediments thereby maximising the chances of revival of sick company, 
which was the ultimate object sought to be achieved by the Act.  
 
102. The original defendants have placed strong reliance on 3 decisions of this 
Court in Jay Engineering (supra), Bhoruka Textiles (supra) and Tata Motors 
(supra) respectively. We have discussed in the foregoing parts of this 
judgment as to how this Court in Jay Engineering (supra) expressly observed 
that it was not the adjudicatory process, but the execution of an award which 
would be restricted by Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. This judgment, thus, 
only furthers the line of reasoning we have adopted to negate the contention 
of the original defendants on the applicability of Section 22(1) of the 1985 
Act.  
 
103. The decision in Bhoruka Textiles (supra) dealt with the specific facts in 
that case and should be read alongwith the decision in Raheja Universal 
(supra) wherein the scope of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act was considered in 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 66 of 91 
detail by a three-Judge bench. We would also like to observe that the reliance 
placed by this Court in Bhoruka Textiles (supra) on the decision in Tata 
Motors (supra) seems to be misplaced. The relevant paragraph of Bhoruka 
Textiles (supra) is reproduced hereinbelow:  
“10. Section 22 of the Act must be interpreted giving a plain 
meaning to its contents. An enquiry in terms of Section 16 of the 
Act by the Board is permissible upon receipt of a reference. Thus, 
reference having been made on 27-12-2001 and the suit having 
been filed on 17-12-2002, the receipt of a reference must be held 
to be the starting period for proceeding with the enquiry. 
 
11. The effect of the provisions of the Act has been considered by 
a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Tata Motors Ltd. v. 
Pharmaceutical Products of India Ltd. [(2008) 7 SCC 619] 
wherein it, in no uncertain terms, held that SICA is a special 
statute and, thus, overrides other Acts like the Companies Act, 
1956, stating: (SCC p. 635, paras 31-33) 
 
“31. SICA furthermore was enacted to secure the principles 
specified in Article 39 of the Constitution of India. It seeks to 
give effect to the larger public interest. It should be given 
primacy because of its higher public purpose. Section 26 of 
SICA bars the jurisdiction of the civil courts. 
 
32. What scheme should be prepared by the operating agency 
for revival and rehabilitation of the sick industrial company is 
within the domain of BIFR. Section 26 not only covers orders 
passed under SICA but also any matter which BIFR is 
empowered to determine. 
 
33. The jurisdiction of the civil court is, thus, barred in respect 
of any matter for which the Appellate Authority or the Board is 
empowered. The High Court may not be a civil court but its 
jurisdiction in a case of this nature is limited.” 
 
12. If the civil court's jurisdiction was ousted in terms of the 
provisions of Section 22 of the Act, any judgment rendered by it 
would be coram non judice. It is a well-settled principle of law that 
a judgment and decree passed by a court or tribunal lacking 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 67 of 91 
inherent jurisdiction would be a nullity. In Kiran Singh v. Chaman 
Paswan [AIR 1954 SC 340] this Court held: (AIR p. 342, para 6) 
 
“6. … It is a fundamental principle well established that a 
decree passed by a court without jurisdiction is a nullity, and 
that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is 
sought to be enforced or relied upon, even at the stage of 
execution and even in collateral proceedings. A defect of 
jurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether it 
is in respect of the subject-matter of the action, strikes at the 
very authority of the court to pass any decree, and such a defect 
cannot be cured even by consent of parties.” 
(See also Chief Engineer, Hydel Project v. Ravinder Nath 
[(2008) 2 SCC 350 : (2008) 1 SCC (L&S) 940] , SCC 
p. 361, para 26.)” 
 
 
104. A perusal of the above indicates that in Tata Motors (supra), it was Section 
26 and not Section 22 of the 1985 Act which was under consideration. As 
opposed to Section 26 of the Act, which bars the jurisdiction of the civil courts 
in respect of those matters for which the BIFR or the AAIFR are empowered, 
Section 22 only places a temporary embargo on the initiation or continuation 
of legal proceedings in respect of certain matters mentioned therein. Further, 
unlike Section 22, where the said suspension can be revoked by seeking 
express permission of the BIFR or the AAIFR, no such permission can be 
sought under Section 26 of the 1985 Act. Again, in any view of the matter, the 
adjudication and determination of a contested liability under a contract is 
undoubtedly the domain of the civil court or an arbitral tribunal and not that 
of the BIFR or the AAIFR.  
 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024

v. 
ISSUE NO. 2: Whether the High Court was correct in granting 24% 
Compound Interest on the Principal Decretal Amount in favour of the 
original Plaintiff? 
 
105.  The High Court in its impugned judgment considered, as a separate issue, 
whether the original plaintiff was entitled to claim 24% compound interest 
from the original defendants on the delayed payments.  
a.  
Concept of Interest 
106. When interest is awarded by the Court, our normal feeling is that it is so 
awarded by way of penalty or punishment. But interest in all cases is not 
granted by way of penalty or punishment. In this regard, reference may be 
made to the decision of this Court in the case of Alok Shanker Pandey v. 
Union of India, reported in 2007 AIR (SC) 1198, wherein the concept of grant 
of interest has been explained in the following manner: 
"It may be mentioned that there is misconception about interest. 
Interest is not a penalty or punishment at all, but it is the normal 
accretion on capital. For example, if A had to pay B a certain 
amount, say ten years ago, but he offers that amount to him today, 
then he has pocketed the interest on the principal amount. Had A 
paid that amount to B ten years ago, B would have invested that 
amount somewhere and earned interest thereon, but instead of that 
A has kept that amount with himself and earned interest on it for 
this period. Hence equity demands that A should not only pay back 
the principal but also interest thereon to B." 
 
107. The above-noted decision of this Court makes it clear that interest on the 
delayed payment of the claim amount accrues due to the continuing wrong 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 69 of 91 
committed by the wilful withholding of the payment towards the claim, 
resulting in a continuous injury until such payment is made, or in other words, 
until the claim is realised.  
 
108. The High Court relied upon the provisions of the 1993 Act to hold that as 
per Sections 4 and 5 respectively of the said legislation, the original plaintiff, 
which was a small-scale industrial undertaking, was entitled to claim 
compound interest @ 24% per annum from the original defendants. As a 
result, the High Court set aside the decree of the trial court which granted 12% 
simple interest in favour the original plaintiff.  
 
109. The original defendants are aggrieved by the awarding of 24% interest in 
favour of the original plaintiff, which they contend has resulted in the principal 
decretal amount getting inflated exorbitantly. The original plaintiff, on the 
other hand, has argued that the impugned judgment of the High Court insofar 
as it deals with the issue of interest cannot be said to suffer from any infirmity 
and was arrived at after due consideration of relevant material viz. the 
Handbook of Statistics of Indian Economy published by the Reserve Bank of 
India, etc. and after hearing the parties at length. 
 
110. The original plaintiff has further submitted that the High Court considered 
the floor rate charged by the SBI for the financial year 1993-1994, which was 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 70 of 91 
19%, as observed under the Table 74 on Structure of Interest Rates in the 
Handbook of Statistics of Indian Economy published by the Reserve Bank of 
India.  
 
111. We shall briefly consider the object and scope of the 1993 Act for a better 
understanding of the issue before us. The Interest on Delayed Payments to 
Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, 1992 was 
promulgated by the President of India on 23.09.1992. To replace this 
ordinance, the 1993 Act was enacted on 02.04.1993 and came into force with 
retrospective effect from 23.09.1992. Subsequently, the 1993 Act was repealed 
by the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 
(“MSMED Act, 2006”). The statement of objects and reasons to the 1993 Act 
reads as under:  
“A policy statement on small scale industries was made by the 
Government in Parliament. It was stated at that time that suitable 
legislation would be brought to ensure prompt payment of money 
by buyers to the small industrial units. 
 
2. Inadequate working capital in a small scale or an ancillary 
industrial undertaking causes serious and endemic problems 
affecting the health of such undertaking. Industries in this sector 
have also been demanding that adequate measures be taken in this 
regard. The Small Scale Industries Board, which is an apex 
advisory body on policies relating to small scale industrial units 
with representatives from all the States, governmental bodies and 
the industrial sector, also expressed this view. It was, therefore, 
felt that prompt payments of money by buyers should be statutorily 
ensured and mandatory provisions for payment of interest on the 
outstanding money, in case of default, should be made. The buyers, 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 71 of 91 
if required under law to pay interest, would refrain from 
withholding payments to small scale and ancillary industrial 
undertakings. 
 
3. An Ordinance, namely, the Interest on Delayed Payments to 
Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, 
1992, was, therefore, promulgated by the President on the 23rd 
September, 1992. 
 
4. The Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance and to achieve the 
aforesaid objects.” 
 
 
112. It is evident from the aforesaid statement of objects and reasons that the 
legislature desired to bring about a legislation which would ensure prompt 
payment of money to small scale units, as the absence of working capital may 
have severe impacts on the functioning of small scale and ancillary industries.  
The 1993 Act envisaged that there should be minimal delay in payments to 
small scale units. Section 2 of the 1993 Act provides for the certain important 
definitions which are reproduced hereinbelow: 
“(b) “appointed day” means the day following immediately after 
the expiry of the period of thirty days from the date of acceptance 
or the day of deemed acceptance of any goods or any services by 
a buyer from a supplier; 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this clause,— 
(i) “the day of acceptance” means,— 
(a) the day of the actual delivery of goods or the rendering of 
services; or 
(b) where any objection is made in writing by the buyer 
regarding acceptance of goods or services within thirty days 
from the day of the delivery of goods or the rendering of 
services, the day on which such objection is removed by the 
supplier; 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 72 of 91 
(ii) “the day of deemed acceptance” means, where no objection is 
made in writing by the buyer regarding acceptance of goods or 
services within thirty days from the day of the delivery of goods or 
the rendering of services, the day of the actual delivery of goods 
or the rendering of services; 
(c) “buyer” means whoever buys any goods or receives any 
services from a supplier for consideration; 
xxx 
 
xxx   
xxx 
(f) “supplier” means an ancillary industrial undertaking or a 
small scale industrial undertaking holding a permanent 
registration certificate issued by the Directorate of Industries of a 
State or Union territory and includes,— 
(i) the National Small Industries Corporation, being a company, 
registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956); 
(ii) the Small Industries Development Corporation of a State or a 
Union territory, by whatever name called, being a company 
registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956).]” 
 
113. Section 3 of the 1993 Act provides for the liability of the buyer to make 
payment to the small-scale industries whereas Section 4 and 5 respectively of 
the said Act pertain to the date from which and the rate at which interest is 
payable. Section 5 of the 1993 Act also stipulates that the buyer shall be liable 
to pay compound interest. Sections 3, 4 and 5 respectively of the 1993 Act, as 
existing at the time when the dispute between the parties arose, are reproduced 
thus: - 
“3. Liability of buyer to make payment - Where any supplier 
supplies any goods or renders any services to any buyer, the buyer 
shall make payment therefor on or before the date agreed upon 
between him and the supplier in writing or, where there is no 
agreement in this behalf, before the appointed day. 
 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 73 of 91 
4. Date from which and rate at which interest is payable - Where 
any buyer fails to make payment of the amount to the supplier, as 
required under section 3, the buyer shall, notwithstanding 
anything contained in any agreement between the buyer and the 
supplier or in any law for the time being in force, be liable to pay 
interest to the supplier on that amount from the appointed day or, 
as the case may be, from the date immediately following the date 
agreed upon, at such rate, which is five per cent points above the 
floor rate for comparable lending. 
Explanation: For the purposes of this section, "floor rate for 
comparable lending" means the highest of the minimum lending 
rates charged by scheduled banks (not being co-operative banks) 
on credit limits in accordance with the directions given or issued 
to banking companies generally by the Reserve Bank of India 
under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949). 
 
5. Liability of buyer to pay compound interest - Notwithstanding 
anything contained in any agreement between a supplier and a 
buyer or in any law for the time being in force, the buyer shall be 
liable to pay compound interest (with monthly interest) at the rate 
mentioned in section 4 on the amount due to the supplier.”  
 
114. On a perusal of Section 3 of the 1993 Act, we find that where any supplier 
supplies any goods, the buyer shall make payment on or before the date agreed 
upon between him and the supplier in writing or, where there is no agreement 
in this behalf, before the appointed day. In the instant case, as per the terms of 
the NIT, payment was to be made within 20 days from the receipt of the goods.  
 
115. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment, the High Court 
has awarded 24% compound interest on the amounts due to the original 
plaintiff from the date the amounts were determined to have become due till 
the date of their realisation by the original plaintiff. While there is no doubt 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 74 of 91 
that the rate of interest applicable to the dues of the original plaintiff as 
determined by the High Court is correct, we think it is necessary to examine 
if the compound interest can be said to have continued to accrue even when 
FCIL was declared a sick company and was awaiting its revival before the 
BIFR. In other words, it is not the rate of interest but the period for which it is 
applicable, is the question that is to be determined.  
 
116.  We have discussed at length in the foregoing paragraphs of the judgment 
the object behind the enactment of the 1985 Act. Sickness of industrial 
companies was considered to be a problem that affected the country at large, 
and thus the 1985 Act was enacted as per the policy directions contained in 
Article 39 of the Constitution to provide, inter alia, ameliorative steps for the 
revival of sick companies, and for the expeditious detection of potentially sick 
companies. In particular, we would like to mention that Section 19 of the 1985 
Act provides that the scheme for rehabilitation of a sick company may provide 
for financial assistance to the sick company by way of loans, advances, reliefs 
or concessions or sacrifices from the Central Government, a State 
Government, a public financial institution etc.  
 
117. In the present case, in pursuance of Section 19 of the Act, a number of 
decisions were taken by the CCEA on 09.05.2013 including the waiver of 
loans and interest thereon by the Central Government which ran into 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 75 of 91 
thousands of crores. As per the document F.No. 18055/13/2012-FCA-1 titled 
“Gist of the CCEA decisions dated 09th May, 2013” published by the Ministry 
of Chemicals and Fertilizers, it appears that the dues of the major unsecured 
creditors were settled at 30% of their dues as on 31.03.2003. Further, the dues 
of some other parties were settled without any interest or penalty, as otherwise 
the entire process of revival might have gotten derailed.  
 
118. We have also discussed how Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act suspends any 
legal proceedings of the nature specified therein if they can potentially 
interfere with the consideration, sanction or execution of the rehabilitation 
scheme. The intention behind the sanction and execution of a rehabilitation 
scheme, without a doubt, is to increase the chances of the revival of the sick 
company in public interest. 
 
119. Thus, on one hand we have the beneficial provisions of the 1985 Act, 
enacted to maximise the chances of revival of sick industrial companies, while 
on the other, we have the 1993 Act, which was enacted with the intention to 
ensure that small-scale industries are paid their dues in time. This object of the 
1993 Act was sought to be achieved by providing a high interest rate, with 
monthly compounding, so as to act as a deterrent for the buyers.  
 
120. A preliminary contention was raised by the original defendants that the 
original plaintiff chose to institute a civil suit for recovery of money, rather 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 76 of 91 
than following the process prescribed under Section 6 of the 1993 Act, which 
provides for the referring of a dispute arising under the 1993 Act to arbitration 
before the Industry Facilitation Council, and thus for this reason, the suit for 
recovery, which is expressly suspended under Section 22(1) of the Act, should 
be held as not maintainable. It was also argued that even otherwise no interest 
should be granted on the amount claimed as due since the mechanism 
prescribed under Section 6(2) of the 1993 Act was not followed.  
 
121. Section 6 of the 1993 Act reads as follows:  
“6. Recovery of amount due -  
(1) The amount due from a buyer, together with the amount of 
interest calculated in accordance with the provisions of sections 4 
and 5, shall be recoverable by the supplier from the buyer by way 
of a suit or other proceeding under any law for the time being in 
force. 
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), any 
party to a dispute may make a reference to the Industry 
Facilitation Council for acting as an arbitrator or conciliator in 
respect of the matters referred to in that sub-section and the 
provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 
1996) shall apply to such dispute as if the arbitration or 
conciliation were pursuant to an arbitration agreement referred to 
in sub-section (1) of section 7 of that Act.” 
 
122. We do not find any force in this contention of the original defendants. 
Section 6 merely provides that for the purpose of recovery of the amounts due 
under the 1993 Act, a supplier may make a reference to the Industries 
Facilitation Council, which is established under Section 7A of the 1993 Act. 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 77 of 91 
First, at the time of the institution of the suit by the original plaintiff, the 
Industries Facilitation Councils didn’t exist as the provision for their 
establishment was only brought in vide an amendment in 1998. Secondly, even 
otherwise, Section 6(2) of the 1993 Act merely provides for an alternate 
avenue to the supplier in addition to a suit or any other legal proceedings as 
mentioned in Section 6(1) of the 1993 Act.  
 
123. It is also pertinent to mention that in the absence of the express permission 
of the BIFR, Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act suspends any legal proceedings in 
the nature of execution during the pendency of the scheme before the BIFR, 
as execution would necessarily result in negatively impacting the assets of a 
sick company, thereby affecting the preparation, sanction or implementation 
of scheme and as a net effect, would bring down the chances of revival of the 
sick company.  
 
124. In the present case, the suit was decreed in favour of the original plaintiff 
by the trial court vide its judgment dated 19.09.2001. However, while the 
adjudication of the suit of the original plaintiff could not have been said to be 
barred under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act as it was for the mere 
determination of liability of the parties inter-se, the execution of decree 
obtained as a result thereof was expressly suspended during the period as 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 78 of 91 
mentioned in the said provision, unless the requisite permission from the BIFR 
or the AAIFR could be obtained.  
 
125. Interest of justice requires that both the 1985 Act and the 1993 Act, which 
are in the nature of beneficial enactments, should be read harmoniously so as 
to impart a meaningful construction to the language of each of the enactments. 
It was held in Jay Engineering (supra) on the interplay between the two Acts 
as follows:  
“13. The 1993 Act was enacted to provide for and regulate the 
payment of interest on delayed payments to small-scale and 
ancillary industrial undertakings and for matters connected 
therewith. 
14. The provisions of the 1993 Act, therefore, do not envisage a 
situation where an industrial company becomes sick and requires 
framing of a scheme for its revival.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
126. In our opinion, it would defy logic to hold that even for the period when 
the principal decretal amount awarded by the civil court under a decree could 
not have been realised in lieu of the suspension of execution proceedings, 
interest would continue to mount on the principal decretal amount. Thus, while 
there is a stay on proceedings in the nature of distress and execution, etc. 
against the properties of the sick company, to safeguard its assets, awarding 
interest for that very same period, though not expressly barred under any 
provision of the Act, could not have been the intention of the legislature.  

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 79 of 91 
 
127. Any other interpretation would only lead to an absurd result that as soon as 
a sick company is revived after the steps taken by the BIFR, and concessions, 
financial support, etc. provided by the government, it would be prone to the 
liability of having to pay exorbitant interest that would have accrued on any 
decree which can be put to execution after the end of BIFR proceedings. 
 
128. The net effect would be that a freshly revived sick company would 
potentially be saddled with huge amounts, as has happened in the present case 
because of the impugned judgment, and be at a risk of being rendered sick 
again, thus defeating the very purpose of the 1985 Act.  
 
129. A two-judge bench of this Court, in a recent decision in Modi Rubber Ltd. 
v. Continental Carbon India Ltd., reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 296 
decided the issue as to whether it was open to an unsecured creditor to not 
accept the scaled down value of its dues, as computed in the rehabilitation 
scheme, and wait for the revival of the sick company to recover its debt with 
interest post the rehabilitation. This Court, after an exhaustive consideration 
of the object of the 1985 Act, answered the issue in the negative and held as 
follows:  
“40. The short question, which is posed for the consideration of 
this Court is:— 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 80 of 91 
 
“Whether on approval of a scheme by the BIFR under the Sick 
Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, an 
unsecured creditor has the option not to accept the scaled down 
value of its dues, and to wait till the scheme for rehabilitation 
of the respondent - sick company has worked itself out, with an 
option to recover the debt with interest post such 
rehabilitation?” 
 
xxx 
 
xxx   
xxx 
 49. Thus, the primary concern of the Board would be the revival 
of the sick company and to save the sick company from winding 
up. That is why with a view to see that there is no impediment in 
framing the rehabilitation scheme and to get out the sick company 
from sickness. Section 22 provides for suspension of legal 
proceedings, contracts etc. On a bare reading of Section 22 and 
Section 22A of SICA, it appears that these two provisions primarily 
ensure that the scheme prepared by BIFR does not get frustrated 
because of certain other legal proceedings and to prevent untimely 
and unwarranted disposal of the assets of the sick industrial 
company. These sections clearly state certain restrictions which 
will impact upon the implementation of the scheme as well as on 
the assets of the company. 
 
xxx 
 
xxx   
xxx 
53. Keeping in mind the statement of objects and reasons for 
enactment of SICA, 1985 and the powers exercised by the BIFR 
and the primary concern to revive the sick industry for which the 
rehabilitation scheme is to be framed under Section 18, the 
question posed is required to be considered. 
 
xxx 
 
xxx   
xxx 
56. The operating agency is defined under Section 3(i) and it 
means any public financial institution, State-level institution, 
scheduled bank or any other person as may be specified by general 
or special order as its agency by the Board. No other persons 
including the unsecured creditors comes into picture like 
preparing the scheme under Section 18. Section 18 of the SICA 
does not provide that at the time of preparing of the scheme under 
Section 18 or when it is sanctioned by the Board, the unsecured 
creditors are required to be heard. The only provision for the 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 81 of 91 
consent required is Section 19 and the agency/person, who is 
required to give the financial assistance, its consent is required. 
Once the rehabilitation scheme/scheme under Section 18 prepared 
by the operating agency is sanctioned by the BIFR, which may 
include the scaling down the value of dues of the unsecured 
creditors, the same shall bind all, otherwise the rehabilitation 
scheme shall not be workable at all and the object and purpose of 
enactment of the SICA, 1985 will be frustrated. If some 
persons/unsecured creditors and/or even the labourers are 
permitted to get out of the purview of the scheme and thereafter 
permitting such or some of the unsecured creditors to wait till the 
scheme for rehabilitation of the sick company has worked itself 
out, in that case, the scheme shall not be workable at all. To make 
the company viable, the concerned persons including the 
unsecured creditors have to sacrifice to some extent otherwise the 
revival efforts shall fail.

59. If the submission on behalf of the unsecured creditors, which 
has been accepted by the High Court in the case of Continental 
Carbon India Ltd. (supra) that an unsecured creditor can opt out 
of the scheme sanctioned by the BIFR under the SICA, 1985 and 
is allowed not to accept the scaled down value of its dues and may 
wait till the scheme for rehabilitation of the sick company has 
worked itself out, with an option to recover the debt post such 
rehabilitation is accepted/allowed, in that case, the minority 
creditors may frustrate the rehabilitation scheme, which may 
frustrate the object and purpose of enactment of SICA, 1985.

61. Thus, minority creditors and that too some unsecured creditors 
cannot be permitted to stall the rehabilitation of the sick company 
by not accepting the scaled down value of its dues. Unless and 
until there is a sacrifice by all concerned, including the creditors, 
financial institutions, unsecured creditors, labourers, there shall 
not be any revival of the sick industrial company/company. 
 
62. Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the unsecured 
creditors that the unsecured creditors should have an option not to 
accept the scaled down value of its dues and to wait till the scheme 
for rehabilitation of the sick company has worked itself out, with 
an option to recover the debt post such rehabilitation is concerned, 
the same has no substance and cannot be accepted. It is required 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 82 of 91 
to be noted that in a given case, because of the scaling down of the 
value of the dues of the creditors, the company survives. The 
company has survived in view of the rehabilitation scheme because 
of the sacrifice/scaling down the value of the dues of the creditors 
including the financial institutions. How such a benefit can be 
permitted to be given to the unsecured creditors, who does not 
accept the scaled down value of its dues. Such an unsecured 
creditor cannot be permitted to take the benefit of the revival 
scheme, which is at the cost of other creditors including the 
financial institutions and even the labourers. 
 
63. Now, so far as the view taken by the High Court that the 
unsecured creditor had an option not to accept the scaled down 
value of its dues and can wait till the scheme for rehabilitation of 
the company has worked itself out with an option to recover the 
debt with interest post such rehabilitation is accepted, in a given 
case, the sick company, which has been able to revive because of 
the scaling down the value of the dues, may again become sick, if 
the entire dues of the unsecured creditors are to be paid thereafter. 
It may again lead to becoming such a revived company again as a 
sick company. If such a thing is permitted, in that case, it will again 
frustrate the object and purpose of enactment of the SICA, 1985. 
 
64. Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the unsecured 
creditors that to compel the unsecured creditors to accept the 
scaled down value of its dues would tantamount to and would be 
violative of Article 300A of the Constitution of India is concerned, 
the same has also no substance. Scaling down the value of the dues 
is under the rehabilitation scheme prepared under Section 18 of 
the SICA, which has a binding effect on all the creditors. 
Therefore, the same cannot be said to be violative of 
Article 300A of the Constitution of India. The law permits framing 
of the scheme taking into consideration and to provide the 
measures contemplated under Section 18, therefore, the 
rehabilitation scheme which provides for scaling down the value 
of dues of the creditors/unsecured creditors and even that of the 
labourers cannot be said to be violative of Article 300A of 
the Constitution of India as submitted on behalf of the unsecured 
creditors. 
 
65. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the view 
taken by the High Court of Delhi in Continental Carbon India 
Ltd. (supra) that on approval of a scheme by the BIFR under 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 83 of 91 
the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, the 
unsecured creditors has an option not to accept the scaling down 
value of its dues and to wait till the rehabilitation scheme of the 
sick company has worked itself out with an option to recover the 
debt with interest post such rehabilitation is erroneous and 
contrary to the scheme of SICA, 1985 and the same deserves to be 
quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
130. It is clear from the aforesaid observations of this Court that the revival of 
a sick industry should be given utmost priority and any interpretation which 
may result in a newly revived company becoming sick again should be 
avoided at all costs. In the case on hand, the decree in favour of the original 
plaintiff was not a part of the scheme of rehabilitation approved by the BIFR. 
Had it been so, it is nothing but obvious that the scheme would have proposed 
to settle the dues of the original plaintiff at a scaled down value, since a similar 
approach was adopted in the scheme to settle the dues of all the other creditors. 
In that scenario, the original plaintiff would not have had any other option but 
to accept the scaled down value and settle its dues as per the dictum in Modi 
Rubber (supra).  
 
131. The decree awarded by the trial court was contested by both the parties 
before the High Court.  No material was placed before us to show whether any 
steps were taken by the original plaintiff to obtain the permission of the BIFR 
for the execution of the decree of the trial court, or for the inclusion of the said 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 84 of 91 
decree in the rehabilitation scheme. At the same time, the original defendants 
too failed to bring anything on record to show if any steps were taken by them 
for the inclusion of the dues of the original plaintiff in the rehabilitation 
scheme.  
 
132. Although the facts of the case on hand are different from the facts in Modi 
Rubber (supra), we are of the opinion that the general principles enunciated 
in that case are equally applicable in the present case. Thus, only for the reason 
that the dues of the original plaintiff were not a part of the scheme and thus 
could not be settled at a scaled-down value, it cannot be held that it will now 
be open for the original plaintiff to recover its dues along with compound 
interest for the entire period in a manner that will saddle the defendant 
company with enormous liability, thereby possibly rendering the entire 
process of its revival futile.  This, in our view, could never have been the object 
of the 1985 Act and the provisions of the 1993 Act thus have to be harmonised 
so as to give effect to the true object of the 1985 Act.  
 
133. We also had the occasion to look into the decision of a 2-Judge bench of 
this Court in LML Limited v. Union of India & Others reported in (2014) 13 
SCC 375 wherein this Court was considering the purport of Section 19 of the 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 85 of 91 
MSMED Act, 2006 which is in pari-materia to the Section 7 of the 1993 Act. 
The provisions read as under:  
MSMED Act, 2006 
The 1993 Act 
“19. Application for setting aside decree, award or 
order.  
No application for setting aside any decree, award or 
other order made either by the Council itself or by any 
institution or centre providing alternate dispute 
resolution services to which a reference is made by 
the Council, shall be entertained by anyf court unless 
the appellant (not being a supplier) has deposited with 
it seventy-five per cent. of the amount in terms of the 
decree, award or, as the case may be, the other order 
in the manner directed by such court: 
Provided that pending disposal of the application to 
set aside the decree, award or order, the court shall 
order that such percentage of the amount deposited 
shall be paid to the supplier, as it considers reasonable 
under the circumstances of the case, subject to such 
conditions as it deems necessary to impose.” 
 
“7. Appeal –  
No appeal against any decree, 
award or other order shall be 
entertained by any court or other 
authority unless the appellant 
(not being a supplier) has 
deposited with it seventy-five 
per cent. of the amount in terms 
of the decree, award or, as the 
case may be, other order in the 
manner directed by such court 
or, as the case may be, such 
authority.” 
 
 
134. In the aforesaid case, the petitioner therein, having become a sick company, 
filed a reference to the BIFR under Section 15(1) of the 1985 Act. Around the 
same time, one of the respondents filed a claim petition before the Industries 
Facilitation Council under Section 6 of the 1993 Act. The 1993 Act was 
replaced by the MSMED Act, 2006 during the pendency of the proceedings. 
While the reference of the company remained pending before the BIFR, the 
Industries Facilitation Council passed an award in the favour of the said 
respondent, which the petitioner sought to appeal under the Section 34 of the 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. However, both the District Court and 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 86 of 91 
the High Court dismissed the challenge petition for not complying with the 
Section 19 of the MSMED Act, 2006, which mandates that 75% of the 
decretal/award amount has to be deposited by the appellant before the appeal 
can be entertained by the appellate court.  
 
135.  However, this Court set aside the dismissal orders and held as follows:  
“9. Having regard to the above position, we are satisfied that this 
is not a case where we should go into the legal question noted by 
us in the beginning of our order. We are satisfied that interest of 
justice shall be subserved if it is directed that failure to deposit the 
amount as directed by the District Judge, Kanpur Nagar in its 
order dated 12-5-2011 would not result in dismissal of the 
arbitration petition filed by the petitioner under Section 34 of the 
1996 Act challenging the award dated 22-12-2008. The said 
arbitration petition may remain pending with the District Judge 
until the finalisation of scheme by BIFR under Section 18 of the 
1985 Act. We order accordingly. 
10. The special leave petition is disposed of as above. Respondent 
3 is granted liberty to apply to BIFR to hear it before finalisation 
of the scheme. We observe that if such an application is made, 
BIFR shall hear Respondent 3 before finalisation of the scheme or 
any other order that may be passed by BIFR terminating the 
proceedings under 1985 Act.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
136. We would also like to advert to the principle of harmonious construction to 
understand the interplay between the 1985 Act and the 1993 Act. Simply put, 
the doctrine of harmonious construction is based on the principle that the 
legislature would not lightly take away from one hand what it had given with 
the other. Thus, this doctrine provides, that as far as possible, two seemingly 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 87 of 91 
conflicting provisions within a statute, or the seemingly conflicting provisions 
of one statute vis a vis another, should be construed in a manner so as to iron 
out any conflict.  
 
137. Section 10 of the 1993 Act provides for an overriding effect to the 
provisions of the said Act to the extent of inconsistency with any other statute. 
Similarly, Section 32 of the 1985 Act provides overriding effect to the 
provisions of the said Act except for the enactments specified therein. Dealing 
with a case involving the apparent conflict between the two statutes containing 
overriding provisions, this Court in Sarwan Singh v. Shri Kasturi Lal 
reported in (1977) 1 SCC 750 held as follows:  
“When two or more laws operate in the same field and each 
contains a non obstante clause stating that its provisions will 
override those of any other law, stimulating and incisive problems 
of interpretation arise. Since statutory interpretation has no 
conventional protocol, cases of such conflict have to be decided in 
reference to the object and purpose of the laws under 
consideration.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
138. Similarly, in Jay Engineering (supra), it was observed by this Court thus:  
“31. The endeavour of the court would, however, always be to 
adopt a rule of harmonious construction.” 
 
139. We would also like to refer to a recent decision of the Madras High Court 
in Metafilms India Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner (CT) (Addl.), 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 88 of 91 
Amaindakarai Assessment Circle, Chennai and Others reported in (2022) 96 
GSTR 272. Although the said decision was rendered in the peculiar facts of 
the case therein, yet the reasoning behind the same appears to have been 
similar to the one that we have employed. The relevant parts of the judgment 
are extracted hereinbelow:  
“27. Hence, the question would be, in the facts and circumstances 
of the present case, what is the date, on which, the repayment is 
due. As we have mentioned earlier, the case on hand is very 
peculiar and appears to have not arisen in any of the earlier 
litigations and therefore, it requires to be dealt with in a different 
manner and obviously on such a reasoning, any observation or 
direction, which we may issue in this judgment, cannot be treated 
as a precedent. 
 
28. As mentioned above, the appellant was de-registered by the 
BIFR on February 5, 2013. The first demand notice was issued on 
March 20, 2013. However, the appellant paid the dues only on 
April 25, 2015. The question would be, in the facts and 
circumstances, what would be the date, on which, the repayment 
of the loan is due. 
 
29. The Department's contention is that it should be the date, on 
which, the default occurred. If that is to be reckoned as the date, 
then an order of cancellation of the agreement followed by 
recovery proceedings should have been taken by the Department, 
which admittedly has not been done. This is presumably for the 
reason that from 2003 to 2013, the appellant was before the Board 
and it was declared as a sick industrial company and in terms of 
section 22 of the SICA, the respondent-Department was prohibited 
from proceeding with any recovery against the appellant and this 
is a statutory prohibition, which binds the respondent-Department. 
 
30. From the representation given by the appellant to the 
Government dated August 5, 2014, we find that the Sales Tax 
Department did not appear before the Board on several dates 
when the case was heard. Be that as it may, the due date for 
repayment could have never occurred, in the facts and 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 89 of 91 
circumstances, between August 1, 2003 when the appellant was 
referred to the BIFR and May 31, 2006, the appellant was declared 
as a sick industrial company till its net worth turned positive and 
it was discharged from the Board on February 5, 2013. 
 
31. Thus, on facts, we hold that the date, on which, the repayment 
became due for the appellant's case shall be fixed on February 6, 
2013. Admittedly, the appellant cleared the entire sales tax on 
April 25, 2015. Hence, for the period from February 6, 2013 to 
April 25, 2015, the appellant is liable to pay interest." 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
140. For the period during which the defendant company was sick and before 
the BIFR, it cannot be said that the withholding of the payment of the dues of 
the original plaintiff was wilful and intentional. We say so because first, the 
liability of the original defendants was disputed and was finally adjudicated 
only by way of the impugned judgment, much after the BIFR proceedings had 
come to an end; and secondly, even if the liability of the original defendants 
was not disputed, or was even acknowledged before the BIFR, recovery of the 
same could not have been done without the permission of the BIFR in view of 
the suspension of recovery proceedings by Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.  
   
141. Thus, in view of our aforesaid discussion, we deem it fit to exclude the 
period commencing from the date when FCIL was declared to be a sick 
company under the 1985 Act going up to the date when it was discharged by 
the BIFR and declared to be no longer a sick industrial company from the 
purview of the applicability of the interest provision under the 1993 Act. Thus, 
while the applicability of the 1993 Act to the dues of the original plaintiff is 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 90 of 91 
not disputed, such interest shall not be calculated for the period between 
06.11.1992 and 27.06.2013.  
 
E.  
CONCLUSION  
142. The net effect of the aforesaid discussion and findings is as follows:  
I. 
The suit instituted by the original plaintiff before the trial court was not 
hit by the embargo envisaged under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. 
Thus, the decree awarded in favour of the original plaintiff by the trial 
court and modified by the High Court, cannot be said to be coram non-
judice.  
II. 
The High Court committed no error in awarding 24% interest to the 
original plaintiff on its dues as per the provisions of the 1993 Act. 
However, the period during which the defendant company was a sick 
company as per the 1985 Act should be excluded for the purposes of 
calculation of interest.  
 
143. As a result, the impugned judgment and order of the High Court is upheld 
subject to the modification of the period for which interest may be granted as 
discussed aforesaid. To clarify, the interest will be calculated at 24% p.a. with 
monthly compounding.  
 
144. The appeals are disposed of in the aforesaid terms. The final amount that 
may be determined in accordance with the final decree shall be paid to the 

Civil Appeal Nos. 5366-5367 of 2024 
 
Page 91 of 91 
original plaintiff within a period of 4 weeks from today, failing which interest 
at the rate of 36% p.a. with monthly compounding shall accrue. 
  
 
145. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.  
 
146. Parties to bear their own costs.
