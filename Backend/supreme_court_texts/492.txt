Chandigarh allowed the second appeal of the plaintiff-
respondent, set aside the judgment and decree of the 
First Appellate Court, and restored the judgment and 
decree of the Trial Court decreeing the suit for 
possession. 
4. The dispute relates to land admeasuring 2176.6 sq. 
yards 
located 
in 
Khewat 
No.702/1146/Khasra 
No.116/26/2/15 situated at Samana, Tehsil-Samana, 
District-Patiala (hereinafter referred to as the “land in 
suit”). According to the appellant, the land in suit 
belonged to one Shri Inder Singh, predecessor in 
interest of the respondents. Shri Inder Singh had 
donated the land in suit to the appellants for the 
construction of a Veterinary Hospital in 1958 and had 
also handed over the possession of the same. The 
appellant-State constructed a veterinary hospital over 
the land in suit in 1958-1959. The Veterinary Hospital 
has been existing and is functional over the land in 
suit ever since. During his lifetime, Shri Inder Singh 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 3 of 27 
 
never objected or filed any suit alleging trespass or 
unauthorized occupation by the State. However, after 
the death of Shri Inder Singh, his son Shri 
Bhagwantpal Singh (since deceased) filed a suit for 
possession of the land in suit in the year 2001, that is 
after almost 43 years of it being donated to the State. 
The suit was registered as Civil Suit No.98 of 2001 
before the Additional Civil Judge (Sr. Division), 
Samana. 
5. The appellant filed written statement denying the 
plaint allegations and also raising plea regarding the 
suit being barred by limitation and also urged that 
since no relief for declaration had been sought and the 
suit was only for relief for possession, it was not 
maintainable. It was specifically averred in the written 
statement that the land in suit had been donated by 
Shri Inder Singh for the purpose of establishing a 
Veterinary Hospital in the year 1958, and possession 
was also delivered. The State thereafter, from the 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 4 of 27 
 
funds of the State Government, constructed a 
Veterinary Hospital soon thereafter in the year 1958-
59, and since then, the same has been functional. 
6. On the basis of the pleadings, the Trial Court framed 
the following issues: - 
“1. Whether the plaintiff is owner of the suit 
land? OPP 
2. 
 If issue No.1 is proved, whether the plaintiff 
is entitled to the decree for possession of the 
suit land? OPP 
3. 
 Whether 
the suit 
as framed is not 
maintainable? OPD 
4. 
Whether the suit is within time ? OPP 
5. 
Relief.” 
 
7. The parties led evidence based on which the Trial 
Court decreed the suit vide order dated 20.05.2003. 
The findings recorded by the Trial Court are as follows: 
(i) As the defendant had raised the plea of adverse 
possession, therefore, they admitted the ownership 
of the plaintiffs; 
 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 5 of 27 
 
(ii)There being no document regarding the alleged gift, 
the same does not stand proved; 
(iii)  The mere resolutions of the Municipal Council are 
not sufficient to prove that the land had been 
donated by the father of the plaintiff. 
8. The Appellant-State preferred an appeal which was 
registered as C.A. No.44 of 2003. The Additional 
District Judge allowed the appeal of the appellant-
State setting aside the judgment of the Trial Court and 
dismissed the suit. The findings recorded by the 
Appellate Court are as follows: 
(i) The fact that the Veterinary Hospital had been 
established in 1958-59 and it was being run ever 
since then, the filing of the suit after more than 
four decades was barred by time. 
(ii) The owner of the property having allowed the State 
to take possession, construct the Veterinary 
Hospital, and run the same over the land in suit 
since 1958-59 itself proves that the land had been 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 6 of 27 
 
actually donated by Shri Inder Singh, father of the 
original plaintiff. 
(iii) Shri Inder Singh, during his lifetime, having never 
agitated about the construction of the hospital or 
the existence of the hospital building over the land 
in suit, also reflects that he had, in fact, donated 
the land in suit. 
(iv) The plaintiff, having admitted that, he had been 
witnessing the Veterinary Hospital being run over 
the land in suit since 1981 but did not take any 
steps thereafter also proves that, in fact, 
ownership had been transferred to the State in 
1958 itself. 
9. Aggrieved by the same, the plaintiff-respondent 
preferred a second appeal before the High Court 
registered as RSA No.447 of 2004. By the impugned 
order, the High Court has allowed the appeal, set 
aside the judgment of the First Appellate Court, and 
restored that of the Trial Court. The findings recorded 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 7 of 27 
 
by the High Court are as follows: 
(i) The Appellant-State failed to establish possession 
over the land in suit. 
(ii) The basic ingredients for claiming adverse 
possession were neither pleaded nor any evidence 
led in that regard. 
(iii)  The pleadings in the written statement filed by the 
appellant-State did not mention the details 
regarding 
the 
date 
of possession, 
date of 
knowledge to the whole world, duration of 
possession, and much less Animus Possidendi. 
10. It is this judgment of the High Court which is under 
challenge in the present appeal. 
11. Sri Sanjay R. Hegde, learned Senior Counsel 
appearing for the appellant made the following 
submissions:- 
(i) The suit for possession filed by the respondents, 
was clearly barred by time in view of Article 65 of 
the Limitation Act, 1963, which provides the 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 8 of 27 
 
limitation for a suit for possession of an immovable 
property based on title to be 12 years. In the 
present case, the possession of the appellants was 
since 1958, even the admitted position by the 
respondents to their knowledge was from 1981. As 
such, the suit filed in the year 2001 was hopelessly 
barred by time from both the dates i.e. 1958 as 
also 1981. 
(ii) The burden to prove ownership would lie on the 
person challenging the ownership of the person in 
possession in view of Section 110 of the Indian 
Evidence Act, 1872. In the present case, the 
respondents admitted the possession of the 
appellants 
and 
were 
only 
challenging 
the 
ownership of the appellants. As such, the burden 
was cast upon the respondents to prove their 
ownership. 
(iii)  The appellants had claimed to be in possession of 
the land in suit since 1958 and had also asserted 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 9 of 27 
 
that it had constructed a Veterinary Hospital soon 
thereafter, for which it had also filed documentary 
evidence. Sri Inder Singh, the predecessor in 
interest of the plaintiff-respondent, who had 
donated the land in suit for construction of 
Veterinary Hospital, never challenged the same nor 
ever objected to the constructions being raised 
over it. He was the owner in possession of the suit 
land. 
The 
appellants, 
being 
in 
clear 
and 
continuous possession of the suit land since 1958, 
had perfected its rights as owners. 
(iv)  In support of his submission, Sri Hegde, relied 
upon the following judgments:- 
(1) 
Chuharmal Vs. CIT1;  
(2) 
Ramchandra Sakharam Mahajan 
Vs. Damodar Trimbak Tanksale

judgment of the High Court deserves to be set-aside. 
13. Mr. 
Sidharth 
Luthra, 
learned 
Senior 
Counsel 
appearing for the respondents made the following 
submissions:- 
(i) The impugned judgment of the High Court did not 
suffer from any perversity, as such, did not 
warrant any interference by this Court. 
(ii) The plea of adverse possession was neither pleaded 
nor proved, as such the High Court rightly set

aside the judgment of the First Appellate Court 
which was based on the plea of adverse possession. 
(iii)  The State Government cannot claim adverse 
possession for which reliance was placed upon the 
following judgments:- 
(1) 
State of Kerala Vs. Joseph8;  
(2) 
State of Haryana Vs. Mukesh 
Kumar and Ors.9;  
(3) 
Karnataka Board of Wakf Vs. 
Government of India10; 
 
(iv)  No written deed of gift, much less registered, was 
placed on record by the appellants to support its 
claim of donation/gift by Sri Inder Singh. 
(v) The suit is not barred by limitation, in as much as, 
the respondents came to know of the construction 
only in September, 2000 and, thereafter, they 
immediately gave legal notice and filed the suit for 
possession.

(vi) The revenue records (Jama bandis) established the 
ownership 
rights 
of 
the 
respondents. 
The 
submission to the contrary by the appellants is 
contrary to law. The revenue records carried 
presumption of correctness unless rebutted. In the 
present case, the appellants failed to rebut the said 
presumption. He relied upon the following 
judgments in support of the said submission: - 
(1) Partap Singh Vs. Shiv Ram11;  
(2) 
Vishwa Vijai Bharti Vs. Fakhrul 
Hasan and Ors12; 
 
(vii). Lastly, it was submitted by Sri Luthra that the 
appeal was filed with a delay of 492 days without 
any satisfactory explanation. As such, the appeal 
was liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay 
itself. In support of the said submission, he relied 
upon the following two judgments:- 
(1) 
State 
of 
Madhya 
Pradesh 
Vs. 
 
11 (2020) 11 SCC 242

14. Having considered the submissions and having 
perused the material available on record, our analysis 
runs as under. 
 
15. A copy of the plaint filed by the respondents is filed as 
Annexure (P-18). It is as vague as possible and is very 
brief running into ten paragraphs. Its contents are 
briefly referred to hereunder:- 
(a) The plaint schedule property is described in the 
beginning of the plaint. Paragraph-1 states that 
plaintiff is owner of the land in dispute, for which, 
Jama Bandi of the year 1996-97 is filed. 
Paragraph-2 states that defendants without 
consent of plaintiff have constructed a veterinary 
 
13 (2020) 10 SCC 654 
14 (2012) 3 SCC 563 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 14 of 27 
 
hospital illegally and unauthorizedly over the suit 
land. Paragraph-3 states that the defendants 
neither purchased the said land from the plaintiff 
nor paid any compensation to the plaintiff, as such, 
their possession is unauthorized and illegal. The 
plaintiff being its owner is entitled to vacant 
possession. Paragraph 4 states that despite 
repeated request to hand over vacant possession 
by removing the debris (malba), no heed has been 
paid to the said request. Paragraph-5 mentions 
that a registered notice dated 09.11.2000 was 
served upon the defendants calling upon them to 
hand over possession, but no reply was received in 
response to the same. Copy of the notice and 
acknowledgement of receipt were attached with the 
plaint. Paragraph-6 states that cause of action 
arose on 1st March, 2001 as the defendants did not 
give any reply to the notice. Paragraph-7 states 
that suit property was situated within the 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 15 of 27 
 
jurisdiction of the Court. Paragraph-8 mentions 
regarding the valuation and the court fee paid. 
Paragraph-9 mentions that there was no prior 
litigation pending between the parties regarding 
the subject matter. Paragraph-10 is the relief 
clause wherein it was prayed that suit of plaintiff 
for possession of the suit property be decreed. 
 
16. The plaint, to our opinion ought to have been rejected 
on the ground of being vague and not carrying 
necessary and material particulars. The plaintiff very 
conveniently avoided stating in the plaint as to when 
the defendants constructed the Veterinary Hospital; 
they also did not mention any details of the period 
when request was said to have been made for 
delivering vacant possession; the first date and 
document mentioned in the plaint is of the legal notice 
dated 09.11.2000. 
 
17. In the case of Ram Singh Vs. Gram Panchayat Mehal 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 16 of 27 
 
Kalan15, this Court observed and held that when the 
suit is barred by any law, the plaintiff cannot be 
allowed to circumvent that provision by means of 
clever drafting so as to avoid mention of those 
circumstances, by which the suit is barred by law of 
limitation. 
 
18. Herein, it is evident that the plaintiff purposely 
drafted/filed a vague plaint which lacked the essential 
details of when the hospital was constructed, when 
the plaintiff became aware of such construction, when 
the right of ownership devolved upon the plaintiff, 
when his father passed away, his letter of 24.04.1981 
to the Tehsildar etc. It is nothing but a clear attempt 
by Respondent at surpassing the bar under limitation 
law for filing the suit since the existence of the 
hospital was a fact well known to him since long ago. 
 
19. The appellants filed their written statement denying 
 
15 (1986) 4 SCC 364 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 17 of 27 
 
the plaint allegations; three preliminary objections 
were also raised to the effect that suit was not 
maintainable in its form; the appellants were in 
continuous possession over the suit land and; the suit 
was time barred. It was further specifically stated that 
the land in suit was donated by Sri Inder Singh in 
1958 for construction of Government Veterinary 
Hospital and, further, Municipal Council, Samana 
and the State of Punjab had made financial 
contribution for construction of the building of the 
hospital in the year 1959 and since then, the hospital 
is functioning, which is well known to the public of 
Samana as also to the plaintiff. In support of the fact 
that the hospital was constructed and that the 
possession was with the State-appellant, various 
resolutions of 1958-59, other revenue records were 
filed. It was also specifically stated that as the land 
had been donated, there was no question of payment 
of consideration or compensation to the plaintiff. 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 18 of 27 
 
 
20. A replication was filed by the plaintiff-respondent. 
 
21. Plaintiff examined himself as P.W.-1 and filed 
documentary evidence which were exhibited. On the 
other hand, the State examined Dr. Rajendra Kumar 
Goyal as D.W-1 and Jagdish Chand as D.W.-2 and 
had also filed several documents relating to 
resolutions passed by the Municipal Council in the 
year 1958-59, also the correspondence between the 
Veterinary Officer and the Executive Officer of the 
Municipal Council sometimes in 1981, as also the 
documents to show that the plaintiff was aware of the 
existence of the Veterinary Hospital in the year 1981 
as he had made an enquiry from the concerned 
Tehsildar regarding the exact location of the 
Veterinary Hospital. 
 
22. A perusal of all such documents (Ex's- DW2/C, 
DW2/B, D-2, D-3, D-4 and D-5) filed by the 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 19 of 27 
 
defendant-State clearly establishes that the land had 
been donated by Sri Inder Singh, father of the plaintiff 
in the year 1958-1959 and, thereafter, after arranging 
for funds from various sources, the hospital had been 
constructed in 1959 and has, eversince then, been 
functional. The above documents are resolutions of 
the Municipal Council of 1958-59 and also Utilization 
Certificates of funds utilized for construction of the 
hospital. The document (Ex.DW2/A) also goes to 
prove that there was a communication from the 
Executive Officer of the Municipal Council dated 
01.07.1981 giving details of the allotment, the 
construction, the finances and also the functionality 
of the hospital. This communication further mentions 
that somebody had destroyed the file of the gift and 
the construction of the hospital for which an enquiry 
was pending. Nevertheless, the facts stated therein 
clearly reflect that there was a hospital in existence 
much before 1981. Another document filed by the 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 20 of 27 
 
defendant-appellant was Ext.-D (8), which is a letter 
written by the plaintiff dated 24.04.1981 requiring the 
Tehsildar, Samana to verify and give a report 
regarding location of the Veterinary Hospital. The said 
letter also bears endorsement of the Tehsildar and 
other Revenue Officials and also contains the 
signature of the plaintiff. This letter clearly shows that 
the plaintiff was aware of the existence of the 
Veterinary Hospital in 1981. Thus, he had made a 
false and incorrect statement in his deposition that 
the hospital was constructed only two years ago. 
Another fact worth mentioning here would be that, 
during cross examination, the plaintiff stated that he 
did not remember as to whether the hospital was in 
existence since 1958-59 or not. 
 
23. Considering this letter dated 24.04.1981, even if we 
assume that the Respondent became aware of the 
hospital’s existence on this date for the very first time, 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 21 of 27 
 
yet the suit filed by him shall not fall within the 
limitation period. Article 65 of the Limitation Act 
clearly stipulates that in a suit for possession of 
immovable property, the period of limitation will be 
twelve years from when the possession of the 
defendant becomes adverse to the plaintiff. In the 
facts and circumstances of the case, the Respondent-
plaintiff’s suit is clearly barred by limitation. 
 
24. The argument that State could not claim adverse 
possession is not germane to the present case. Fact 
remains and has been duly established from the 
record that the hospital had been constructed on the 
land belonging to the predecessor in interest of the 
plaintiff sometime in the year 1958-59. At that time, 
Sri Inder Singh, father of the plaintiff who was the 
owner of the said land was alive and he did not object 
to it, which clearly indicates that he had donated the 
land for construction of Veterinary Hospital in Tehsil, 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 22 of 27 
 
Samana. In those good old times, it used to be a usual 
practice of big landlords donating their lands for 
public cause. It is unfortunate that after 43 years, his 
son filed the suit for possession without seeking 
declaration, as in case, he would have sought relief of 
declaration, the suit would have been further barred 
by time for the said relief also. The defendant having 
been in possession without any hindrance since 1958, 
the suit filed would only be a mockery of justice if 
decreed. If the plaintiff's case was that it was never 
donated but still the hospital had been constructed, 
then the plaintiff should have instituted a suit for 
possession within 12 years. Having not done so, the 
suit was clearly barred by time for the relief of 
possession. 
 
25. As already discussed above, various documents were 
filed and proved by the defendant-appellant regarding 
the donation, the transfer of possession, the 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 23 of 27 
 
construction of the Veterinary Hospital and its 
functionality since more than 40 years before the suit 
was filed. In fact, the evidence establishes that the 
donation 
was 
documented, 
and 
possession 
transferred and acted upon and for the very purpose, 
for which the donation was made. 
 
26. The title of the land in suit had passed on to the State 
after the donation and transfer of possession and after 
construction, the hospital continued for more than 
four decades before filing of the suit. The plaintiff, son 
of the donor, also waited for 20 years despite admitted 
knowledge of the hospital running over the land in 
suit and did not take any action. 
 
27. Article 65 under the Schedule to the Limitation Act 
provides limitation of 12 years for filing a suit for 
possession based on title. In the present case, merely 
because the name of the plaintiff continued in the 
revenue records (Jama Bandis), it would not confer 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 24 of 27 
 
any title upon him. Revenue records (Jama Bandis) 
are only entries for the purpose of realising tax by the 
Municipal Corporations or land revenue by Gram 
Sabhas. The plaintiff having failed to claim relief of 
declaration, the suit itself would not be maintainable. 
Further, for a suit for declaration, period of limitation 
would be three years under Article 58 of the Schedule 
to the Limitation Act, which in the present case was 
long lost. 
 
28. There is nothing on record available from the cross-
examination of defendants 1 and 2 that the 
documents which they proved were either incorrect, 
doubtful or suspicious. The documents exhibited by 
the defendants could not be ignored as they were 
public documents, copies of which were filed and duly 
proved. Even if the deed was not placed on record but 
due explanation was given, the facts of the case and 
the evidence on record clearly established the case of 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 25 of 27 
 
the defendant-appellant that the land in suit had been 
donated by Sri Inder Singh, father of the plaintiff way 
back in 1958. The lethargy/carelessness on the part 
of the State in not getting the revenue records 
corrected on the basis of the gift deed would not take 
away the rights conferred on the State under the gift 
deed. 
 
29. The case-laws relied upon by Sri Luthra on the 
question of State not being entitled to claim adverse 
possession as also the presumption of revenue 
records being correct, have no application and are of 
no help to the respondents in the light of the 
discussion made above. 
 
30. It is settled law that in a suit for possession, the 
burden of proof lies on the plaintiff. As per Section 110 
of the Evidence Act, 1872, the burden of proof as to 
ownership of a property lies on the person challenging 
the ownership of the person in possession. Section 

SLP (CIVIL) D. NO. 17885 OF 2020      
Page 26 of 27 
 
110 of Evidence Act is produced as follows: 
 “110.Burden 
of 
proof 
as 
to 
ownership- 
When 
the 
question 
is 
whether any person is owner of anything 
of which he is shown to be in possession, 
the burden of proving that he is not the 
owner is on the person who affirms that 
he is not the owner.” 
 
31. This Court had summarized the provision in 
Chuharmal v. CIT (supra) as follows: 
“6. …Section 110 of the Evidence Act is 
material in this respect and the High 
Court relied on the same which stipulates 
that when the question is whether any 
person is owner of anything of which he is 
shown to be in possession, the onus of 
proving that he is not the owner, is on the 
person who affirms that he is not the 
owner. In other words, it follows from well 
settled principle of law that normally, 
unless contrary is established, title 
always follows possession.” 
 
32. In view of the clear finding that the hospital is 
functioning on the suit land since 1958, the Trial 
Court as well as the High Court have wrongly shifted
