judgment and order, the High Court held that the respondent 
Nos. 1 to 5 therein (appellants herein and the State of Rajasthan) 
are bound to purchase a total of 906 MW electricity from the 
successful bidders.  It, therefore, directed the writ petitioner- MB 
Power (respondent No.1 herein) and respondent No.7 - PTC India 
Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “PTC India”) in the said writ 
petition (respondent No.2 in the present appeals) to supply 200 
MW electricity to the respondents therein (appellants herein) 
within the limit of 906 MW.  It also directed the writ petitioner-
MB Power and PTC India, respondent No.7 in the said writ 
petition, to file an appropriate application before the respondent 
Nos. 1 to 5 in the said writ petition, within two weeks from the 
date of the order, complying with the necessary requisite 
conditions, including bank guarantee etc., as required in terms 
of the Request for Proposal (hereinafter referred to as “the RFP”).  
It further directed the respondent Nos. 1 to 5 in the said writ 
petition, for issuance of Letter of Intent (“LoI” for short) in respect 
of bid filed through PTC India for supplying 200 MW power from 
the power generating station of the writ petitioner i.e. MB Power 
at levelized tariff of Rs.5.517/Kwh, being in terms of their bid 

3 
 
qualified by the Bid Evaluation Committee (“BEC” for short) and 
ranked L-7.  It further directed the respondents No.1 to 5 in the 
said writ petition, to immediately within two weeks thereafter, 
execute the Power Purchase Agreement (“PPA” for short) with PTC 
India for procuring 200 MW power from the power generating 
station of MB Power, and then to start procuring power in 
accordance with law.  As an interim measure, it directed that the 
tariff to be actually paid by the procurer-respondents before it, 
shall be the interim tariff i.e. Rs.2.88 per unit, as specified by this 
Court in its interim order dated 28th September 2020, passed in 
I.A. No.83693 of 2020 in Civil Appeal No.2721 of 2020.  It further 
held that the final adoption of tariff to be paid to PTC India 
(respondent No.7 before it) under the PPA shall be subject to the 
final outcome of the said Civil Appeal No. 2721 of 2020, pending 
before this Court.   
BRIEF FACTS: 
2. 
The facts leading to the filing of these two appeals, as 
mentioned in Civil Appeal No. 6503 of 2022, are as under: 
2.1 The Government of India vide Notification dated 19th 
January 2005, notified the Competitive Bidding Guidelines 

4 
 
(hereinafter referred to as “the Bidding Guidelines”) under 
Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as 
“the Electricity Act”).  The objective of the said Bidding Guidelines 
is for introduction of competition and protection of consumer 
interest.   
2.2 On 21st September 2009, Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Prasaran 
Nigam Limited (hereinafter referred to as “RVPN”) filed Petition 
No.205 of 2009 before the Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory 
Commission (hereinafter referred to as “the State Commission”) 
seeking approval for procurement of 1000 MW of power by a 
competitive bidding process.  
2.3 On 28th May 2012, RVPN issued an RFP, inviting sellers to 
participate in the competitive bidding for procurement of 1000 
MW under the Bidding Guidelines. 
2.4 In the month of February 2013, bids were received from the 
bidders. 
2.5 On 4th April 2013, based on the preliminary evaluation of 
the non-financial bids by the BEC, 7 bidders were declared as 
qualified for opening of the financial bids.  The respondent No.1-

5 
 
MB Power herein was not a bidder in the above process.  
Respondent No.2-PTC India herein had submitted a bid for 1041 
MW, which it was to procure from five different generators.  PTC 
India is a power-trading licensee company, which had procured 
the bid document after depositing a Bid Bond.   
2.6 In the various meetings held between 17th April 2013 and 
22nd April 2013, the BEC had placed the bids received in 
ascending order, from lowest to the highest tariff as follows:

2.7 In the 216th Meeting of the Board of Directors of RVPN, it 
was decided to take an opinion from the BEC as to whether 
negotiations should be held to reduce tariff keeping in view of the 
long-term impact and quantum of the amounts involved.  
2.8 On 4th June 2013, the BEC gave its opinion that since the 
rates quoted vary considerably, negotiations could be held with 
the bidders.  
2.9 Vide Resolution dated 4th June 2013, the Board of the RVPN 
decided to hold negotiations with the qualified bidders.   
2.10 In the negotiations, the following offers were received: 
“ 
• L-1/Maruti Clean Coal & Power Ltd. 
offered an additional capacity of 55 
MW, aggregating to a total of 250 MW.  
 
• L-2/DB 
Power 
Limited,

2.11 The Board of Directors of the RVPN, in its meeting held on 
27th September 2013, directed that, LoI be issued in favour of the 
L-1, L-2 and L-3 bidders as under, subject to the approval of the 
State Commission while adopting the tariff.

2.12 In consonance with the LoI, on 1st November 2013, PPAs 
were signed with the L-1, L-2 and L-3 bidders.  Thereafter, RVPN 
filed Petition No.431 of 2013 before the State Commission under 

8 
 
Section 63 of the Electricity Act read with clause 5.16 of the 
Bidding Guidelines for adoption of tariff for purchase of long-term 
base load power of 1000 MW (±10%) as quoted by the successful 
bidders (being L-1, L-2 and L-3) under the Case-I bidding 
process.   
2.13 The Energy Assessment Committee (“EAC” for short), 
constituted by the Government of Rajasthan pursuant to 
Regulation 3 of the Power Procurement Regulations, in its 4th 
meeting held on 29th January 2014, recommended that there was 
no requirement for long term procurement of 1000 MW (±10%) 
power under Case-I for which PPAs had been executed and tariff 
adoption petition had been filed before the State Commission.  
2.14 In the meantime, the L-4 and L-5 bidders filed Writ Petitions 
being CWP No. 19437 of 2013 and CWP No.18699 of 2013 
respectively, before the High Court, seeking to strike down the 
negotiations process and the higher quantum awarded to L-1, L-
2 and L-3 bidders. 
2.15 The High Court vide judgment dated 7th February 2014, 
refused to entertain the writ petitions and relegated the parties 
to the State Commission.  The said order dated 7th February 2014 

9 
 
came to be challenged by the L-4 and L-5 bidders by way of writ 
appeals being DB Special Appeals (Writ) Nos. 538 of 2014 and 
604 of 2014.  The said appeals also came to be dismissed by the 
High Court vide judgment and order dated 18th April 2014. 
2.16 Subsequently, in its 5th meeting held on 21st May 2014, the 
EAC recommended that as against the quantum of 1000 MW 
power, for which PPAs had been executed and tariff adoption 
petition had been filed, a demand of 600 MW power ought to be 
considered, on account of availability of power from various 
sources and to meet future contingencies.   
2.17 The Government of Rajasthan, therefore, vide its letter 
dated 25th July 2014, issued to the RVPN, approved the purchase 
of a quantum of 500 MW power on long term basis as against the 
quantum of 1000 MW for which PPAs had already been executed.   
2.18 On the basis of the decision/recommendation of the EAC 
and the direction issued by the Government of Rajasthan, RVPN 
filed an application under Regulation 7 of the RERC (Power 
Purchase & Procurement Process of Distribution Licensee) 
Regulations 2004 (hereinafter referred to as “RERC Regulations 
2004”) in Petition No.431 of 2013, to bring on record the EAC 

10 
 
decision/recommendation and the Government of Rajasthan 
approval.  In the said application, inter alia, it was prayed for 
adoption of tariff and approval of the reduced quantum of 500 
MW of power to be purchased as against the original 1000 MW of 
power for which PPAs had already been executed with the 
successful bidders.  
2.19 Vide order dated 22nd July 2015 in Petition No.431 of 2013, 
the State Commission held that the quantum of only 500 MW 
power was liable to be approved considering the demand in the 
State as recommended by the EAC.  The State Commission also 
approved the tariff quoted by the L-1 to L-3 bidders.  
2.20 Aggrieved by the reduction of quantum by the State 
Commission, the L-2 and L-3 bidders preferred appeals before 
the learned Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (hereinafter referred 
to as “the learned APTEL”) being Appeal Nos. 235 of 2015 and 
191 of 2015 respectively.  
2.21 Two separate appeals were also preferred by the L-4 and L-
5 bidders, being Appeal No. 264 of 2015 and Appeal No. 202 of 
2015 respectively, wherein apart from challenging the reduction 
of quantum by the State Commission from 1000 MW to 500 MW, 

11 
 
the increase in quantum granted to the L-1, L-2 and L-3 bidders 
was also challenged.   
2.22 Vide order dated 2nd February 2018, the learned APTEL 
allowed the Appeal Nos. 191 of 2015 and 235 of 2015, filed by 
the L-3 and L-2 bidders, holding that the reduction of quantum 
by the State Commission from 1000 MW to 500 MW was 
incorrect.  It, therefore, directed the State Commission to pass 
consequential orders for approving the PPAs for the L-2 and L-3 
bidders for the higher quantum which was negotiated.  
2.23 The order of the learned APTEL dated 2nd February 2018, 
was challenged by the present appellants before this Court by 
way of Civil Appeal Nos. 3481-3482 of 2018, on the ground that 
the RFP quantum cannot be restored from 500 MW to 1000 MW.  
Subsequently, Civil Appeal Nos. 2502-2503 of 2018 also came to 
be filed by L-5 bidder- SKS Power Generation (Chhattisgarh) 
Limited (hereinafter referred to as “SKS Power”), on the ground 
that the State Commission could not have permitted the 
procurement of higher quantum by the L-2 and L-3 bidders.   
2.24 Vide order dated 25th April 2018, the said Civil Appeals were 
disposed of by this Court, upholding the decision of the learned 

12 
 
APTEL, setting aside the reduction of quantum of procurement 
from 1000 MW to 500 MW after the bidding process was over.  
However, this Court held that the decision of the learned APTEL 
on the quantum to be procured from individual bidders was liable 
to be reversed and that the quantum originally offered by the 
bidders in the bidding process has to be taken into consideration 
and increase in quantum by means of negotiation was not 
permissible.  Insofar as L-4 and L-5 bidders are concerned, since 
the tariff quoted was not considered at any stage by either the 
procurer, or by RVPN or by the State Commission, this Court 
directed the State Commission to go into the issue of approval for 
adoption of tariff with regard to L-4 and L-5 bidders.   
2.25 Subsequent to the judgment and order dated 25th April 
2018, passed by this Court, the BEC came to a finding that the 
tariffs quoted by the L-4 and L-5 bidders were not aligned to the 
prevailing market prices.  
2.26 In the meantime, vide order dated 19th November 2018, this 
Court, on an application filed by RVPN, directed the State 
Commission to go into the issue of adoption of tariff in terms of 

13 
 
Section 63 of the Electricity Act and the law laid down by this 
Court under the said provision.   
2.27 Vide order dated 26th February 2019, the State Commission 
held that the tariffs offered by the L-4 and L-5 bidders were not 
aligned to the prevailing market prices.  
2.28 Being aggrieved by the same, SKS Power (L-5 bidder) 
challenged the above order dated 26th February 2019 before the 
learned APTEL by way of Appeal No.224 of 2019.   
2.29 Vide the judgment and order dated 3rd February 2020, the 
learned APTEL allowed the appeal of the L-5 bidder – SKS Power 
and held that the State Commission had to necessarily adopt the 
tariff, and had no power to consider whether the tariff was aligned 
to market prices.  
2.30 Aggrieved by the same, the present appellants have filed 
Civil Appeal No. 1937 of 2020 and Civil Appeal No.2721 of 2020.  
Initially, the present appeals were tagged along with the said 
appeals. However, vide order dated 10th October 2023, the same 
have been de-tagged.  

14 
 
2.31 On an interlocutory application being I.A. No.83693 of 2020 
filed by L-5 bidder-SKS Power in Civil Appeal No. 2721 of 2020, 
an interim order 28th September 2020, came to be passed by this 
Court, holding that the L-5 bidder was entitled to supply power 
to the appellants at the tariff of Rs.2.88 per unit. 
2.32 It appears that subsequently thereafter on 14th December 
2020, a writ petition being Writ Petition No. 14815 of 2020 came 
to be filed by the respondent No.1-MB Power before the High 
Court, seeking following relief: 
"(a)  Issue appropriate Writ or order or 
direction in the nature of declaration or 
certiorari or any other writ or direction 
declaring Rule 69(2)(b) of the RTPP Rules as 
ultra vires Article 14, 19(1)(g) and 21 of the 
Constitution of India as well as Section 63 of 
the Electricity Act, 2003;  
(b)  Issue appropriate Writ or order or 
direction in the nature of mandamus 
directing the Respondent Nos. 1-4 to 
immediately issue a Letter of Intent in favour 
of the Petitioner, sign the power Purchase 
Agreement with the Petitioner as per its bid 
tariff, take steps for adoption of tariff of the 
Petitioner 
and 
immediately 
commence 
supply of power;  

15 
 
(c)  
Pass such further order(s) as this 
Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the 
facts and circumstances of the instant case 
in the interest of justice.” 
 
2.33 In the appeals filed by the present appellants, i.e., Civil 
Appeal Nos. 1937 of 2020 and 2721 of 2020, respondent No.1-
MB Power filed an application for impleadment, on the ground 
that the issue of role of the State Commission in adoption of tariff 
being decided by this Court in the said appeals would have an 
impact on the writ petition filed by it before the High Court.   
2.34 Vide order dated 19th April 2021, this Court directed the 
said application for impleadment to be considered at the stage of 
hearing of the said appeals.   
2.35 By the impugned judgment and order, the said writ petition 
filed by MB Power has been allowed by the High Court in terms 
of the aforesaid directions. 
2.36 Hence the present appeals.  
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4612 OF 2023 
3. 
This appeal filed by Rajasthan Urja Vikas Nigam Limited 
(hereinafter referred to as “RUVNL”) challenges the order dated 

16 
 
1st June 2023, passed by the learned APTEL, whereby the learned 
APTEL has stayed the operation of the order dated 31st March 
2023, passed by the State Commission in Petition No.RERC-2097 
of 2023.  
4. 
The facts, in brief, leading to the filing of Civil Appeal 
No.4612 of 2023, are as under: 
4.1 In the year 2022, the RUVNL had proposed the procurement 
of 294 MW of power on long term basis and for that purpose had 
filed Petition No.2017 of 2022 before the State Commission. 
4.2 Vide order dated 2nd November 2022, the State Commission 
rejected the procurement of power on long term basis. 
4.3 Thereafter, considering the assessment and requirement of 
power, the RUVNL filed Petition No.RERC-2097 of 2023 before 
the State Commission, seeking approval for procurement of 160 
MW of power on medium term basis i.e., for a period of 5 years 
and not for 25 years on long term basis. 
4.4 Vide order dated 31st March 2023, the State Commission 
granted approval to the distribution licensees in the State of 
Rajasthan for procurement of 160 MW round-the-clock fuel 

17 
 
agnostic power on medium term basis by way of a competitive 
bidding process.   
4.5 Aggrieved thereby, the respondent No.1 herein, i.e., MB 
Power (Madhya Pradesh) Limited filed Appeal No. 466 of 2023 
before the learned APTEL against the order dated 31st March 
2023 passed by the State Commission, along with I.A. No.1004 
of 2023 for the stay of the order.  
4.6 Vide impugned order dated 1st June 2023, the learned 
APTEL stayed operation of the order passed by the State 
Commission and directed that in the bidding process for 
procurement of 160 MW of power on medium term basis the bid 
shall neither be finalized nor shall any Letter of Intent be issued 
pursuant to the opening of the bids. 
4.7 Aggrieved thereby, the RUVNL has filed the present appeal.  
5. 
Vide order dated 26th September 2023, this Court had 
permitted the appellant to proceed further with the tender 
process for procurement of 160 MW of power for 5 years on the 
basis 
of 
model 
bidding 
documents 
for 
medium 
term 
procurement.  

18 
 
6. 
Vide order dated 10th October 2023, this Court had been 
informed that pursuant to the aforesaid order dated 26th 
September 2023, bids had been opened and the lowest bid was 
at Rs.5.30 per unit.  As a result, this Court had clarified that the 
pendency of the present appeal would not come in the way of the 
appellant in finalizing the tender and executing power purchase 
agreement with the successful bidders and the appellant would 
be at liberty to do so in order to overcome the difficulty of power 
shortage.  
7. 
The order of the learned APTEL dated 1st June 2023 
basically relies on the judgment of the Division Bench of the High 
Court of Judicature for Rajasthan, bench at Jaipur, passed in 
D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 14815 of 2020, which is a subject 
matter of challenge in Civil Appeal Nos. 6503 of 2022 and 6502 
of 2022. As such, the result of Civil Appeal No.4612 of 2023 
would depend upon the outcome of Civil Appeal Nos. 6503 of 
2022 and 6502 of 2022. 
SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANTS  
8. 
We have heard Shri P. Chidambaram, learned Senior 
Counsel appearing for the appellants, and Dr. A.M. Singhvi and 

19 
 
Shri C.S. Vaidyanathan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for 
the respondents. 
9. 
Shri Chidambaram, at the outset, submits that the writ 
petition, filed by the respondent No.1-MB Power, was not 
maintainable before the High Court in its original jurisdiction 
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.  It is submitted 
that, if the respondent No.1-MB Power had any grievance, it 
could have either approached the State Commission or the 
learned APTEL.   
10. He submits that this Court in the case of PTC India 
Limited v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, 
Through Secretary1 has held that the Electricity Act is an 
exhaustive code on all matters concerning electricity.  The 
Electricity Act provides for the forum for adjudication of all 
disputes between a generator and the procurer/licensee.  As 
such, the respondent No.1-MB Power, if had any grievance, ought 
to have filed an application before the State Commission or the 
 
1 (2010) 4 SCC 603=2010 INSC 146 

20 
 
learned APTEL and it could not have approached the High Court 
directly in its writ jurisdiction.  
11. Shri Chidambaram further submitted that though L-1 to    
L-5 bidders have continuously been litigating their grievances 
from 2013 onwards, the respondent No.1-MB Power, since it was 
not short-listed, had taken no steps from 2013 onwards.  It is 
submitted that, as a matter of fact, the bid of L-7 bidder was 
returned and on 6th January 2015, the Bid Bond bank guarantee 
was also directed to be not extended.  Still, it kept silent for about 
6 years.  He further submits that even after the judgment and 
order was passed by this Court on 25th April 2018, respondent 
No.1-MB Power did not take any steps for about two years, and 
for the first time, on 14th December 2020, it filed a writ petition 
before the High Court.  As such, it is clear that the respondent 
No.1-MB Power had acquiesced the direction by the appellants 
dated 6th January 2015 not to renew the Bid Bond bank 
guarantee.  Shri Chidambaram, therefore, submits that the writ 
petition was liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay and 
laches itself. 

21 
 
12. Shri Chidambaram further submits that the term 
“successful bidder” has been defined in the RFP.  It is submitted 
that 
the 
bidder(s) 
selected 
by 
the 
procurer/authorized 
representative, pursuant to the RFP for supply of power by itself 
or through the project company as per the terms of the RFP, and 
to whom a LoI has been issued, can only be termed as the 
“successful bidder”.  Since no LoI was issued to the respondent 
No.1-MB Power, it could not be construed as a “successful 
bidder”. 
13. Shri Chidambaram submits that the theory of “filling the 
bucket”, as put forth by the respondent No.1-MB Power, has no 
basis either in the RFP or in the Bidding Guidelines.  It is further 
submitted that the said theory is a dangerous proposition 
inasmuch as, it is expected that the procurer would be obliged to 
accept the bids of lower ranked financial bids, irrespective of the 
exorbitant tariff quoted by them.  Shri Chidambaram has given 
an illustration to that effect that, if in a bid to procure 1000 MW, 
2 bidders can be put forward as stalking horses who would bid 
lower tariffs and are ranked as L-1 and L-2.  Thereafter, L-3 
onwards can quote exorbitant tariffs which are not aligned to 

22 
 
market prices.  He submits that this specious theory of “filling 
the bucket”, which would oblige the procurer to go to the last 
bidder, irrespective of their tariffs being completely exorbitant, is 
very dangerous. It is submitted that, in any case, clause 3.5.12 
of the RFP enables the procurer to reject any bid where the 
quoted tariff is not aligned to market prices.   
14. Shri Chidambaram further submits that the directions 
issued by this Court vide order dated 25th April 2018, were 
specifically restricted to L-1 to L-5 bidders, which were litigating.  
It is submitted that the contention of the respondent No.1-MB 
Power that the order of this Court dated 25th April 2018 was an 
order in rem is erroneous.   
15. Relying on the judgment of this Court in the case of R. 
Viswanathan and others v. Rukn-ul-Mulk Syed Abdul Wajid 
since deceased and others2, Shri Chidambaram submits that 
the judgment in rem settles the destiny of the res itself.  Whereas 
an order in personam determines the rights of persons before the 
Court and binds only the parties to the lis. Reliance in this 
 
2 (1963) 3 SCR 22=AIR 1963 SC 1=1962 INSC 205 

23 
 
respect is also placed on the judgment of this Court in the case 
of Deccan Paper Mills Company Limited v. Regency Mahavir 
Properties & Ors.3   
16. Shri Chidambaram further submits that the reliance by the 
respondents on the certificate, which certified the bid evaluation 
process was carried out in conformity with the provisions of the 
RFP, and, therefore, it is not permissible to go into the 
determination of tariff is incorrect.  He submits that the 
certificate is not certifying that L-7 was qualified to be selected 
as a “successful bidder” or it had earned a right to have his bid 
accepted irrespective of the quoted tariff.  He submits that if the 
quoted tariff of L-4 bidder of Rs.5.143 and L-5 bidder of Rs.5.300 
were misaligned, then, most certainly, the quoted tariff of L-7 
bidder of Rs.5.517 was also misaligned.   
17. The learned Senior Counsel submits that the jurisdiction 
under Section 63 of the Electricity Act is not that of a mere post 
office.  The State Commission has a power to reject the adoption 
of tariff if it is not aligned to market prices. In this respect, he 
 
3 (2021) 4 SCC 786=2020 INSC 497 

24 
 
refers to the judgments of this Court in the cases of Tata Power 
Company Limited Transmission v. Maharashtra Electricity 
Regulatory Commission & Ors.4 and Energy Watchdog v. 
Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and others5. 
18. Shri Chidambaram submits that the State Commission 
while adopting the tariff is bound to take into consideration the 
protection of consumer interest.  Reliance in this respect has 
been placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of GMR 
Warora Energy Limited v. Central Electricity Regulatory 
Commission (CERC) & Ors.6, wherein this Court has 
emphasized the need for balancing the interest of the consumers 
with that of the generators.  
19. Shri Chidambaram further submits that in view of clauses 
2.15.1 and 3.5.12 of the RFP and clause 5.15 of the Bidding 
Guidelines, the appellants had the power to reject all price bids 
if the rates quoted are not aligned to the prevailing market prices.   
20. Shri Chidambaram lastly submitted that the bidders have 
no vested right to contract.  Article 226 of the Constitution of 
 
4 2022 SCC Online 1615=2022 INSC 1220 
5 (2017) 14 SCC 80=2017 INSC 338 
6 2023 SCC Online SC 464=2023 INSC 398 

25 
 
India cannot be used to award a contract in favour of the bidder.  
In this respect, he refers to the following judgments of this Court: 
i. 
Tata Cellular v. Union of India7 
ii. 
Rajasthan Housing Board and another v. G.S. 
Investments and another8 
iii. 
Laxmikant and others v. Satyawan and others9 
21. Shri Chidambaram, therefore, submits that the impugned 
judgment and order is not sustainable and is liable to be set 
aside.  
SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS 
22. Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel, per contra, 
submits that unlike Section 62 read with Sections 61 and 64 of 
the Electricity Act, under Section 63 of the Electricity Act, the 
appropriate Commission only “adopts” tariff and does not 
“determine” tariff.  However, in cases under Section 63 of the 
Electricity Act, the Central Commission is bound by the 
guidelines issued by the Central Government and it is required 
 
7 (1994) 6 SCC 651 (para 94)= 1994 INSC 283 
8 (2007) 1 SCC 477 (para 8, 9 and 11)= 2006 INSC 766 
9 (1996) 4 SCC 208=1996 INSC 409 

26 
 
to exercise its regulatory functions, albeit under Section 79(1)(b) 
only in accordance with those guidelines.  In this respect, he 
relies on the judgment of this Court in the case of Energy 
Watchdog (supra) and Tata Power Company Limited 
Transmission (supra). 
23. Dr. Singhvi submits that two issues that can be considered 
in a case under Section 63 of the Electricity Act by the 
Commission are:  
(1) as to whether the bidding process was transparent; and 
(2)  as to whether the bidding process was held in 
accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central 
Government.   
24. He submits that once the tariff is an outcome of the bidding 
process and the bidding process is transparent and held in 
accordance with the Bidding Guidelines, the appropriate 
Commission is mandated to adopt such tariff and it does not have 
a discretion to go into the question as to whether it is market 
aligned or not.  
 

27 
 
25. Dr. Singhvi further submits that while adopting an already 
determined tariff by the bidding process as per Section 63 of the 
Electricity Act, the issue of market alignment of respondent 
No.1’s bid does not and cannot arise for consideration in these 
proceedings.  
26. Without prejudice to the aforesaid submissions, Dr. Singhvi 
submits that it is not permissible for the State Commission to go 
into the question of market alignment.  He submitted that the 
respondent No.1’s quoted tariff was market aligned not only in 
the year 2013 but also today.  Dr. Singhvi submits that in the 
recent tender for procurement of 160 MW electricity, conducted 
in pursuance to the permission granted by this Court, the lowest 
bid for 1st year tariff discovered and approved by the appellants 
is at Rs.5.30 per unit. It is submitted that there is a vast 
difference between “1st year tariff” and “levelized tariff”.  Dr. 
Singhvi submits that however, if this offer for supply in the first 
year of the bid is to be levelized for 25 years, it would come to 
Rs.7.91 per unit, which is around 50% higher than the 1st year 
tariff of the said bidder itself.   

28 
 
27. Dr. Singhvi submits that M/s Deloitte is a common 
consultant insofar as the appellants and the Uttar Pradesh Power 
Corporation Limited (“UPPCL” for short).  He submits that, in 
fact, BEC of UPPCL, in March 2013, accepted tariff up to Rs. 
5.849 per unit i.e., a tariff much higher than that of respondent 
No.1-MB Power.  It is submitted that the bidding period in the 
present case as well as in the case of UPPCL is the same.  It is 
submitted that, however, in 2018, the Rajasthan BEC 
mischievously and selectively considered tariff only up to 2012 
and compared bids of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, which were, 
in fact, discovered in 2015 and 2014 respectively.  It is submitted 
that similarly, in the State of Tamil Nadu, for the same period, 
the equivalent levelized tariff was determined by M/s Deloitte at 
Rs.5.75 per unit for 25 years and the same was accepted.  It is, 
therefore, submitted that, considering the aforesaid, the levelized 
tariff of the respondent No.1-MB Power for 25 years at Rs.5.517 
per unit is indisputably market aligned even as on 2012-2013. 
28. Dr. Singhvi, relied on the following charts to show that the 
levelized tariff for 25 years, as quoted by the respondent No.1-
MB Power, is very much market aligned.

29. Dr. Singhvi, the learned Senior Counsel, relying on clause 
3.5.9 of the RFP, submits that, no negotiations were permissible 
in spite of the specific clause in the RFP and the opinion to the 

30 
 
contrary given by the consultant.  It is submitted that the 
appellants tried to negotiate the prices with L-1 to L-3 bidders, 
which decision has been finally set aside by this Court vide order 
dated 25th April 2018.   
30. Dr. Singhvi submits that in view of the specific certificate 
dated 4th June 2013, issued by the BEC, certifying that the 
bidding procedure for the bids in question had been carried out 
by the appellants in conformity with the provisions of the RFP 
and the Bidding Guidelines issued by the Government of India, 
it is not permissible for the appellants to take a contradictory 
stand.   
31. Dr. Singhvi submits that what this Court had directed by 
order dated 25th April 2018, was to adopt the tariff with regard to 
L-4 and L-5 bidders.  By the subsequent order dated 19th 
November 2018, this Court clarified and directed to decide the 
tariff under Section 63 of the Electricity Act having regard to the 
law laid down both statutorily and by this Court.  It is submitted 
that the only scrutiny that could be done by the Commission was 
only with regard to the following of the twin requirements as 
observed by this Court in the case of Energy Watchdog (supra).   

31 
 
32. Dr. Singhvi submits that the power to reject the bids is in 
respect of all price bids.  He submits that if it is found that the 
bidding process was not transparent and the Guidelines were not 
followed or the bids are not market aligned, then the appellants 
would be entitled to reject all bids and not individually and 
selectively some bids.  He submits that if the interpretation as 
placed by the appellants is to be accepted, it will vest an arbitrary 
power with the procurer of energy to arbitrarily reject the bid of 
any of the bidders.  It is submitted that such an unfettered and 
unchecked discretion cannot be permitted to be exercised by the 
appellants/distribution companies (“DISCOMS”). 
33. Dr. Singhvi submits that insofar as the aspect with regard 
to “consumer’s interest” is concerned, the learned APTEL has 
squarely covered the same.  It has been held by the learned 
APTEL that the consumers’ interest is a broad term and among 
others, involves reliable, quality and un-interrupted power on 
long term basis besides being competitive.   
34. The learned Senior Counsel submits that the State of 
Rajasthan needed 1000 MW of power when it invited the bids in 
question.  He submits that the DISCOMS have even fairly 

32 
 
admitted that they are still in need of power and as such, filed an 
Interlocutory Application being I.A. No. 150366 of 2023 in Civil 
Appeal No.4612 of 2023 (for permission to file additional 
documents) seeking permission to procure power for medium 
term from the State Commission.  It is, therefore, submitted that 
even in the larger public interest and consumer interest, the 
appellants should procure the power from the respondent No.1-
MB Power. Dr. Singhvi submits that the appellants are bound to 
procure 906 MW of power in view of the orders passed by this 
Court on 25th of April 2018.  He submits that the RFP provides 
for bucket filling.  It is, therefore, submitted that the appellants 
are required to procure the power going down the ladder from the 
bidders starting from L-1 to the one till procurement of 906 MW 
of power is complete.  It is submitted that since many of the 
bidders had now gone into insolvency, it is only 3 bidders, which 
are left in the fray.  L-1 bidder is supplying 195 MW power and 
L-2 is supplying 311 MW power.  It is submitted that even in the 
event, this Court permits L-5 bidder to supply 100 MW power 
and 160 MW power for medium term in pursuance to the order 
passed by this Court on 26th September 2023, still the total would 

33 
 
not be beyond 766 MW.  Still the balance of 140 MW power would 
remain.  
35. Dr. Singhvi submits insofar as contention of the appellants 
with regard to delay and laches is concerned, the same is without 
substance.  He submits that only after the respondent No.1 came 
to know about the incapacity of L-3, L-4 and L-6 bidders to 
honour their offered capacity, the occasion to revalidate the claim 
of the respondent No.1 arose.  The learned Senior Counsel, 
relying on clause 3.5.6 of the RFP, submits that the selection 
process shall continue till the requisitioned capacity has been 
achieved through the summation of the quantum offered by the 
“successful bidders” or when the balance of the requisitioned 
capacity is less than the minimum bid capacity.  It is submitted 
that since there is still a gap of 140 MW, to comply with this 
Court’s order dated 25th April 2018, the appellants are bound to 
enter into PPAs with the qualified bidders until the entire 
requisitioned capacity of 906 MW is met.  
36. Dr. Singhvi relied on the following chart to show that the 
prices discovered in all medium and long term bids are much 

34 
 
higher than the levelized price quoted by the respondent No.1-
MB Power.

37. Dr. Singhvi, therefore, submits that, if the directions as 
issued by the High Court are maintained, it will be in the 
interests of the consumers, who will be getting the electricity at 
lesser prices than what has recently been emerged as a levelized 
price in the bidding process.  He submits that this is specifically 
so when indisputably even according to the appellants they are 

35 
 
in dire need of power.  Dr. Singhvi, therefore, prays for dismissal 
of the present appeals.  
38. Shri C.S. Vaidyanathan, learned Senior Counsel also 
addressed similar arguments and prayed for dismissal of the 
present appeals.  
CONSIDERATIONS 
39. For considering the rival submissions, it will be necessary 
to refer to some of the provisions of the Electricity Act, which are 
as under: 
“63.

40. It will also be relevant to refer to part of the preamble of the 
Bidding Guidelines notified by the Union of India vide Resolution 
dated 19th January 2005, which is as under: 
“These guidelines have been framed 
under the above provisions of section

42. It will also be relevant to refer to clause 5.15 of the Bidding 
Guidelines, which is as under: 
“5.15  
The bidder who has quoted 
lowest levellised tariff as per

be considered for the award.

selected 
by 
the 
Procurer/ 
Authorized Representative, as applicable 
pursuant to this RFP for supply of power by 
itself or through the Project Company as per 
the terms of the RFP Documents, and to 
whom a Letter of Intent has been issued;” 
 
44. The impugned judgment of the High Court is basically 
based on the judgment of the learned APTEL dated 3rd February 
2020 in the case of SKS Power and orders passed by this Court 
as already observed herein above.  After the bids were received 
for procurement of 1000 MW, the BEC decided to accept the bids 
of L-1, L-2 and L-3 bidders.  However, as the State government 
had recommended reduction of purchase to only 500 MW power, 
RVPN filed an application under Regulation 7 of the RERC 
Regulations 2004, for adoption of tariff of L-1 to L-3, so also 
allowing it to purchase only 500 MW of power as against 1000 
MW.  The said application was allowed by the State Commission.  
The State Commission also adopted the tariff determined through

the bidding process for purchase of 500 MW power vide its order 
dated 22nd July 2015.  The said order of the State Commission 
was challenged before the learned APTEL by M/s D.B. Power Ltd 
[L-2 bidder] and by M/s Lanco Power Ltd. [L-3 bidder] by way of 
Appeal Nos. 235 of 2015 and 191 of 2015 respectively. 
45. The learned APTEL in the said appeals, vide judgment and 
order dated 2nd February 2018, set aside the order of the State 
Commission dated 22nd July, 2015, and passed the following 
directions: 
“ORDER 
Hence, the Appeal Nos. 235 of 2015 and 191 
of 
2015 
are 
allowed 
and 
the 
State 
Commission’s order dated 22.07.2015 is set 
aside.  The State Commission is directed to 
pass consequential order in accordance with 
the law keeping in view our observations 
made above as well as the judgments of this 
Tribunal rendered earlier on the aspects of 
the scope of Section 63 of the Act as 
expeditiously as possible, preferably, within 2 
months from today.  No order as to costs.” 
 
46. After the learned APTEL passed the aforesaid order, M/s 
D.B. Power Ltd. (L-2 bidder) filed an Interlocutory Application 
before the State Commission, praying for passing forthwith 

44 
 
consequential orders in terms of the judgment of the learned 
APTEL. It also sought a direction to DISCOMS to start procuring 
power from it to the extent of 410 MW as per the PPA dated 1st 
November 2013.   
47. When the matter was heard by the State Commission on 8th 
March 2018, it was noticed that appeals against the order of the 
learned APTEL were pending before this Court.  
48. This Court disposed of the said appeals vide judgment and 
order dated 25th April 2018, and issued the following directions: 
"We are in agreement with the earlier 
conclusion of the APTEL. We are of the view 
that the direction of reduction of capacity 
from 1000 mw to 500 mw by the State 
Commission was correctly set aside. Since L-
1 to L-5 were represented before this Court, 
we direct that they shall be entitled to supply 
of power in terms of the originally offered 
amount, mentioned above, in accordance 
with para 3.5 of the Request for Proposal. The 
power supply will now be reduced to a total of 
906 mw. The State Commission may now go 
into the issue of approval for adoption of tariff 
with regard to L-4 and L-5. All Letters of 
Intent (LOIs) shall stand modified in terms of 
the above. All the appeals shall stand 
disposed of in terms of the above order." 
 

45 
 
49. Consequent to the orders passed by this Court, the State 
Commission vide its order dated 29th May 2018, directed 
RVPN/DISCOMS to file an appropriate application/petition in 
relation to L-3, L-4 and L-5 bidders.   
50. RVPN accordingly filed an application on 27th August 2018 
before the State Commission, submitting therein that the tariff of 
L-4 and L-5 bidders was very high and not aligned to market 
prices and, therefore, sought not to be adopted in terms of the 
competitive bidding guidelines and documents.   
51. In the meantime, a Contempt Petition came to be filed before 
this Court by SKS Power.  This Court vide order dated 20th 
September 2018, in the said Contempt Petition, issued the 
following directions: 
" We are of the view that there is no doubt 
whatsoever that now the PPA has to be 
signed between the parties. However, the 
State Commission, may, as per our order, 
go into the issue of approval of adoption 
of tariff with regard to L-5, who is the 
party before us, and will decide the same 
within a period of six weeks from today.  
 
PPA is to be signed immediately thereafter." 
[emphasis supplied] 
 

46 
 
52. Thereafter, SKS Power filed an Interlocutory Application on 
5th October 2018, praying for adoption of its tariff as per the 
orders of this Court dated 25th April 2018 and 20th September 
2018. 
53. It was contended before the State Commission by SKS 
Power that the State Commission was bound to adopt tariff as 
quoted by it.  However, per contra, it was contended by the RVPN 
and DISCOMS that since the tariff quoted by SKS Power was not 
market aligned, it could not be adopted.  In view of the counter 
submission, the State Commission vide its order dated 16th 
October 2018, gave an opportunity to the RVPN to file an 
amended application or seek direction on the issue from this 
Court. 
54. Accordingly, RVPN filed a Miscellaneous Application before 
this Court.  This Court vide order dated 19th November 2018, 
passed the following order: 
"Having heard learned counsels for both the 
parties, we only clarify that the Rajasthan 
Electricity Regulatory Commission [the State 
Commission) is to decide the tariff under-
Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 having 
regard to the law laid down both statutorily 
and by this Court.  

47 
 
 
The 
State 
Commission 
to 
finalise 
the 
aforesaid prices within a period of eight weeks 
from today.  
 
The MAs are disposed of accordingly." 
 
55.  A review application was also filed on behalf of the SKS 
Power.  The said review application was disposed of by this Court 
vide order dated 21st January 2019, with the following directions: 
"------. We find that as per the Standard 
Bidding Guidelines the PPA is first to be 
signed after which the question of adoption of 
tariff has to be taken up.  
 
With this clarification of the 20.09.2018 
order, we dispose of the review and the M.A. 
 
The State Commission which has reserved its 
judgment on 16.01.2019 will hear the parties 
within a period of two weeks from today and 
will pass orders after taking into account the 
order that we have passed today.” 
 
56. In accordance with the directions issued by this Court, the 
State Commission considered the rival submissions of the parties 
and came to a conclusion that the tariff quoted by SKS Power 
was not market aligned. The State Commission also found that, 
adoption of such high rate would be against the consumer 

48 
 
interest.  The State Commission, therefore, vide order dated 26th 
February 2019, decided not to adopt the tariff quoted by L-4 and 
L-5 bidders.   
57. The said order dated 26th February 2019 of the State 
Commission was challenged before the learned APTEL by SKS 
Power by way of Appeal No.224 of 2019. The learned APTEL 
framed the following three issues in the said appeal: 
“ISSUE NO.1: Whether 
the 
Respondent 
Commission could reject the 
tariff/bid of the Appellant, in 
terms of Section 63 of the 
Electricity Act, 2003 and the 
directions 
issued 
by 
the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court? 
 
ISSUE NO.2: 
Whether 
there 
was 
a 
sufficient proof to show that 
the bid of the Appellant was 
market aligned? 
 
ISSUE NO.3: 
Whether the argument of 
Consumer 
interest 
be 
advanced by the Rajasthan 
Discoms in the facts of the 
present Appeal?” 
 
58. The learned APTEL while answering the first issue, came to 
the conclusion that the State Commission, while adopting tariff 

49 
 
under Section 63, has to only consider that the Bidding 
Guidelines issued by the Central Government providing for tariff 
structure were complied with or not.  The learned APTEL also 
held that the State Commission cannot exercise its powers de 
hors such guidelines.  It further held that the State Commission 
has no power to reject the tariff of a bidder. 
59. Insofar as the second issue is concerned, the learned APTEL 
came to a finding that, since the bid of SKS Power was already 
evaluated, and the subsequent certificates were issued by the 
BEC confirming the transparency of the bid, it was not open for 
the State Commission to go into the question, as to whether the 
tariff quoted by SKS Power was market aligned or not.  It further 
held that, after the order dated 25th April 2018 was passed by 
this Court, it was not open for the State Commission to re-
evaluate the bid.   
60. Insofar as the third issue with regard to consumers’ interest 
is concerned, the learned APTEL held that the said issue cannot 
be raised again at that stage when the same had been dealt with 
in detail by the learned APTEL vide order dated 2nd February 

50 
 
2018 and also considered by this Court before passing the order 
dated 25th April, 2018. 
61. Accordingly, the appeal was allowed by the learned APTEL 
vide order dated 3rd February 2020 and the order dated 26th 
February 2019 of the State Commission was set aside.  The 
learned APTEL directed that the tariff of SKS Power, as offered in 
its bid, shall be adopted. The parties were directed to revive and 
implement the PPA dated 4th February 2019.  This order dated 
3rd February 2020, passed by the learned APTEL has been 
challenged by the DISCOMS and RVPN before this Court by way 
of Civil Appeal No.1937 of 2020 and Civil Appeal No. 2721 of 2020 
respectively. 
62. The respondent No.1 in the present proceedings rests its 
claim on the aforesaid orders passed by this Court and the order 
dated 3rd February 2020, passed by the learned APTEL. 
63. Basically, it is the contention of the respondent No.1-MB 
Power that after the orders were passed by this Court, RVPN and 
the DISCOMS were bound to procure electricity/power from the 
bidders going down the ladder until the entire 906 MW power was 
exhausted.  It is their contention that once it is certified that the 

51 
 
bid evaluation process has been complied with as per the Bidding 
Guidelines issued by the Central Government, it is presumed 
that the process was transparent and it is not permissible for the 
State Commission to go into the question of market aligned tariff 
and also the consumer interest.  It is their contention that 
without considering the question, as to whether the tariff was 
market aligned or not, the procurers were bound to accept supply 
from the bidders at the rates quoted by them.  It is their 
submission that the power under Section 63 of the Electricity Act 
restricted the scrutiny only to two aspects, viz., (1) whether the 
Bidding Guidelines framed by the Union of India under Section 
63 of the Electricity Act were followed; and (2) whether the 
bidding process was transparent or not. 
64. The High Court in the impugned judgment, relying on the 
observations of the learned APTEL and the earlier orders of this 
Court has come to a conclusion that, applying the test of “filling 
the bucket”, the procurers were bound to take supply from the 
respondent No.1-MB Power at the rates quoted by it.  On the 
basis of the judgment of the learned APTEL, the High Court held 
that the respondent No.1-MB Power had a right to supply power 

52 
 
since there was a gap of 300 MW between the power procured by 
the procurers and the ceiling of 906 MW determined by this 
Court.  In these premises, the High Court issued a mandamus 
directing 
the 
appellants 
to 
take 
supply 
of 
200 
MW 
electricity/power from the respondent No.1-MB Power at the 
rates quoted by it. 
65. We, therefore, find that, before deciding the correctness or 
otherwise of the impugned judgment, it will be necessary for us 
to examine the correctness of the judgment and order dated 3rd 
February 2020, passed by the learned APTEL in the case of SKS 
Power.   
66. We have already reproduced Section 63 of the Electricity 
Act.  The provisions of Section 63 of the Electricity Act fell for 
consideration before this Court in the case of Energy Watchdog 
(supra).  It will be apposite to refer to paragraphs 19 and 20 of 
the said judgment, which are as under: 
“19. The construction of Section 63, when 
read with the other provisions of this Act, is 
what comes up for decision in the present 
appeals. It may be noticed that Section 63 
begins with a non obstante clause, but it is a 
non obstante clause covering only Section 62. 

53 
 
Secondly, unlike Section 62 read with 
Sections 
61 
and 
64, 
the 
appropriate 
Commission does not “determine” tariff but 
only “adopts” tariff already determined under 
Section 63. Thirdly, such “adoption” is only if 
such tariff has been determined through a 
transparent process of bidding, and, fourthly, 
this transparent process of bidding must be 
in accordance with the guidelines issued by 
the Central Government. What has been 
argued before us is that Section 63 is a 
standalone provision and has to be 
construed on its own terms, and that, 
therefore, in the case of transparent 
bidding nothing can be looked at except 
the bid itself which must accord with 
guidelines 
issued 
by 
the 
Central 
Government. One thing is immediately 
clear, that the appropriate Commission 
does not act as a mere post office under 
Section 63. It must adopt the tariff which 
has 
been 
determined 
through 
a 
transparent process of bidding, but this 
can only be done in accordance with the 
guidelines 
issued 
by 
the 
Central 
Government. Guidelines have been issued 
under this section on 19-1-2005, which 
guidelines have been amended from time to 
time. Clause 4, in particular, deals with tariff 
and the appropriate Commission certainly 
has the jurisdiction to look into whether the 
tariff determined through the process of 
bidding accords with Clause 4. 
 

54 
 
20. It is important to note that the regulatory 
powers of the Central Commission, so far as 
tariff is concerned, are specifically mentioned 
in Section 79(1). This regulatory power is a 
general one, and it is very difficult to state 
that when the Commission adopts tariff 
under Section 63, it functions dehors its 
general regulatory power under Section 
79(1)(b). For one thing, such regulation takes 
place 
under 
the 
Central 
Government's 
guidelines. For another, in a situation where 
there are no guidelines or in a situation which 
is not covered by the guidelines, can it be said 
that the Commission's power to “regulate” 
tariff is completely done away with? According 
to us, this is not a correct way of reading the 
aforesaid statutory provisions. The first rule 
of statutory interpretation is that the statute 
must be read as a whole. As a concomitant of 
that rule, it is also clear that all the discordant 
notes struck by the various sections must be 
harmonised. Considering the fact that the 
non obstante clause advisedly restricts itself 
to Section 62, we see no good reason to put 
Section 79 out of the way altogether. The 
reason why Section 62 alone has been put out 
of the way is that determination of tariff can 
take place in one of two ways — either under 
Section 62, where the Commission itself 
determines the tariff in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act (after laying down the 
terms and conditions for determination of 
tariff mentioned in Section 61) or under 
Section 63 where the Commission adopts 
tariff that is already determined by a 
transparent process of bidding. In either case, 

55 
 
the 
general 
regulatory 
power 
of 
the 
Commission under Section 79(1)(b) is the 
source of the power to regulate, which 
includes the power to determine or adopt 
tariff. In fact, Sections 62 and 63 deal with 
“determination” of tariff, which is part of 
“regulating” tariff. Whereas “determining” 
tariff for inter-State transmission of electricity 
is dealt with by Section 79(1)(d), Section 
79(1)(b) is a wider source of power to 
“regulate” tariff. It is clear that in a situation 
where the guidelines issued by the Central 
Government under Section 63 cover the 
situation, the Central Commission is bound 
by those guidelines and must exercise its 
regulatory functions, albeit under Section 
79(1)(b), only in accordance with those 
guidelines. As has been stated above, it is only 
in a situation where there are no guidelines 
framed at all or where the guidelines do not 
deal 
with 
a 
given 
situation 
that 
the 
Commission's 
general 
regulatory 
powers 
under Section 79(1)(b) can then be used.” 
[emphasis supplied] 
 
67. It could thus be seen that it has been held by this Court 
that unlike Section 62 read with Sections 61 and 64, under the 
provisions of Section 63 of the Electricity Act, the appropriate 
Commission does not “determine” tariff but only “adopts” tariff 
already determined under Section 63.  It has further been held 
that, such “adoption” is only if such tariff has been determined 

56 
 
through a transparent process of bidding, and that, this 
transparent process of bidding must be in accordance with the 
guidelines issued by the Central Government.   It was sought to 
be contended before this Court in the said case that Section 63 
is a standalone provision and has to be construed on its own 
terms, and that, therefore, in the case of transparent bidding 
nothing can be looked at except the bid itself which must accord 
with guidelines issued by the Central Government. However, 
rejecting the said contention, this Court observed that the 
appropriate Commission does not act as a mere post office under 
Section 63. It has been observed that, Clause 4, in particular, 
deals with tariff and the appropriate Commission certainly has 
the jurisdiction to look into whether the tariff determined through 
the process of bidding accords with Clause 4. 
68. This Court in the said case, in paragraph 20, further 
observed that the entire Act shall be read as a whole.  It has been 
held that, all the discordant notes struck by the various sections 
must be harmonized.  It has been held that, considering the fact 
that the non obstante clause advisedly restricts itself to Section 
62, there is no reason to put Section 79 out of the way altogether.  

57 
 
It has been held that, either under Section 62, or under Section 
63, the general regulatory power of the Commission under 
Section 79(1)(b) is the source of the power to regulate, which 
includes the power to determine or adopt tariff. It has been held 
that, Sections 62 and 63 deal with “determination” of tariff, which 
is part of “regulating” tariff.  It has further been held that, in a 
situation where the guidelines issued by the Central Government 
under Section 63 cover the situation, the Central Commission is 
bound by those guidelines and must exercise its regulatory 
functions, albeit under Section 79(1)(b), only in accordance with 
those guidelines. It has further been held that, it is only in a 
situation where there are no guidelines framed at all or where the 
guidelines do not deal with a given situation that the 
Commission's general regulatory powers under Section 79(1)(b) 
can be used. 
69. The aforesaid view of this Court in the case of Energy 
Watchdog (supra), which is a judgment delivered by two Judge 
Bench, has been approved by three Judge Bench of this Court in 
the case of Tata Power Company Limited Transmission 
(supra). 

58 
 
70. We have already referred to Section 86(1)(b) of the Electricity 
Act, which is analogous to Section 79 of the Electricity Act.  
Section 79 determines the functions of Central Commission, 
whereas Section 86 provides for the functions of the State 
Commission.  Section 86 of the Electricity Act empowers the 
State 
Commission 
to 
regulate 
electricity 
purchase 
and 
procurement process of distribution licensees including the price 
at which electricity shall be procured from the generating 
companies or licensees or from other sources through 
agreements for purchase of power for distribution and supply 
within the State. 
71. It can thus be seen that Section 86(1)(b) of the Electricity 
Act gives ample power on the State Commission to regulate 
electricity purchase and procurement process of distribution 
licensees.  It also empowers the State Commission to regulate the 
matters including the price at which electricity shall be procured 
from the generating companies, etc.   
72. It will also be relevant to refer to the Bidding Guidelines 
notified by the Central Government vide Resolution dated 19th 
January 2005.  The preamble of the Bidding Guidelines 

59 
 
specifically states that, one of the objectives of the said Bidding 
Guidelines is to facilitate transparency and fairness in 
procurement processes and protection of consumer interests by 
facilitating competitive conditions in procurement of electricity.   
73. Clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines is an important 
clause. It provides that, the bidder who has quoted lowest 
levelized tariff as per evaluation procedure, shall be considered 
for the award.  It also provides that the evaluation committee 
shall have the right to reject all price bids if the rates quoted are 
not aligned to the prevailing market prices.   
74. It is thus amply clear that the evaluation committee is 
empowered to consider, as to whether the rates quoted are 
aligned to the market price or not, and that the evaluation 
committee shall have the right to reject all the price bids if it finds 
that the rates quoted are not aligned to the prevailing market 
price.   The orders which are relied upon by the learned APTEL, 
specifically the order dated 19th November 2018 of this Court, 
had specifically clarified that the State Commission was to decide 
the tariff under Section 63 of the Electricity Act having regard to 
the law laid down both statutorily and by this Court. 

60 
 
75. In this background, the State Commission was justified in 
considering clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines, which 
specifically permits to reject all price bids if the rates quoted are 
not aligned to the prevailing market prices.   
76. The contention that this Court has ordered that the bids 
quoted by the bidders are to be accepted without going into the 
question of it being market aligned or not, in our view, is without 
substance.  
77. If the contention of the respondent No.1-MB Power that the 
procurer is bound to accept all the bids emerged in a competitive 
bidding process once the bidding process was found to be 
transparent and in compliance with the Bidding Guidelines is to 
be accepted, in our view, it will do complete violence to clause 
5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines itself.   If that view is accepted, 
the DISCOMS will be compelled to purchase electricity at a much 
higher rate as compared with other suppliers.  The said higher 
rate will be passed on to the consumers.  As such, accepting the 
contention of the respondent No.1 would result in adversely 
affecting the interests of the consumers and, in turn, would be 
against the larger public interest.  For example, if in a bidding 

61 
 
process for 1000 MW power, 10 persons emerged as “qualified 
bidders”. L-1 bidder quotes Rs.2 per unit for 100 MW power and 
L-2 bidder quotes Rs.2.25 per unit for another 100 MW power 
and from L-3 bidder onwards, they start quoting Rs.10 per unit 
and above for balance 800 MW power, could the public interest 
be subserved by compelling the procurer to buy balance 800 MW 
power at Rs.10 per unit and above when the prices quoted are 
totally not aligned to market prices.   
78. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the learned 
APTEL has grossly erred in holding that the State Commission 
has no power to go into the question, as to whether the prices 
quoted are market aligned or not and also not to take into 
consideration the aspect of consumers’ interest.   
79. When the Bidding Guidelines itself permit the BEC to reject 
all price bids if the rates quoted are not aligned to the prevailing 
market prices, there is no question of the State Commission 
being not in a position to go into the question, as to whether the 
rates quoted are market aligned or not, specifically, in the light 
of ample powers vested with the State Commission under Section 
86(1)(b) of the Electricity Act, which also includes the power to 

62 
 
regulate the prices at which electricity shall be procured from the 
generating companies, etc.  The finding of the learned APTEL, in 
our view, therefore, is totally erroneous. 
80. In the case of SKS Power, the BEC, consisting of following 6 
members, has considered the levelized tariff quoted by L-4 and 
L-5 bidders: 
(i) 
Shri R.K. Jain, Chief Engineer (NPP & RA), RVPN, 
Jaipur; 
(ii) 
Shri Manish Saxena, Chief Controller of Accounts, 
RVPN, Jaipur; 
(iii) Shri M.M. Ranwa, Chief Engineer, RUVNL, Jaipur; 
(iv) 
Shri K.L. Meena, Addl. Chief Engineer (Fuel), RVUN, 
Jaipur; 
(v) 
Shri S.K. Mathur, Chief Engineer (HQ), JVVNL, 
Jaipur; and  
(vi) 
Shri Tarun Agarwal, CA, Partner M/s Shyamlal 
Agrawal & Co., Jaipur 
81. It can be seen that the said Committee consisted of 4 
technical members of the rank of Chief Engineer/Additional 

63 
 
Chief Engineer.  It consisted of the Chief Controller of Account, 
RVPN, Jaipur.  It also consisted of a Chartered Accountant, who 
is an expert in financial matters. After due deliberations, the BEC 
consisting of experts found that the prices quoted by L-4 and L-
5 bidders were exorbitantly high and it would result in additional 
financial burden of more than Rs.1715 crore on the consumers 
of the State as compared to the tariff of L-1 bidder. 
82. The State Commission after considering the detailed 
analysis of the BEC had come to the considered conclusion that 
the prices offered by SKS Power (L-5 bidder) were not market 
aligned, and therefore, not in the consumers’ interest.  We, 
therefore, find that the learned APTEL has grossly erred in 
reversing the well-reasoned order passed by the State 
Commission, which was, in turn, based on the decision of the 
BEC in accordance with clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines.  
83. We further find that it cannot be read from the orders of this 
Court that the State Commission was bound to accept the bids 
as quoted by the bidders till the bucket was filled. Firstly, no such 
direction can be issued by this Court de hors the provisions of 
Section 63 and 86(1)(b) of the Electricity Act and the Bidding 

64 
 
Guidelines.  In any event, vide order dated 19th November 2018, 
this Court had specifically directed the State Commission to 
decide the tariff under Section 63 of the Electricity Act having 
regard to the law laid down both statutorily and by this Court.  
As such, the State Commission was bound to take into 
consideration the Bidding Guidelines and specifically clause 5.15 
thereof.   
84. With regard to the contention that the power under clause 
5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines can be exercised only when the 
bidding process is found to be not in compliance with the Bidding 
Guidelines and is not transparent in respect of all the bidders 
and not in respect of some of the bidders is concerned, in our 
view, the same is without substance.   
85. We may in this respect refer to Section 13(2) of the General 
Clauses Act, which reads thus: 
“13. Gender and number.—In all Central 
Acts and Regulations, unless there is 
anything 
repugnant 
in 
the 
subject 
or 
context,—  
(1) …………………; and  
(2) words in the singular shall include the 
plural, and vice versa.” 
 

65 
 
86. Apart from that, the Constitution Bench of this Court in the 
case of Vivek Narayan Sharma and others v. Union of India 
and others10 had an occasion to consider the question, as to 
whether the word “any” would include “all” and vice versa.  The 
Constitution Bench of this Court observed thus: 
“113. It is strenuously urged by the learned 
Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 
petitioners that the word “any” used in sub-
section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act will 
have to be given a restricted meaning to mean 
“some”. It is submitted that if sub-section (2) 
of Section 26 of the RBI Act is not read in such 
manner, the very power available under the 
said sub-section will have to be held to be 
invalid on the ground of excessive delegation. 
It is submitted that it cannot be construed 
that the legislature intended to bestow 
uncanalised, unguided and arbitrary power 
on the Central Government to demonetise the 
entire 
currency. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
the 
submission of the petitioners that in order to 
save the said section from being declared 
void, the word “any” requires to be interpreted 
in a restricted manner to mean “some”. 
 
114. Per contra, it is submitted on behalf of 
the respondents that the word “any” under 
sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act, 
cannot be interpreted in a narrow manner 
 
10 (2023) 3 SCC 1=2023 INSC 2

and it will have to be construed to include 
“all”. 
Precedents construing the word “any” 
115. A Constitution Bench of this Court 
in Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam 
Chand 
Thapar [Chief 
Inspector 
of 
Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 
SCR 9 : AIR 1961 SC 838] was considering the 
question as to whether the phrase “any one of 
the Directors” as found in Section 76 of the 
Mines Act, 1952 could mean “only one of the 
Directors” or could it be construed to mean 
“every one of the Directors”. In the said case, 
all the Directors of the Company were 
prosecuted for the offences punishable under 
Sections 73 and 74 of the Mines Act, 1952. 
The High Court had held [Lala Karam Chand 
Thapar v. State of Bihar, 1958 SCC OnLine 
Pat 30] that any “one” of the Directors of the 
Company could only be prosecuted. 
 
116. The Constitution Bench of this Court 
observed thus : (Lala Karam Chand Thapar 
case [Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam 
Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 : AIR 1961 SC 
838] , AIR pp. 847-48, paras 29-34) 
“29. It is quite clear and indeed not 
disputed that in some contexts, “any one” 
means “one only it matters not which one” 
the phrase “any of the Directors” is 
therefore quite capable of meaning “only 
one of the Directors, it does not matter 
which one”. Is the phrase however capable 
of no other meaning? If it is not, the courts 
cannot look further, and must interpret 

67 
 
these 
words 
in 
that 
meaning 
only, 
irrespective of what the intention of the 
legislature might be believed to have been. 
If however the phrase is capable of another 
meaning, as suggested viz. “every one of the 
Directors” it will be necessary to decide 
which of the two meanings was intended by 
the legislature. 
30. If one examines the use of the words 
“any one” in common conversation or 
literature, there can be no doubt that they 
are not infrequently used to mean “every 
one” — not one, but all. Thus we say of any 
one can see that this is wrong, to mean 
“everyone can see that this is wrong”. “Any 
one may enter” does not mean that “only 
one person may enter”, but that all may 
enter. It is permissible and indeed profitable 
to turn in this connection to Oxford English 
Dictionary, at p. 378, of which, we find the 
meaning of “any” given thus:‘In affirmative 
sentences, it asserts, concerning a being or 
thing of the sort named, without limitation 
as to which, and thus collectively of every 
one of them’. One of the illustrations given is 
— “I challenge anyone to contradict my 
assertions”. Certainly, this does not mean 
that one only is challenged; but that all are 
challenged. It is abundantly clear therefore 
that “any one” is not infrequently used to 
mean “every one”. 
31. But, argues Mr Pathak, granting that 
this is so, it must be held that when the 
phrase “any one” is used with the 
preposition “of”, followed by a word 

68 
 
denoting a number of persons, it never 
means “every one”. The extract from Oxford 
Dictionary, it is interesting to notice, 
speaks of an assertion “concerning a being 
or thing of the sort named”; it is not 
unreasonable to say that, the word “of” 
followed by a word denoting a number of 
persons or things is just such “naming of a 
sort” as mentioned there. Suppose, the 
illustration 
“I 
challenge 
any 
one 
to 
contradict my assertions” was changed to 
“I challenge any one of my opponents to 
contradict my assertion”. “Any one of my 
opponents” here would mean “all my 
opponents” — not one only of the 
opponents. 
32. While the phrase “any one of them” 
or any similar phrase consisting of “any 
one”, followed by “of” which is followed in 
its turn by words denoting a number of 
persons or things, does not appear to have 
fallen for judicial construction, in our 
courts or in England — the phrase “any of 
the present Directors” had to be interpreted 
in an old English case, Isle of Wight 
Railway Co. v. Tahourdin [Isle of Wight 
Railway Co. v. Tahourdin, (1883) LR 25 Ch 
D 320 (CA)] . A number of shareholders 
required the Directors to call a meeting of 
the company for two objects. One of the 
objects was mentioned as ‘To remove, if 
deemed necessary or expedient any of the 
present Directors, and to elect Directors to 
fill any vacancy on the Board’. The 
Directors issued a notice to convene a 

69 
 
meeting for the other object and held the 
meeting. Then the shareholders, under the 
Companies Clauses Act, 1845, issued a 
notice of their own convening a meeting for 
both the objects in the original requisition. 
In an action by the Directors to restrain the 
requisitionists, from holding the meeting, 
the Court of Appeal held that a notice to 
remove “any of the present Directors” 
would justify a resolution for removing all 
who are Directors at the present time. 
“Any”, Lord Cotton, L.J. pointed out, would 
involve “all”. 
33. It is true that the language there was 
“any of the present Directors” and not “any 
one of the present Directors” and it is urged 
that the word “one”, in the latter phrase 
makes all the difference. We think it will be 
wrong to put too much emphasis on the 
word “one” here. It may be pointed out in 
this connection that the Permanent Edition 
of Words 
and 
Phrases, 
mentions 
an 
American 
case Front 
& 
Huntingdon 
Building & Loan Assn. v. Berzinski [Front & 
Huntingdon 
Building 
& 
Loan 
Assn. v. Berzinski, 130 Pa Super 297 : 196 
A 572 (Superior Court of Pennsylvania 
1938)] where the words “any of them” were 
held to be the equivalent of “any one of 
them”. 
34. After giving the matter full and 
anxious consideration, we have come to the 
conclusion that the words “any one of the 
Directors” is ambiguous; in some contexts, it 
means “only one of the Directors, does not 

70 
 
matter which one”, but in other contexts, it 
is capable of meaning “every one of the 
Directors”. Which of these two meanings 
was intended by the legislature in any 
particular statutory phrase has to be 
decided by the courts on a consideration of 
the context in which the words appear, and 
in particular, the scheme and object of the 
legislation.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
117. The Constitution Bench in Lala Karam 
Chand 
Thapar 
case [Chief 
Inspector 
of 
Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 
SCR 9 : AIR 1961 SC 838] found that the 
words “any one” have been commonly used to 
mean “every one” i.e. not one, but all. It found 
that the word “any”, in affirmative sentences, 
asserts, concerning a being or thing of the 
sort named, without limitation. It held that it 
is abundantly clear that the words “any one” 
are not infrequently used to mean “every one”. 
 
118. It could be seen that the Constitution 
Bench 
in Lala 
Karam 
Chand 
Thapar 
case [Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam 
Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 : AIR 1961 SC 
838] , after giving the matter full and anxious 
consideration, came to the conclusion that 
the words “any one of the Directors” was an 
ambiguous one. It held that in some contexts, 
it means “only one of the Directors, does not 
matter which one”, but in other contexts, it is 
capable of meaning “every one of the 
Directors”. It held that which of these two 

71 
 
meanings was intended by the legislature in 
any particular statutory phrase has to be 
decided by the courts on consideration of the 
context in which the words appear, and in 
particular, the scheme and object of the 
legislation. 
 
119. After examining the scheme of the Mines 
Act, 1952, the Constitution Bench of this 
Court further observed thus : (Lala Karam 
Chand 
Thapar 
case [Chief 
Inspector 
of 
Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 
SCR 9 : AIR 1961 SC 838] , AIR pp. 848-49, 
paras 36-38) 
“36. But, argues Mr Pathak, one must 
not forget the special rule of interpretation 
for “penal statute” that if the language is 
ambiguous, the interpretation in favour of 
the accused should ordinarily be adopted. 
If you interpret “any one” in the sense 
suggested by him, the legislation he 
suggests is void and so the accused 
escapes. 
One 
of 
the 
two 
possible 
constructions, thus being in favour of the 
accused, should therefore be adopted. In 
our opinion, there is no substance in this 
contention. The rule of strict interpretation 
of penal statutes in favour of the accused is 
not of universal application, and must be 
considered 
along 
with 
other 
well-
established rules of interpretation. We have 
already seen that the scheme and object of 
the statute makes it reasonable to think that 
the legislature intended to subject all the 
Directors of a company owning coal mines 

72 
 
to prosecution and penalties, and not one 
only of the Directors. In the face of these 
considerations there is no scope here of the 
application 
of 
the 
rule 
for 
strict 
interpretation of penal statutes in favour of 
the accused. 
37. The High Court appears to have been 
greatly impressed by the fact that in other 
statutes where the legislature wanted to 
make every one out of a group or a class of 
persons liable it used clear language 
expressing the intention; and that the 
phrase “any one” has not been used in any 
other statute in this country to express 
“every one”. It will be unreasonable, in our 
opinion, to attach too much weight to this 
circumstance; and as for the reasons 
mentioned above, we think the phrase “any 
one of the Directors” is capable of meaning 
“every one of the Directors”, the fact that in 
other statutes, different words were used to 
express a similar meaning is not of any 
significance. 
38. We have, on all these considerations 
come to the conclusion that the words “any 
one of the Directors” has been used in 
Section 76 to mean “every one of the 
Directors”, 
and 
that 
the 
contrary 
interpretation given by the High Court is not 
correct.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
120. It could thus be seen that though it was 
sought to be argued before the Court that 
since the rule of strict interpretation of penal 

73 
 
statutes in favour of the accused has to be 
adopted and that the word “any” was suffixed 
by the word “one”, it has to be given restricted 
meaning; the Court in Lala Karam Chand 
Thapar case [Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala 
Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 : AIR 
1961 SC 838] came to the conclusion that the 
words “any one of the Directors” used in 
Section 76 of the Mines Act, 1952 would mean 
“every one of the Directors”. It is further to be 
noted that the word “any” in the said case was 
suffixed by the word “one”, still the Court held 
that the words “any one” would mean “all” 
and not “one”. It is to be noted that in the 
present case, the legislature has not employed 
the word “one” after the word “any”. It is 
settled law that it has to be construed that 
every single word employed or not employed 
by the legislature has a purpose behind it. 
 
121. On the very date on which the judgment 
in Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam 
Chand 
Thapar [Chief 
Inspector 
of 
Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 
SCR 9 : AIR 1961 SC 838] was pronounced, 
the 
same 
Constitution 
Bench 
also 
pronounced 
the 
judgment 
in Banwarilal 
Agarwalla [Banwarilal Agarwalla v. State of 
Bihar, (1962) 1 SCR 33 : AIR 1961 SC 849] , 
wherein the Constitution Bench observed 
thus : (Banwarilal Agarwalla case [Banwarilal 
Agarwalla v. State of Bihar, (1962) 1 SCR 33 : 
AIR 1961 SC 849] , AIR p. 850, para 3) 
“3. The first contention is based on an 
assumption that the word “any one” in 

74 
 
Section 76 means only “one of the 
Directors, 
and 
only 
one 
of 
the 
shareholders”. This question as regards the 
interpretation of the word “any one” in 
Section 76 was raised in Criminal Appeals 
Nos. 98 to 106 of 1959 (Chief Inspector of 
Mines [Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala 
Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 : AIR 
1961 SC 838] , etc.) and it has been decided 
there that the word “any one” should be 
interpreted there as “every one”. Thus 
under 
Section 
76 
every 
one 
of 
the 
shareholders of a private company owning 
the mine, and every one of the Directors of a 
public company owning the mine is liable to 
prosecution. No question of violation of 
Article 14 therefore arises.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
122. Another Constitution Bench of this 
Court in Tej Kiran Jain [Tej Kiran Jain v. N. 
Sanjiva Reddy, (1970) 2 SCC 272] was 
considering the provisions of Article 105 of 
the Constitution of India and, particularly, 
the immunity as available to the Member of 
Parliament “in respect of anything said … in 
Parliament”. 
The 
Constitution 
Bench 
observed thus : (SCC p. 274, para 8) 
“8. In our judgment it is not possible to 
read the provisions of the article in the way 
suggested. The article means what it says 
in language which could not be plainer. 
The article confers immunity inter alia in 
respect 
of 
“anything 
said 
… 
in 
Parliament”. The word “anything” is of the 

75 
 
widest 
import 
and 
is 
equivalent 
to 
“everything”. The only limitation arises from 
the words “in Parliament” which means 
during the sitting of Parliament and in the 
course of the business of Parliament. We are 
concerned only with speeches in Lok 
Sabha. Once it was proved that Parliament 
was sitting and its business was being 
transacted, anything said during the 
course of that business was immune from 
proceedings in any Court this immunity is 
not only complete but is as it should be. It 
is of the essence of parliamentary system of 
Government that people's representatives 
should be free to express themselves 
without fear of legal consequences. What 
they say is only subject to the discipline of 
the rules of Parliament, the good sense of 
the 
members 
and 
the 
control 
of 
proceedings by the Speaker. The Courts 
have no say in the matter and should really 
have none.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
123. This Court held in Tej Kiran Jain 
case [Tej Kiran Jain v. N. Sanjiva Reddy, 
(1970) 2 SCC 272] that the word “anything” is 
of the widest import and is equivalent to 
“everything”. The only limitation arises from 
the words “in Parliament” which means 
during the sitting of Parliament and in the 
course of the business of Parliament. It held 
that, once it was proved that Parliament was 
sitting and its business was being transacted, 
anything said during the course of that 

76 
 
business was immune from proceedings in 
any court. 
 
124. This Court, in LDA [LDA v. M.K. Gupta, 
(1994) 1 SCC 243] , was considering clause (o) 
of Section 2(1) of the Consumer Protection 
Act, 1986 which defines “service”, wherein the 
word “any” again fell for consideration. This 
Court observed thus : (SCC p. 255, para 4) 
“4. … The words “any” and “potential” 
are significant. Both are of wide amplitude. 
The word “any” dictionarily means “one or 
some or all”. In Black's Law Dictionary it is 
explained thus, ‘word “any” has a diversity 
of meaning and may be employed to 
indicate “all” or “every” as well as “some” or 
“one” and its meaning in a given statute 
depends upon the context and the subject-
matter of the statute’. The use of the word 
“any” in the context it has been used in 
clause (o) indicates that it has been used in 
wider sense extending from one to all.” 
 
125. This 
Court 
held 
in LDA 
case [LDA v. M.K. Gupta, (1994) 1 SCC 243] 
that the word “any” is of wide amplitude. It 
means “one or some or all”. Referring 
to Black's Law Dictionary, the Court observed 
that the word “any” has a diversity of meaning 
and may be employed to indicate “all” or 
“every” as well as “some” or “one”. However, 
the meaning which is to be given to it would 
depend upon the context and the subject-
matter of the statute. 
 

77 
 
126. In K.P. 
Mohammed 
Salim [K.P. 
Mohammed Salim v. CIT, (2008) 11 SCC 573] 
, this Court was considering the power of the 
Director General or Chief Commissioner or 
Commissioner to transfer any case from one 
or more assessing officers subordinate to him 
to any other assessing officer or assessing 
officers. This Court observed thus : (SCC p. 
578, para 17) 
“17. The word “any” must be read in the 
context of the statute and for the said 
purpose, it may in a situation of this 
nature, means all. The principles of 
purposive 
construction 
for 
the 
said 
purpose may be resorted to. (See New India 
Assurance 
Co. 
Ltd. v. Nusli 
Neville 
Wadia [New 
India 
Assurance 
Co. 
Ltd. v. Nusli Neville Wadia, (2008) 3 SCC 
279 : (2008) 1 SCC (Civ) 850] .) Thus, in the 
context of a statute, the word “any” may be 
read as all in the context of the Income Tax 
Act for which the power of transfer has been 
conferred upon the authorities specified 
under Section 127.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
127. The Court in K.P. Mohammed Salim [K.P. 
Mohammed Salim v. CIT, (2008) 11 SCC 573] 
again reiterated that the word “any” must be 
read in the context of the statute. The Court 
also applied the principles of purposive 
construction to the term “any” to mean “all”. 
 
128. In Raj 
Kumar 
Shivhare [Raj 
Kumar 
Shivhare v. Directorate of Enforcement, (2010) 

78 
 
4 SCC 772 : (2010) 3 SCC (Civ) 712] , an 
argument was sought to be advanced that 
since Section 35 of the Foreign Exchange 
Management Act, 1999 uses the words “any 
decision or order”, only appeals from final 
order could be filed. Rejecting the said 
contention, this Court observed thus : (SCC 
pp. 779-80, paras 19-20 & 26) 
“19. The word “any” in this context 
would mean “all”. We are of this opinion in 
view of the fact that this section confers a 
right of appeal on any person aggrieved. A 
right of appeal, it is well settled, is a 
creature of statute. It is never an inherent 
right, like that of filing a suit. A right of 
filing a suit, unless it is barred by statute, 
as it is barred here under Section 34 of 
FEMA, is an inherent right (see Section 9 of 
the Civil Procedure Code) but a right of 
appeal is always conferred by a statute. 
While conferring such right a statute may 
impose restrictions, like limitation or pre-
deposit of penalty or it may limit the area 
of appeal to questions of law or sometime 
to substantial questions of law. Whenever 
such limitations are imposed, they are to 
be strictly followed. But in a case where 
there is no limitation on the nature of order 
or decision to be appealed against, as in 
this case, the right of appeal cannot be 
further curtailed by this Court on the basis 
of an interpretative exercise. 
20. Under Section 35 of FEMA, the 
legislature has conferred a right of appeal 
to a person aggrieved from “any” “order” or 

79 
 
“decision” of the Appellate Tribunal. Of 
course such appeal will have to be on a 
question of law. In this context the word 
“any” would mean “all”. 
*** 
26. In the instant case also when a right 
is conferred on a person aggrieved to file 
appeal from “any” order or decision of the 
Tribunal, there is no reason, in the absence 
of a contrary statutory intent, to give it a 
restricted 
meaning. 
Therefore, 
in 
our 
judgment in Section 35 of FEMA, any 
“order” or “decision” of the Appellate 
Tribunal would mean all decisions or orders 
of the Appellate Tribunal and all such 
decisions or orders are, subject to limitation, 
appealable to the High Court on a question 
of law.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
129. While holding that the word “any” in the 
context would mean “all”, this Court in Raj 
Kumar 
Shivhare [Raj 
Kumar 
Shivhare v. Directorate of Enforcement, (2010) 
4 SCC 772 : (2010) 3 SCC (Civ) 712] observed 
that a right of appeal is always conferred by a 
statute. It has been held that, while conferring 
such right, a statute may impose restrictions, 
like limitation or pre-deposit of penalty or it 
may limit the area of appeal to questions of 
law or sometime to substantial questions of 
law. It has been held that whenever such 
limitations are imposed, they are to be strictly 
followed. It has been held that in a case where 
there is no limitation, the right of appeal 

80 
 
cannot be curtailed by this Court on the basis 
of an interpretative exercise. 
 
130. Shri P. Chidambaram, learned Senior 
Counsel relied on the judgment of this Court 
in Union 
of 
India v. A.B. 
Shah [Union 
of 
India v. A.B. Shah, (1996) 8 SCC 540 : 1996 
SCC (Cri) 688] . In the said case, the High 
Court was considering an appeal preferred by 
the Union of India wherein it had challenged 
the acquittal of the accused by the learned 
trial court, which was confirmed in appeal by 
the High Court. The learned trial court and 
the High Court had held that the complaint 
filed was beyond limitation. This Court 
reversed the judgments of the learned trial 
court and the High Court. 
 
131. This 
Court 
while 
interpreting 
the 
expression “at any time” observed thus : (A.B. 
Shah case [Union of India v. A.B. Shah, (1996) 
8 SCC 540 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 688] , SCC p. 546, 
para 12) 
“12. If we look into Conditions 3 and 6 
with the object and purpose of the Act in 
mind, it has to be held that these 
conditions are not only relatable to what 
was required at the commencement of 
depillaring process, but the unstowing for 
the required length must exist always. The 
expression “at any time” finding place in 
Condition 6 has to mean, in the context in 
which it has been used, “at any point of 
time”, the effect of which is that the required 
length must be maintained all the time. The 

81 
 
accomplishment of object of the Act, one of 
which is safety in the mines, requires 
taking of such a view, especially in the 
backdrop of repeated mine disasters which 
have been taking, off and on, heavy toll of 
lives of the miners. It may be pointed out 
that the word “any” has a diversity of 
meaning and in Black's Law Dictionary it 
has been stated that this word may be 
employed to indicate “all” or “every”, and its 
meaning will depend “upon the context and 
subject-matter of the statute”. A reference to 
what has been stated in Stroud's Judicial 
Dictionary, Vol. I, is revealing inasmuch as 
the import of the word “any” has been 
explained from pp. 145 to 153 of the 4th 
Edn., a perusal of which shows it has 
different connotations depending primarily 
on the subject-matter of the statute and 
the context of its use. A Bench of this Court 
in LDA v. M.K. Gupta [LDA v. M.K. Gupta, 
(1994) 1 SCC 243] , gave a very wide 
meaning to this word finding place in 
Section 2(1)(o) of the Consumer Protection 
Act, 1986 defining “service”. (See para 4)” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
132. Shri Chidambaram rightly argued that 
the word “any” will have to be construed in its 
context, taking into consideration the scheme 
and the purpose of the enactment. There can 
be no quarrel with regard to the said 
proposition. Right from the judgment of the 
Constitution Bench of this Court in Chief 
Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand 

82 
 
Thapar [Chief 
Inspector 
of 
Mines v. Lala 
Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 : AIR 
1961 SC 838] , the position is clear. What is 
the meaning which the legislature intended to 
give to a particular statutory provision has to 
be decided by the Court on a consideration of 
the context in which the word(s) appear(s) and 
in particular, the scheme and object of the 
legislation.” 
 
87. From the perusal of the various judgments, which have 
been referred to in detail by the Constitution Bench, it will be 
clear that the words “all” or “any” will have to be construed in 
their context taking into consideration the scheme and purpose 
of the enactment.  What is the meaning which the legislature 
intended to give to a particular statutory provision has to be 
decided by the Court on a consideration of the context in which 
the word(s) appear(s) and in particular, the scheme and object of 
the legislation. We have no hesitation to hold that the word “all” 
used in clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines, read with the 
legislative policy for which the Electricity Act was enacted and 
read with Section 86(1)(b) of the Electricity Act, will have to be 
construed to be the one including “any”.  As such, the contention 
in that regard is to be rejected.  

83 
 
88. In any case, applying the principle of literal interpretation, 
the evaluation committee/BEC would be entitled to reject only 
such of the price bids if it finds that the rates quoted by the 
bidders are not aligned to the prevailing market prices.  It does 
not stipulate rejection of all the bids in the bidding process.   For 
example, if in a bidding process, which is in accordance with the 
Bidding Guidelines and is transparent, 5 bidders emerged.  Out 
of the said bidders, the rates quoted by only 3 bidders are market 
aligned and the rates quoted by rest of the 2 bidders are not 
market aligned.  In accordance with the Bidding Guidelines, the 
BEC would be entitled to recommend acceptance of the bids of 
the first 3 bidders and reject the bids of rest of the 2 bidders 
whose quoted rates/prices are not found to be market aligned.  
We, therefore, reject the contention in this behalf.  
89. We further find that the Court, while interpreting a 
particular provision, will have to apply the principles of purposive 
construction. The Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of 
Vivek Narayan Sharma (supra) after surveying various 
judgments on the issue has held thus: 

84 
 
“148. It is thus clear that it is a settled 
principle that the modern approach of 
interpretation is a pragmatic one, and not 
pedantic. An interpretation which advances 
the purpose of the Act and which ensures its 
smooth and harmonious working must be 
chosen and the other which leads to 
absurdity, or confusion, or friction, or 
contradiction and conflict between its various 
provisions, or undermines, or tends to defeat 
or destroy the basic scheme and purpose of 
the enactment must be eschewed. The 
primary and foremost task of the Court in 
interpreting a statute is to gather the 
intention of the legislature, actual or imputed. 
Having ascertained the intention, it is the 
duty of the Court to strive to so interpret the 
statute as to promote or advance the object 
and purpose of the enactment. For this 
purpose, where necessary, the Court may 
even depart from the rule that plain words 
should be interpreted according to their plain 
meaning. There need be no meek and mute 
submission to the plainness of the language. 
To avoid patent injustice, anomaly or 
absurdity or to avoid invalidation of a law, the 
court would be justified in departing from the 
so-called golden rule of construction so as to 
give effect to the object and purpose of the 
enactment. Ascertainment of legislative intent 
is the basic rule of statutory construction.” 
 
 
90. It could thus be seen that it is a settled principle that the 
modern approach of interpretation is a pragmatic one, and not 

85 
 
pedantic. An interpretation which advances the purpose of the 
Act and which ensures its smooth and harmonious working must 
be chosen and the other which leads to absurdity, or confusion, 
or friction, or contradiction and conflict between its various 
provisions, or undermines, or tends to defeat or destroy the basic 
scheme and purpose of the enactment must be eschewed.  
91. If the contention that clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines 
will come into play, which permits the Evaluation Committee to 
reject “all” price bids and not “any” one of them is accepted, it 
will lead to nothing else than resulting in absurdity.  Suppose, if 
L-1 bidder quotes Rs.3 per unit and L-5 bidder quotes Rs.7 per 
unit, requirement to reject the bid of L-1 bidder, whose bid is 
found market aligned along with that of L-5 bidder, which is not 
market aligned, would lead to an anomalous situation. Could the 
consumer be deprived of the electricity to be procured from L-1 
at a market aligned price only because some of the bidders have 
quoted much higher prices and are not market aligned.  In our 
view, such an interpretation would result in defeating one of the 
main objects of the enactment, i.e., protection of the consumer.  

86 
 
92. It is needless to state that this Court, time and again, in 
various judgments including the one in the case of GMR Warora 
Energy Limited (supra) has recognised the requirement of 
balancing the consumers’ interest with that of the interest of the 
generators. It will not be permissible to take a lopsided view only 
to protect the interest of the generators ignoring the consumers’ 
interest and public interest.  
93. We find that the High Court was not justified in entertaining 
the petition. The Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of 
PTC India Limited (supra) has held that the Electricity Act is an 
exhaustive code on all matters concerning electricity.  Under the 
Electricity Act, all issues dealing with electricity have to be 
considered by the authorities constituted under the said Act.  As 
held by the Constitution Bench of this Court, the State Electricity 
Commission and the learned APTEL have ample powers to 
adjudicate in the matters with regard to electricity.  Not only that, 
these Tribunals are tribunals consisting of experts having vast 
experience in the field of electricity. As such, we find that the 
High Court erred in directly entertaining the writ petition when 
the respondent No.1, i.e., the writ petitioner before the High 

87 
 
Court had an adequate alternate remedy of approaching the 
State Electricity Commission.   
94. This Court in the case of Reliance Infrastructure Limited 
v. State of Maharashtra and others11 has held that while 
exercising its power of judicial review, the Court can step in 
where a case of manifest unreasonableness or arbitrariness is 
made out.   
95. In the present case, there is not even an allegation with 
regard to that effect. In such circumstances, recourse to a 
petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in the 
availability of efficacious alternate remedy under a statute, which 
is a complete code in itself, in our view, was not justified.   
96. No doubt that availability of an alternate remedy is not a 
complete bar in the exercise of the power of judicial review by the 
High Courts.  But, recourse to such a remedy would be 
permissible only if extraordinary and exceptional circumstances 
are made out.   A reference in this respect could be made to the 
judgments of this Court in the cases of Radha Krishan 
 
11 (2019) 3 SCC 352=2019 INSC 63 

88 
 
Industries v. State of Himachal Pradesh and others12 and 
South Indian Bank Ltd. and others v. Naveen Mathew Philip 
and another13. 
97. We may gainfully refer to the observation of this Court in 
the case of Radha Krishan Industries (supra), wherein this 
Court has laid down certain principles after referring to the 
earlier judgments: 
“24. The High Court has dealt with the 
maintainability of the petition under Article 
226 of the Constitution. Relying on the 
decision of this Court in CCT v. Glaxo Smith 
Kline 
Consumer 
Health 
Care 
Ltd. [CCT v. Glaxo 
Smith 
Kline 
Consumer 
Health Care Ltd., (2020) 19 SCC 681 : 2020 
SCC OnLine SC 440] , the High Court noted 
that although it can entertain a petition under 
Article 226 of the Constitution, it must not do 
so when the aggrieved person has an effective 
alternate remedy available in law. However, 
certain exceptions to this “rule of alternate 
remedy” 
include 
where, 
the 
statutory 
authority has not acted in accordance with 
the provisions of the law or acted in defiance 
of the fundamental principles of judicial 
procedure; 
or 
has 
resorted 
to 
invoke 
provisions, which are repealed; or where an 
order has been passed in violation of the 
 
12 (2021) 6 SCC 771=2021 INSC 266 
13 2023 SCC OnLine SC 435 =2023 INSC 379 

89 
 
principles of natural justice. Applying this 
formulation, the High Court noted that the 
appellant has an alternate remedy available 
under the GST Act and thus, the petition was 
not maintainable. 
 
25. In this background, it becomes necessary 
for this Court, to dwell on the “rule of 
alternate remedy” and its judicial exposition. 
In Whirlpool 
Corpn. v. Registrar 
of 
Trade 
Marks [Whirlpool Corpn. v. Registrar of Trade 
Marks, (1998) 8 SCC 1] , a two-Judge Bench 
of this Court after reviewing the case law on 
this point, noted : (SCC pp. 9-10, paras 14-
15) 
“14. The power to issue prerogative writs 
under Article 226 of the Constitution is 
plenary in nature and is not limited by any 
other provision of the Constitution. This 
power can be exercised by the High Court 
not only for issuing writs in the nature of 
habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, 
quo warranto and certiorari for the 
enforcement of any of the Fundamental 
Rights contained in Part III of the 
Constitution but also for “any other 
purpose”. 
15. Under 
Article 
226 
of 
the 
Constitution, the High Court, having 
regard to the facts of the case, has a 
discretion to entertain or not to entertain a 
writ petition. But the High Court has 
imposed upon itself certain restrictions one 
of which is that if an effective and 
efficacious remedy is available, the High 

90 
 
Court would not normally exercise its 
jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has 
been consistently held by this Court not to 
operate as a bar in at least three 
contingencies, namely, where the writ 
petition has been filed for the enforcement of 
any of the Fundamental Rights or where 
there has been a violation of the principle of 
natural justice or where the order or 
proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction 
or the vires of an Act is challenged. There is 
a plethora of case-law on this point but to 
cut down this circle of forensic whirlpool, 
we would rely on some old decisions of the 
evolutionary era of the constitutional law 
as they still hold the field.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
26. Following the dictum of this Court 
in Whirlpool [Whirlpool Corpn. v. Registrar of 
Trade Marks, (1998) 8 SCC 1] , in Harbanslal 
Sahnia v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. [Harbanslal 
Sahnia v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd., (2003) 2 SCC 
107] , this Court noted that : (Harbanslal 
Sahnia case [Harbanslal Sahnia v. Indian Oil 
Corpn. Ltd., (2003) 2 SCC 107] , SCC p. 110, 
para 7) 
“7. So far as the view taken by the High 
Court that the remedy by way of recourse 
to arbitration clause was available to the 
appellants and therefore the writ petition 
filed by the appellants was liable to be 
dismissed is concerned, suffice it to 
observe that the rule of exclusion of writ 
jurisdiction by availability of an alternative 

91 
 
remedy is a rule of discretion and not one 
of compulsion. In an appropriate case, in 
spite of availability of the alternative 
remedy, the High Court may still exercise its 
writ 
jurisdiction 
in 
at 
least 
three 
contingencies : (i) where the writ petition 
seeks 
enforcement 
of 
any 
of 
the 
fundamental rights; (ii) where there is 
failure of principles of natural justice; or (iii) 
where the orders or proceedings are wholly 
without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is 
challenged. 
(See Whirlpool 
Corpn.v. Registrar 
of 
Trade 
Marks [Whirlpool 
Corpn. v. Registrar 
of 
Trade Marks, (1998) 8 SCC 1] .) The present 
case attracts applicability of the first two 
contingencies. Moreover, as noted, the 
appellants' dealership, which is their bread 
and butter, came to be terminated for an 
irrelevant and non-existent cause. In such 
circumstances, we feel that the appellants 
should have been allowed relief by the High 
Court itself instead of driving them to the 
need of initiating arbitration proceedings.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
27. The principles of law which emerge are 
that: 
 
27.1. The power under Article 226 of the 
Constitution to issue writs can be exercised 
not only for the enforcement of fundamental 
rights, but for any other purpose as well. 
 

92 
 
27.2. The High Court has the discretion not 
to entertain a writ petition. One of the 
restrictions placed on the power of the High 
Court is where an effective alternate remedy 
is available to the aggrieved person. 
 
27.3. Exceptions to the rule of alternate 
remedy arise where : (a) the writ petition has 
been 
filed 
for 
the 
enforcement 
of 
a 
fundamental right protected by Part III of the 
Constitution; (b) there has been a violation of 
the principles of natural justice; (c) the order 
or 
proceedings 
are 
wholly 
without 
jurisdiction; or (d) the vires of a legislation is 
challenged. 
 
27.4. An alternate remedy by itself does not 
divest the High Court of its powers under 
Article 226 of the Constitution in an 
appropriate case though ordinarily, a writ 
petition should not be entertained when an 
efficacious alternate remedy is provided by 
law. 
 
27.5. When a right is created by a statute, 
which 
itself 
prescribes 
the 
remedy 
or 
procedure for enforcing the right or liability, 
resort must be had to that particular 
statutory 
remedy 
before 
invoking 
the 
discretionary remedy under Article 226 of the 
Constitution. This rule of exhaustion of 
statutory remedies is a rule of policy, 
convenience and discretion. 
 

93 
 
27.6. In cases where there are disputed 
questions of fact, the High Court may decide 
to decline jurisdiction in a writ petition. 
However, if the High Court is objectively of the 
view that the nature of the controversy 
requires the exercise of its writ jurisdiction, 
such a view would not readily be interfered 
with. 
 
28. These principles have been consistently 
upheld 
by 
this 
Court 
in Chand 
Ratan v. Durga 
Prasad [Chand 
Ratan v. Durga Prasad, (2003) 5 SCC 399] 
, Babubhai 
Muljibhai 
Patel v. Nandlal 
Khodidas 
Barot [Babubhai 
Muljibhai 
Patel v. Nandlal Khodidas Barot, (1974) 2 SCC 
706] 
and Rajasthan 
SEB v. Union 
of 
India [Rajasthan SEB v. Union of India, (2008) 
5 SCC 632] among other decisions.” 
 
98. This Court has clearly held that when a right is created by 
a statute, which itself prescribes the remedy or procedure for 
enforcing the right or liability, resort must be had to that 
particular statutory remedy before invoking the discretionary 
remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.  
99. Recently, this Court in the case of M/s South Indian Bank 
Ltd. & Ors. (supra) has also taken a similar view.     

94 
 
100. There is another ground on which the High Court ought to 
have refused to entertain the petition. The bid of L-7 bidder was 
returned and the Bid Bond bank guarantee was also directed not 
to be extended vide the communication dated 6th January 2015.  
The judgment and order passed by this Court, on which reliance 
is placed by respondent No.1, is also delivered on 25th April 2018.  
However, the respondent No.1 did not take any steps from 6th 
January 2015 and in any case, from 25th April 2018 till 14th 
December 2020, on which date the petition came to be filed 
before the High Court.  No doubt that the petition need not be 
dismissed solely on the ground of delay and laches.  However, if 
petitioner approaches the Court with delay, he has to satisfy the 
Court about the justification for delay in approaching the Court 
belatedly.  In our considered view, the High Court ought not to 
have entertained the petition also on the ground of delay and 
laches.   
101. In any case, we find that the High Court was not justified in 
issuing the mandamus in the nature which it has issued.  This 

95 
 
Court in the case of Air India Ltd. v. Cochin International 
Airport Ltd. and others14 has observed thus: 
“7. The law relating to award of a contract by the 
State, its corporations and bodies acting as 
instrumentalities 
and 
agencies 
of 
the 
Government has been settled by the decision of 
this 
Court 
in Ramana 
Dayaram 
Shetty v. International 
Airport 
Authority 
of 
India [(1979) 3 SCC 489] , Fertilizer Corpn. 
Kamgar Union (Regd.) v. Union of India [(1981) 1 
SCC 568] , CCE v. Dunlop India Ltd. [(1985) 1 
SCC 260 : 1985 SCC (Tax) 75] , Tata 
Cellular v. Union of India [(1994) 6 SCC 651] 
, Ramniklal 
N. 
Bhutta v. State 
of 
Maharashtra [(1997) 1 SCC 134] and Raunaq 
International 
Ltd. v. I.V.R. 
Construction 
Ltd. [(1999) 1 SCC 492] The award of a contract, 
whether it is by a private party or by a public 
body or the State, is essentially a commercial 
transaction. In arriving at a commercial decision 
considerations 
which 
are 
paramount 
are 
commercial considerations. The State can 
choose its own method to arrive at a decision. It 
can fix its own terms of invitation to tender and 
that is not open to judicial scrutiny. It can enter 
into negotiations before finally deciding to accept 
one of the offers made to it. Price need not always 
be the sole criterion for awarding a contract. It 
is free to grant any relaxation, for bona fide 
reasons, if the tender conditions permit such a 
relaxation. It may not accept the offer even 
though it happens to be the highest or the 
lowest. 
But 
the 
State, 
its 
corporations, 
instrumentalities and agencies are bound to 
adhere to the norms, standards and procedures 
 
14 (2000) 2 SCC 617=2000 INSC 39  

96 
 
laid down by them and cannot depart from them 
arbitrarily. 
Though 
that 
decision 
is 
not 
amenable to judicial review, the court can 
examine the decision-making process and 
interfere if it is found vitiated by mala fides, 
unreasonableness and arbitrariness. The State, 
its corporations, instrumentalities and agencies 
have the public duty to be fair to all concerned. 
Even when some defect is found in the decision-
making process the court must exercise its 
discretionary power under Article 226 with great 
caution 
and 
should 
exercise 
it 
only 
in 
furtherance of public interest and not merely on 
the making out of a legal point. The court should 
always keep the larger public interest in mind in 
order to decide whether its intervention is called 
for or not. Only when it comes to a conclusion 
that overwhelming public interest requires 
interference, the court should intervene.” 
 
102. It could thus be seen that this Court has held that the 
award of a contract, whether it is by a private party or by a public 
body or the State, is essentially a commercial transaction. In 
arriving at a commercial decision, considerations which are 
paramount are commercial considerations.  It has been held that 
the State can choose its own method to arrive at a decision. It 
can fix its own terms of invitation to tender and that is not open 
to judicial scrutiny. It has further been held that the State can 
enter into negotiations before finally deciding to accept one of the 
offers made to it.  It has further been held that, price need not 

97 
 
always be the sole criterion for awarding a contract.   It has been 
held that the State may not accept the offer even though it 
happens to be the highest or the lowest. However, the State, its 
corporations, instrumentalities and agencies are bound to adhere 
to the norms, standards and procedures laid down by them and 
cannot depart from them arbitrarily. Though that decision is not 
amenable to judicial review, the court can examine the decision-
making process and interfere if it is found vitiated by mala fides, 
unreasonableness and arbitrariness.  It has further been held 
that even when some defect has been found in the decision-
making process, the court must exercise its discretionary power 
under Article 226 with great caution and should exercise it only 
in furtherance of public interest and not merely on the making 
out of a legal point. The court should always keep the larger 
public interest in mind in order to decide whether its intervention 
is called for or not. Only when it comes to a conclusion that 
overwhelming public interest requires interference, the court 
should intervene. 
103. As has been held by this Court in the case of Tata Cellular 
(supra), the Court is not only concerned with the merits of the 

98 
 
decision but also with the decision-making process. Unless the 
Court finds that the decision-making process is vitiated by 
arbitrariness, mala fides, irrationality, it will not be permissible 
for the Court to interfere with the same.  
104. In the present case, the decision-making process, as 
adopted by the BEC was totally in conformity with the principles 
laid down by this Court from time to time. The BEC after 
considering the competitive rates offered in the bidding process 
in various States came to a conclusion that the rates quoted by 
SKS Power (L-5 bidder) were not market aligned.  The said 
decision has been approved by the State Commission.  Since the 
decision-making process adopted by the BEC, which has been 
approved by the State Commission, was in accordance with the 
law laid down by this Court, the same ought not to have been 
interfered with by the learned APTEL.    
105. In any case, the High Court, by the impugned judgment and 
order, 
could 
not 
have 
issued 
a 
mandamus 
to 
the 
instrumentalities of the State to enter into a contract, which was 
totally harmful to the public interest.  Inasmuch as, if the 
power/electricity is to be procured by the procurers at the rates 

99 
 
quoted by the respondent No.1-MB Power, which is even higher 
than the rates quoted by the SKS Power (L-5 bidder), then the 
State would have been required to bear financial burden in 
thousands of crore rupees, which would have, in turn, passed on 
to the consumers.  As such, we are of the considered view that 
the mandamus issued by the Court is issued by failing to take 
into consideration the larger consumers’ interest and the 
consequential public interest.  We are, therefore, of the view that 
the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is 
not sustainable in law and deserves to be quashed and set aside.   
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 6503 OF 2022 AND CIVIL APPEAL NO. 
6502 OF 2022 
 
106. The appeals are, therefore, allowed.  The impugned 
judgment and order of the Division Bench of the High Court of 
Judicature for Rajasthan, Bench at Jaipur dated 20th September 
2021 in D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 14815 of 2020 is quashed 
and set aside.  The respondent No.1-M.B. Power (Madhya 
Pradesh) Limited is directed to pay costs, quantified at 
Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakh) in each case to the appellants.  
107. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of. 

100 
 
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4612 OF 2023 
 
108. Since we have already set aside the judgment and order of 
the High Court dated 20th September 2021 in D.B. Civil Writ 
Petition No.14815 of 2020 and the order impugned in the present 
appeal is based on the said order of the High Court dated 20th 
September 2021, the present appeal is also allowed.  The 
judgment and order of the learned APTEL dated 1st June 2023 is 
quashed and set aside.  
109. Since we have saddled the costs in Civil Appeal Nos. 6503 
of 2022 and 6502 of 2022, there shall be no order as to costs in 
the present appeal.  
110. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
