Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“IPC”) against Respondent Nos.             
2 to 4 (the “Accused Persons”) alleging inter alia that (i) the 
Appellant and Respondent No. 5 were beaten-up and 
accordingly, injured by Accused Persons who were wielding 
guns, rifles, revolvers and pistols; and (ii) Respondent No. 5 was 
further abducted by the Accused Persons (the “FIR”). 
4. 
The matter was investigated by the police and thereafter a 
charge-sheet was filed against the Accused Persons qua offences 
under Sections 147, 148, 149, 323 and 364 of the IPC (the 
“Chargesheet”). Pursuant to the filing of the Chargesheet, Ld. 
Civil Judge, Junior Division, Tirwa, District, proceeded to take 
cognizance of the offences and inter alia issued process to the 
Accused Persons; and rejected objections filed by the Accused 
Persons vide order(s) dated (a) 29.11.1999; and (b) 18.04.2000 in 
Criminal Cases No. 1265 of 1999 and 1264 of 1999 (the 
“Summoning Order”). 
5. 
Aggrieved, the Accused Persons preferred (i) a criminal 
revision petition assailing inter alia the Summoning Order (the 
“Revision Petition”); and (ii) an application under Section 482 
CrPC seeking the quashing of the Chargesheet before the High 
Court (the “Quashing Petition”). Pertinently, vide an order dated 
28.05.2010, the High Court dismissed both (i) the Revision 
Petition; and (ii) the Quashing Petition (the “1st HC Order”).

6. 
Thereafter, the Appellant preferred an application before 
the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Farrukhabad (the “Trial Court”) 
for issuance of non-bailable warrants (“NBWs”) against Accused 
Persons. Vide an order dated 17.01.2020, the Trial Court ordered 
the issuance of non-bailable warrants.  On 28.09.2022, during the 
pendency of the trial before the Trial Court, the Accused Persons 
brought a settlement agreement dated 28.09.2022 executed inter 
alios the Accused Person(s) and Respondent No. 5 (the 
“Settlement Agreement”) to the notice of the Trial Court. 
Accordingly, an application was preferred by the Accused 
Persons under Section 482 CrPC before the High Court seeking 
quashing of the proceedings emanating from the FIR on the basis 
of the Settlement Agreement (the “1st Settlement Application”). 
However, vide an order dated 23.12.2022 in the 1st Settlement 
Application, the High Court directed the Trial Court to consider 
the Settlement Agreement; and pass appropriate order(s) within a 
period of 1 (one) month (the “2nd HC Order”).   
7. 
Pursuant to the 2nd HC Order, Trial Court considered the 
Settlement Agreement; and vide an order dated 23.01.2023, the 
Trial Court observed inter alia that (i) the Chargesheet has been 
filed under Sections 147, 148, 149, 323 and 364 of the IPC of 
which Section(s) 147, 148, 149, 364 are non-compoundable in 
nature; (ii) the FIR was lodged by the Appellant herein who was 
an injured person, yet wasn’t made a party to the Settlement 

SLP(Crl.) No. 16426 of 2023 
 
Page 4 of 10 
 
Agreement; and (iii) that the Appellant had filed an objection to 
the Settlement Agreement. Accordingly, in view of the aforesaid 
the Trial Court rejected the Settlement Agreement (the 
“Underlying Order”). 
8. 
Aggrieved by Underlying Order, another application was 
preferred by the Accused Persons before the High Court under 
Section 482 of the CrPC seeking the quashing of (i) the FIR; and 
(ii) the proceeding(s) emanating from the FIR on the basis of the 
Settlement Agreement (the “2nd Settlement Application”). The 
High Court vide the Impugned Order allowed the 2nd Settlement 
Application. The operative paragraph(s) of the Impugned Order 
are reproduced as under:  
“On behalf of the applicant, this application 
is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing of 
Case No. 1288 of 2003, Case Crime No. 966 of 1999 
under Section 364, 147, 148, 149, 323 I.P.C., Police 
Station 
Kotwali 
Farrukhabad: 
District 
Farrukhabad which is under consideration of court 
of Learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Farrukhabad 
on the ground that the entire proceeding should be 
cancelled on the basis of the agreement dated 28-
09-2022 between the parties. 
 
Learned Counsel for the applicants and 
opposite party No. 3 states that a settlement 
agreement has been reached between the parties on 
date 28-09-2022 in which it is mentioned that a 
First Information Report was lodged by the 

SLP(Crl.) No. 16426 of 2023 
 
Page 5 of 10 
 
complainant against unknown people.  The 
complainant has not taken the name of any accused 
in his statement under Section 161 and 164 Cr.P.C.  
It has also been mentioned in the said agreement 
that the mutual relations between the two parties 
have become quite cordial and there is no dispute of 
any kind left between them.  The attested copy of the 
said agreement has been attached to this 
application as Annexure 4.  
 
Learned counsel for the applicants and Mr. 
Md. Nadeem, learned counsel for opposite party 
number 3, have stated that they want disposal of the 
present case and do not want to pursue this issue 
further, hence the entire subsequent proceedings 
should be set aside.  In support of his argument he 
cited the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in 
Narinder Singh & Ors. Vs. State of Punjab & Anr. 
2014 Law Suit (SC) 202, Yogendra Yadav & Ors. 
Vs. State of Jharkhand & Anr., Dimpey Gujral 
W/o Vivek Gujral & Ors. Vs. Union Territory & 
Ors. and drawn the attention of the Court towards 
the said judgments.  
 
Hearing the learned counsel for the parties 
and the learned Additional Government Advocate 
and examining the file and after considering the 
above precedents of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, 
this application submitted under Section 482 CrPC 
is eligible to be accepted.  
 
Accordingly, this application is accepted and 
the entire proceedings of the above mentioned case 
are set aside.”

9. 
The Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant 
has submitted that the Appellant is an injured victim of the 
alleged offence; and also, is the original complainant in relation 
to the FIR. Accordingly, it has been vehemently contended before 
us that the High Court erred in law as well as in facts by allowing 
the 2nd Settlement Application. It was also submitted before us 
that the Impugned Order suffers from perversity and illegality on 
account of the fact that it fails to consider that the Appellant i.e., 
the original complainant, was neither a party to the Settlement 
Agreement nor was amenable to such a course of action. In this 
context, it was submitted that the High Court ought not to have 
exercised its jurisdiction under 482 CrPC in favour of the 
Accused Persons. 
10. 
On the other hand, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf 
of Accused Persons has submitted that the Accused Persons 
entered into a settlement / compromise with Respondent No. 5 
i.e., the principal victim who was allegedly abducted, and 
accordingly, once Respondent No. 5 had settled the matter, there 
was no justifiable cause to continue criminal proceedings against 
the Accused Persons.  Thus, it was submitted that the Impugned 
Order, was a well-reasoned order, that warrants no interference 
from this Court.

11. 
We have heard the counsel(s) appearing on behalf of the 
parties and perused the record. Admittedly and undisputedly, the 
Appellant herein is (i) an injured victim qua the alleged offence; 
and (ii) the original complainant qua the FIR. Furthermore, from 
the materials placed on record and the arguments advanced, it can 
safely be concluded that the Appellant neither entered into any 
settlement with the Accused Persons nor was courting any such 
idea. Accordingly, in view of the aforesaid circumstances, we fail 
to understand how the High Court proceeded to quash the FIR; 
and the proceedings emanating thereof in exercise of its 
jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC. This Court in Gian Singh 
v. State of Punjab, (2012) 10 SCC 303 authoritatively laid down 
principles governing the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 
482 CrPC by High Courts vis-à-vis quashing of an FIR, criminal 
proceeding or complaint. The same is reproduced as under:  
“61. The position that emerges from the above 
discussion can be summarised thus : the power of 
the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding 
or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent 
jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power 
given to a criminal court for compounding the 
offences under Section 320 of the Code. Inherent 
power is of wide plenitude with no statutory 
limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with 
the guideline engrafted in such power viz. : (i) to 
secure the ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of 
the process of any court. In what cases power to 

SLP(Crl.) No. 16426 of 2023 
 
Page 8 of 10 
 
quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR 
may be exercised where the offender and the victim 
have settled their dispute would depend on the facts 
and circumstances of each case and no category can 
be prescribed. However, before exercise of such 
power, the High Court must have due regard to the 
nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and 
serious offences of mental depravity or offences like 
murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly 
quashed even though the victim or victim's family 
and the offender have settled the dispute. Such 
offences are not private in nature and have a serious 
impact on society. Similarly, any compromise 
between the victim and the offender in relation to 
the offences under special statutes like the 
Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences 
committed by public servants while working in that 
capacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis for 
quashing criminal proceedings involving such 
offences. 
But 
the 
criminal 
cases 
having 
overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour 
stand on a different footing for the purposes of 
quashing, particularly the offences arising from 
commercial, 
financial, 
mercantile, 
civil, 
partnership or such like transactions or the offences 
arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or 
the family disputes where the wrong is basically 
private or personal in nature and the parties have 
resolved their entire dispute. In this category of 
cases, the High Court may quash the criminal 
proceedings if in its view, because of the 
compromise between the offender and the victim, 
the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and 

SLP(Crl.) No. 16426 of 2023 
 
Page 9 of 10 
 
continuation of the criminal case would put the 
accused to great oppression and prejudice and 
extreme injustice would be caused to him by not 
quashing the criminal case despite full and 
complete settlement and compromise with the 
victim. In other words, the High Court must 
consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to 
the interest of justice to continue with the criminal 
proceeding or continuation of the criminal 
proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of 
law despite settlement and compromise between the 
victim and the wrongdoer and whether to secure the 
ends of justice, it is appropriate that the criminal 
case is put to an end and if the answer to the above 
question(s) is in the affirmative, the High Court 
shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the 
criminal proceeding.” 
12.  Thus, it is our considered opinion that the High Court has 
certainly erred by quashing (i) the FIR; and (ii) the criminal 
proceeding(s) emanating from the FIR on the basis of the 
Settlement Agreement. The High Court failed to notice that the 
Appellant i.e., an injured victim; and original complainant was 
not a party to the Settlement Agreement and nor was agreeable to 
such a course of action. Accordingly, we find that Impugned 
Order neither secured the ends of justice nor prevented an abuse 
of process of law, thus we find that the Impugned Order was 
erroneous and contrary to principles laid down in Gian Singh 
(Supra).

13. 
With the aforesaid observations, the appeal is accordingly 
allowed, and the Impugned Order is set aside. The proceedings 
emanating from FIR i.e., Case No. 1288 of 2003, stand restored 
to the file of the Trial Court, with a direction to the Trial Court to 
dispose of the same expeditiously, preferably, within a period of 
one year, in view of the fact that the FIR pertains to the year 1999. 
14. 
Pending application(s), if any, are disposed of.
