PRAMILA                                            APPELLANT(S)
                             VERSUS
STATE OF CHHATTISGARH                              RESPONDENT(S)
J U D G M E N T
ABHAY S. OKA, J.
Heard the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant
and the learned counsel for the respondent/State.
The appellant has taken an exception to the judgment and order
dated 3rd May, 2010 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court
of Chhattisgarh.  The appellant herein was the second appellant
before  the  High  Court.   The  appellant  was  convicted  for  the
offences punishable under Sections 302 and 201 read with Section 34
of  the  Indian  Penal  Code,  1860  and  sentenced  to  undergo  life
imprisonment.
The issue of juvenility was raised by the appellant in this
Appeal  during  the  course  of  hearing  by  filing  an  interlocutory
application.  Therefore, vide order dated 13th September, 2023, this
Court  directed  the  Sessions  Court  to  hold  an  enquiry  into  that
aspect  of  issue  of  juvenility.   In  terms  of  the  order  of  this
Court,  the  learned  1st Additional  Sessions  Judge,  Ramanujganj,
District Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, has submitted a finding dated 30th
October,  2023,  which  records  that  the  date  of  birth  of  the

appellant is 1st September, 1982 and, therefore, on 15th June, 2000,
which is the date of the occurrence of the offence, the age of the
appellant was 17 years, 09 months and 14 days.  The statements of
the witnesses as well as the documents produced on record during
the inquiry have been forwarded to this Court.
A perusal of the report shows that apart from other documents,
reliance  has  been  placed  on  the  entries  in  the  school  leaving
register  of  the  school  last  attended  by  the  appellant.   This
document is of the year 1988.  The name of the appellant appears at
serial no.369 and her date of birth shown therein is 1st September,
1982.   Even  the  primary  certificate  examination  result-sheet  of
1995 shows the same date of birth.
Therefore, we have to proceed on the footing that on the date
on which the incident constituting the offence took place, the age
of the appellant was less than 18 years.  The Juvenile Justice
(Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (for short, “the 2000
JJ Act”) was admittedly not in force when the incident occurred.
Therefore, the case will be governed by the Juvenile Justice Act,
1986 (for short, “the 1986 JJ Act”).  Under clause (h) of Section 2
of the 1986 JJ Act, a ‘juvenile’ has been defined to mean a boy who
has not attained the age of sixteen years or a girl who has not
attained  the  age  of  eighteen  years.   Thus,  on  the  date  of
occurrence of the offence, the appellant was a juvenile. Therefore,
the  appellant  ought  to  have  been  dealt  with  in  accordance  with
Section 21 of the 1986 JJ Act.  The maximum action which could have
been taken against the appellant was of sending her to a special
home.  In the case of a girl of sixteen years of age, she could
2

have been sent to a special home for a period of not less than
three years.  As per Section 22(1) of the 1986 JJ Act, there was a
prohibition  on  sentencing  a  juvenile  to  undergo  imprisonment.
There is a similar provision under Section 16 of the 2000 JJ Act.
In  the  present  case,  as  can  be  seen  from  the  order  dated
6th January, 2012, the appellant had undergone incarceration for a
period of more than eight years.
Hence,  the  present  Appeal  must  succeed  and  the  impugned
judgment and order dated 3rd May, 2010 passed by the High Court and
the impugned judgment and order dated 30th June, 2003 passed by the
Additional  Sessions  Judge,  Ramanujganj,  District  Sarguja,
Chhattisgarh, are hereby quashed and set aside only insofar as the
appellant (accused no.2) is concerned.
As the appellant has undergone incarceration for a period of
more than eight years, no purpose will be served by sending the
appellant before the Juvenile Justice Board.
The bail bonds of the appellant stand cancelled.
The Appeal is, accordingly, allowed.
