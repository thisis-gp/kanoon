1.  
These appeals arise from the judgment dated 17th August, 
2012 rendered by the Division Bench of High Court of Punjab and 
Haryana whereby, the intra-court appeals1 preferred by the 
appellants herein were dismissed and the judgment dated 11th 
August, 2011 passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court 
was upheld. The Learned Single Judge rejected the Civil Writ 
Petitions2 preferred by the appellants for grant of benefits under 
the Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988 and Assured Career

Progression Scheme, 1998, by accounting for their entire service 
period including that in the work charged establishment.  
2.  
Shri P.S. Patwalia, learned senior counsel appearing on 
behalf of the appellants, vehemently and fervently contended that 
the Government of Punjab has on its own volition, extended the 
very same benefits of Proficiency Step-up to other employees 
situated at par with the appellants, and thus, the differential 
treatment meted out to the appellants tantamount to hostile and 
subjective discrimination, which is violative of Article 14 of the 
Constitution of India. In this regard, learned senior counsel drew 
the attention of this Court to the Policy Circular dated 13th March, 
1996, issued by the Department of Irrigation and Power (Irrigation 
Personnel-III), Government of Punjab, whereby, it was decided that 
the Government Policy contained in the letter dated 7th May, 1993 
would be relaxed and the services of the work-charged staff of 
Ranjit Sagar Dam would be regularised. He submitted that clause 
(a) of the said Policy Circular clearly provided that the past services 
rendered by the employees on work charged/daily basis will be 
treated as qualifying service for pensionary and all other 
consequential benefits.

3.  
Learned 
senior 
counsel 
further 
referred 
to 
various 
communications and circulars, more specifically to the Circular 
dated 12th April, 2005 issued by the Chief Engineer, Irrigation 
Department, Punjab, whereby, it was communicated as below: - 
“All the aforementioned judgements which have been allowed 
by the Hon’ble Courts in favour of the petitioners were filed by 
various categories of employees for counting of their work 
charge service rendered prior to regularisation of their services 
for granting 8/18 years of proficiency step-up(s). 
In this regard this be informed that how many similar 
employees of different categories had left who are entitled 
for the grant of proficiency step up(s) for 8/18 years after 
counting their work charge service rendered prior to their 
regularisation. After clarifying the position, the complete 
report be sent to this office within 15 days. In addition to 
aforesaid, this be also conveyed that by doing so from which 
date the official will be entitled for the grant of 8 and 18 years 
of proficiency step-up(s) and how much financial burden will 
have to be bore by the government. You will solely be liable for 
not sending the complete report as required aforesaid within 
the stipulated time.” 
 
4.  
Learned senior counsel for the appellants, thus, submitted 
that the appellants herein are entitled to reliefs sought for in these 
appeals by reversing/modifying the judgment rendered by the 
learned Single Judge of the High Court as upheld by the learned 
Division Bench.  
5.  
During the course of submissions, Shri P.S. Patwalia had 
restricted the claims of the appellants to the benefits under the 
Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988.

6.  
Per contra, Shri Shadan Farasat, learned AAG representing 
the State, vehemently and fervently contested the submissions 
advanced by the counsel for the appellants and urged that the 
benefits under the Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988 to employees 
situated at par with the appellants herein were extended only in 
the cases where such employees were granted the said relief in 
compliance of the orders passed by the courts in judicial 
proceedings. Nonetheless, Shri Farasat was not in a position to 
dispute the fact that the Circular dated 12th April, 2005 issued by 
the Chief Engineer, Irrigation Department, Punjab, clearly 
provides for the grant of Proficiency Step-up(s) to employees of 
different categories who were left out after the various judgments 
of the courts, without any court orders being in force qua such 
employees.  
7.  
We have given our thoughtful consideration to the 
submissions advanced at the bar and have perused the impugned 
judgments. With the assistance of learned counsel for the parties, 
we have thoroughly examined the material available on record.  
8.  
The primary issue that arises for consideration before this 
Court is whether the service rendered by the appellants herein as 
work charge employees prior to regularisation is to be accounted 

5 
 
towards the grant of benefits under Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 
1988, in view of the fact that other similarly situated employees 
have already been granted the same benefit. 
9.  
The fact that the appellants herein were regularised in service 
and the period spent by them in the work-charged establishment 
was ordered to be counted for qualifying service for pensionary and 
all other consequential benefits is not in dispute as the same is 
clearly discernible from the Policy Circular dated 13th March, 1996 
referred to supra.3 However, a significant bulk of litigation in the 
form of writ petitions4 had ensued on behalf of the employees 
engaged in the work-charged establishment, who claimed that the 
services rendered by them as work charge employee should be 
counted for the grant of benefits under the Proficiency Step-up 
Scheme, 1988 and the Assured Career Progression Scheme 
(ACPS), 1998 and their claims were accepted by the High Court of 
Punjab and Haryana but were restricted to only the Proficiency 
Step-up Scheme, 1988. Out of these writ petitions5, the order 
passed in C.W.P. No. 219 of 2003, was challenged by the State of 
Punjab before this Court in SLP(C) No. 7798 of 2004, which stands

4 C.W.P. No. 5738 of 1999, C.W.P. No. 17315 of 2001 and C.W.P. No. 219 of 2003.

dismissed vide order dated 28th April, 2004 and the order of the 
High Court was affirmed.  
10.  A perusal of the impugned judgments would reveal that the 
Division Bench treated the Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988 and 
the Assured Career Progression Scheme (ACPS), 1998 to be at par. 
However, on a perusal of the judgment passed by the learned 
Single Judge which has been affirmed by the Division Bench, it is 
clear that the learned Single Judge took note of the earlier 
judgment of the High Court, in relation to the same controversy 
passed in Principal Secretary, Irrigation Department, Punjab 
and Anr. v. President Sri Natha Singh, Thein Dam Workers 
Union (CITU) & Anr.6, which had approved the claims of the work-
charge employees in respect of the Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 
1988.7 Nevertheless, the learned Single Judge while relying upon 
the judgment in the case of Punjab State Electricity Board and 
Ors. v. Jagjiwan Ram & Ors.8, denied the relief to the appellants 
herein.  
 
6 C.W.P. No. 20422 of 2005. 
7 This order was challenged before this court in SLP(C) No. 12754 of 2006 and the said SLP 
was dismissed vide order dated 19th October, 2010. 
8 (2009) 3 SCC 661.

11.  On examining the judgments rendered by the learned Single 
Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court, we find that the 
precise connotations of the Government Circular dated 1st 
December, 1988, which had introduced the Proficiency Step-up 
Scheme were not considered in an apropos manner. The 
fundamental distinction in the present case is that the Policy 
Circular whereby, the services of the appellants were regularised, 
gave a clear mandate that the services of the work charge 
employees would be regularised, and the past services of such 
employees would be treated as qualifying service for pensionary 
and all other consequential benefits. The High Court seems to have 
overlapped the Assured Career Progression Scheme (ACPS), 1998 
and the Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988 for denying relief to the 
appellants which is not justifiable by any stretch of imagination. 
12.  This controversy was examined in a reference made to the 
Industrial Tribunal, Punjab9 in the case of President, Thein Dam 
Workers Union (CITU), Shahpur Kandi (Pathankot) v. 
Principal Secretary, Irrigation Department, Punjab & Anr.10 
The Tribunal vide its order dated 10th August, 2005 held that in 
 
9 Hereinafter, referred to as “Tribunal.” 
10 Reference No. 39 of 2004.

view of the regularisation policy dated 13th March, 1996, the work 
charge service of an employee before his regularisation is liable to 
be counted for grant of Proficiency Step-up(s). A writ petition11 filed 
by the State against the said order of the Tribunal was dismissed 
by the Division Bench of the High Court and the SLP12 preferred 
challenging the same, has been rejected by this Court vide order 
dated 19th October, 2010. Thereafter, the Irrigation Department of 
the Government of Punjab vide order dated 9th November, 2010 
unconditionally decided to implement the decision of the Tribunal.  
13.  In view of discussion made above and in the peculiar facts 
and circumstances of the instant case, we feel that the differential 
treatment could not have been meted out to the appellants herein 
who formed a part of the same establishment and were similarly 
situated to the employees who were granted the benefits under the 
Proficiency Step-up Scheme, 1988.  
14.  Resultantly, we hereby direct that the appellants shall be 
entitled to have their services in the work-charged establishment 
counted as qualifying service for Proficiency Step-up(s) in 
accordance with the Proficiency Step-up Scheme issued vide

Government Circular dated 1st December, 1988. The monetary

accordingly. The appeals are allowed in the above terms. No orders 
as to costs.
