 The 
autonomy 
and 
independence 
of 
administrative bodies are fundamental to their 
ability to perform their designated functions 
effectively. These institutions are established to 
carry out specialized tasks that require a level of 
impartiality and expertise, which can only be 
achieved if they are free from undue interference. 
Ensuring their independence is essential for

administrative 
system. 
Interfering 
in 
the 
functioning of these bodies can be detrimental, 
as it undermines their ability to operate 
efficiently and impartially. Such interference 
can stem from restrictive interpretations of their 
powers or direct interventions that impede their 
operational autonomy. Administrative bodies 
must have the freedom to establish and 
implement internal procedures and regulations 
that best suit their unique mandates and 
operational needs. The principle of non-
interference is not merely an administrative 
convenience but a cornerstone for upholding the 
rule of law and ensuring that these bodies can 
serve the public interest effectively. When these 
institutions are allowed to function without 
external pressures, they can make decisions 
based on expertise and objective criteria, which

enhances their credibility and public trust. 
2. 
 The present appeal challenges the judgment 
and order dated 21.05.2010, passed by the High 
Court of Delhi in Writ Petition (C) No. 12714 of 
2009. The High Court, by the impugned order, 
quashed the Central Information Commission 
(Management) Regulations, 2007 1  framed by 
the Chief Information Commissioner2 and held 
that the CIC has no power to constitute Benches 
of the Commission. This appeal is confined to 
the issue of the validity of the Regulations and 
the powers of the CIC under Section 12(4) of the 
Right to Information Act, 20053. 
3. 
The matter originates from an application filed 
by one Mr. Sarbjeet Roy, proforma Respondent 
No.2, under Section 18 read with Section 19 of 
 
1 In short, “the Regulations” 
2 In short, “CIC” 
3 In short, “the RTI Act”

the RTI Act, seeking information concerning the 
ongoing modification of the Master Plan of Delhi 
for the year 20214. The applicant also sought 
directions to the Delhi Development Authority5 
to fulfil its obligations under Section 4 of the RTI 
Act, which mandates proactive disclosure of 
information by public authorities. 
4. 
 On 22.09.2009, the CIC issued an order 
directing the constitution of a Committee to 
inquire into the matter of compliance with 
Section 4 of the RTI Act by the DDA and to 
submit a report to the Commission. The 
Committee comprised Ms. Sujata Chaturvedi, 
Director, Ministry of Urban Development; Shri 
Dunu Roy, Hazards Centre, Delhi; and Shri 
Pankaj KP Shreyaskar, Joint Registrar, CIC.

5. 
 Aggrieved by this order, the Contesting 
Respondent authority-DDA filed a Writ Petition 
(C) No. 12714/2009 before the Delhi High Court. 
During the proceedings before the Delhi High 
Court, the DDA specifically challenged the 
summoning of its Vice-Chairman by the CIC, 
arguing that such authority is vested solely with 
the High Court. The DDA underscored those 
certain powers, such as summoning high-
ranking 
officials 
and 
conducting 
detailed 
inquiries, were traditionally within the domain 
of Supreme Court and High Court having 
plenary powers. They argued that the CIC, as an 
administrative body, should not exercise such 
powers as it would blur the lines between 
administrative and judicial functions. However, 
the High Court expanded its examination 
beyond this specific challenge. It delved into the 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 6 of 36 
broader issue of the CIC's authority under 
Section 12(4) of the RTI Act, ultimately 
questioning and declaring the Regulations 
framed by the CIC as ultra vires. 
6. 
The High Court framed the following questions 
to determine the issues at hand:  
“I. 
Whether 
the 
Central 
Information 
Commission has the authority, under the 
RTI Act and the Rules made thereunder, to 
appoint a committee comprising individuals 
other than the Commission's members to 
investigate 
the 
implementation 
of 
obligations imposed on a public authority, 
such as the DDA, by Section 4 of the RTI 
Act?  
II. 
Whether 
the 
Chief 
Information 
Commissioner possessed the power to enact 
the 
Central 
Information 
Commission 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 7 of 36 
(Management) Regulations, 2007 under 
Section 12(4) of the RTI Act, particularly 
concerning the provisions in Chapter IV, 
which address 'registration, abatement, or 
return of appeals'?” 
III. 
Whether 
the 
Central 
Information 
Commission had the authority to mandate 
the appearance of the Vice-Chairman, DDA, 
in its proceedings?” 
 
7. 
The High Court, after examining the matter at 
length, came to the following conclusions on the 
aforementioned three questions: 
a) 
Regarding the first question, the High Court 
concluded that the CIC does not have such 
power. The Court held that the CIC's 
authority is confined to the provisions 
explicitly stated in the RTI Act, which do not 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 8 of 36 
include the power to delegate its inquiry 
responsibilities to a committee. 
b) 
On the second question, the High Court 
found that the CIC exceeded its jurisdiction. 
The Court determined that Section 12(4) of 
the RTI Act does not confer legislative power 
on the CIC to frame such Regulations, 
especially those that go beyond procedural 
management and touch upon substantive 
matters. 
c) 
As for the third question, the High Court 
concluded that such powers are reserved for 
a 
judicial 
authority, 
specifically 
the 
Supreme Court or the High Court. The 
Court held that the CIC does not possess 
the jurisdiction to summon high-ranking 
officials such as the Vice-Chairman of the 
DDA, thereby overstepping its statutory 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 9 of 36 
limits. 
8. 
 We have heard Learned Attorney General of 
India, Mr. R Venkataramani, appearing for the 
appellant, Mr. Nitin Mishra, learned counsel for 
DDA which is the Respondent No. 1 and have 
perused the submissions of Mr. Sarbajit Roy, 
Respondent No. 2. 
9. 
 The arguments of the Attorney General on 
behalf of the appellant are briefly summarized 
hereunder: 
I. 
The Central Information Commission (CIC), 
under the authority granted by Section 12(4) 
of the RTI Act, framed the Central 
Information 
Commission 
(Management) 
Regulations, 2007, to manage the affairs of 
the CIC effectively. Section 12(4) of the RTI 
Act confers upon the CIC the power of 
‘general superintendence, direction, and 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 10 of 36 
management of the affairs of the CIC’. This 
broad authority allows the CIC to take 
necessary 
actions 
for 
the 
efficient 
functioning of the Commission, including 
the formation of benches for the allocation 
of work among Information Commissioners. 
II. 
The absence of an explicit provision for the 
formation of benches in the RTI Act does not 
negate the CIC's authority to do so. The 
power to form benches is inherently 
included 
within 
the 
CIC's 
general 
superintendence 
and 
management 
responsibilities. The broad language of 
Section 12(4) of the RTI Act indicates that 
the CIC has comprehensive authority to 
organize the internal functioning of the 
Commission, which necessarily includes 
the ability to form benches for the efficient 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 11 of 36 
handling of cases. 
III. 
The ability to form benches is essential for 
the efficient disposal of the large volume of 
cases handled by the CIC. The Commission 
registers nearly 20,000 cases annually and 
deals with approximately 1,500 cases 
monthly. Hearing cases collectively by all 
the Information Commissioners and the 
CIC together would be cumbersome and 
would adversely affect the expeditious and 
effective disposal of cases. The formation of 
benches allows for the efficient allocation of 
work and ensures the timely handling of 
cases, which is crucial for upholding the 
right to information. 
IV. 
The distinction between rule-making power 
conferred upon the Central Government 
and regulation-making power conferred on 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 12 of 36 
statutory bodies like the CIC supports the 
Commission’s 
authority 
to 
frame 
Regulations for internal management and 
functional 
allocation. 
The 
regulation-
making power deals with matters of internal 
management, functional allocation, and 
measures in aid of discharge of functions. 
This 
distinction 
validates 
the 
CIC’s 
approach and underscores its authority to 
manage its affairs autonomously without 
impinging on the rule-making powers of the 
Central Government. 
V. 
The principle of non-interference is crucial 
for maintaining the integrity and efficacy of 
the CIC. Any undue interference in its 
administrative functions, such as the power 
to constitute benches, would significantly 
impede its ability to handle the large volume 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 13 of 36 
of cases efficiently and expeditiously. 
Allowing the Commission to function 
independently and exercise its powers of 
superintendence, 
direction, 
and 
management without external constraints 
is essential for fulfilling its role in promoting 
transparency and accountability. 
VI. 
The practical necessity of forming benches 
is further underscored by the large volume 
of cases the CIC handles. The Commission 
deals with a substantial number of cases 
each month, and having all Information 
Commissioners and the CIC hear cases 
collectively 
would 
be 
impractical 
and 
counterproductive. 
The 
formation 
of 
benches allows for better case management, 
timely 
disposal, 
and 
effective 
implementation of the RTI Act's objectives, 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 14 of 36 
ensuring that the right to information is 
upheld in both letter and spirit. 
 
10. On behalf of the respondent no.1-DDA, learned 
counsel stated that he has no instructions to 
address on the issue of Regulations being 
declared as ultra vires. However, respondent 
no.2 although was not present at the time of 
hearing, he has filed written submissions which 
are summarised hereunder: 
I. 
The respondents underscored that certain 
powers, such as summoning high-ranking 
officials and conducting detailed inquiries, 
were traditionally within the domain of 
judicial authorities. They argued that the 
CIC, as an administrative body, should not 
exercise such powers as it would blur the 
lines between administrative and judicial 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 15 of 36 
functions. The respondent contended that 
the High Court was correct in quashing the 
CIC’s order and Regulations to maintain the 
distinction between administrative and 
judicial roles.  
II. 
The respondent highlighted a contradiction 
between the appellant's assurances and the 
Central Government's official stance. They 
noted that the Department of Personnel and 
Training (DoPT) had consistently stated that 
orders passed by single benches of the CIC 
were void due to the lack of provisions in the 
RTI Act authorizing the CIC to constitute 
separate benches. This position had been 
conveyed to the CIC and was published on 
the 
DoPT 
website. 
The 
respondent 
referenced the DoPT's correspondence and 
legal opinions obtained from the Ministry of 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 16 of 36 
Law and Justice. These opinions confirmed 
that the RTI Act did not empower the CIC to 
constitute benches. They cited specific 
letters and internal notes from the DoPT, 
which reinforced the view that the CIC 
should function as a full commission rather 
than through benches.  
III. 
The respondents maintained that neither 
the RTI Act nor the rules made thereunder 
provided for the formation of benches by the 
CIC. They emphasized that the absence of 
explicit provisions for benches indicated 
that the legislature did not intend to grant 
such powers to the CIC. As such, the CIC’s 
action in constituting benches exceeded the 
scope of its statutory authority. 
IV. 
The respondents contended that the CIC 
had 
overstepped 
its 
jurisdiction 
by 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 17 of 36 
delegating its inquiry powers to a committee 
comprising non-members. They argued that 
only the CIC itself or its members had the 
statutory authority to conduct inquiries 
under the RTI Act. The formation of such a 
committee, according to the respondent, 
violated the provisions of the RTI Act and 
undermined the statutory framework. 
V. 
The 
respondents 
supported 
the 
High 
Court’s 
reasoning 
that 
the 
CIC’s 
Regulations exceeded the powers conferred 
by the RTI Act. They endorsed the High 
Court’s 
interpretation 
that 
the 
broad 
powers of superintendence, direction, and 
management 
did 
not 
encompass 
the 
authority 
to 
frame 
Regulations 
for 
constituting benches or forming committees 
of non-members. The respondents agreed 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 18 of 36 
with the High Court’s view that Regulation 
22 was ultra vires the RTI Act and the rules 
made thereunder. 
VI. 
The respondents highlighted the potential 
negative impact of the CIC’s actions on the 
functioning of public authorities. They 
argued 
that 
summoning 
high-ranking 
officials, such as the Vice-Chairman of the 
DDA, and constituting committees of non-
members could create an undue burden on 
public 
authorities 
and 
disrupt 
their 
functioning. The respondents maintained 
that such actions were not envisaged by the 
RTI Act and should be curtailed to ensure 
the smooth operation of public authorities. 
VII. The 
respondents 
described 
the 
CIC's 
current 
system 
as 
dysfunctional, 
highlighting issues like the establishment of 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 19 of 36 
multiple registries, arbitrary procedures, 
and a significant backlog of cases. They 
argued that the CIC's actions under the 
guise of autonomy had led to inefficiencies 
and delays, undermining the RTI Act's 
objectives. 
 
11. The CIC has approached this Court by way of 
the present appeal against the High Court's 
judgment. The appellant, while not challenging 
the quashing of the order dated 22.9.2009, 
seeks to challenge the High Court's judgment 
regarding the Regulations and the scope of the 
powers vested in the CIC under Section 12(4) of 
the RTI Act. The CIC maintains that the 
Regulations were framed within the scope of its 
statutory 
authority 
to 
ensure 
effective 
management 
and 
functioning 
of 
the 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 20 of 36 
Commission and that the ability to constitute 
Committees is an integral part of this mandate.  
 
12. Having considered the respective submissions, 
the primary issue to be considered is whether 
the CIC, under the provisions of Section 12(4) of 
the RTI Act, has the authority to constitute 
benches of the CIC and frame Regulations for 
the effective management and allocation of work 
within the Commission, including the issuance 
of orders and the formation of committees. 
 
13. At the outset, it is pertinent to elaborate on the 
relevant provisions of the RTI Act apropos the 
present issue. Section 12 of the RTI Act outlines 
the constitution and powers of the CIC. The 
Central Government is mandated to establish 
the CIC, which consists of the CIC and a 
specified number of Information Commissioners, 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 21 of 36 
not exceeding ten, as deemed necessary. 
Crucially, Section 12(4) of the RTI Act grants 
CIC the general superintendence, direction, and 
management of the Commission's affairs. This 
provision 
implies 
that 
the 
CIC 
has 
comprehensive authority to oversee and direct 
the functioning This broad section allows the 
CIC to implement measures that ensure smooth 
and efficient functioning of the Commission, 
including the formation of benches of the 
Commission, 
including 
making 
decisions 
necessary for its effective operation. 
 
14. Section 15 of the RTI Act mirrors the provisions 
of Section 12 but applies to the State 
Information 
Commissions. 
It 
similarly 
establishes the State Information Commissions 
and outlines the powers and responsibilities of 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 22 of 36 
the State Chief Information Commissioner and 
State 
Information 
Commissioners. 
Both 
Sections 12 and 15 of the RTI Act use similar 
language, emphasizing the wide-ranging powers 
of the CIC and the State Chief Information 
Commissioners to manage their respective 
commissions' affairs autonomously and without 
external interference. This language clearly 
suggests that the legislative intent was to 
provide these officials with broad authority to 
ensure their commissions function effectively. 
 
15. The High Court of Delhi, in its impugned 
judgment dated 21.05.2010, quashed the 
Regulations framed by the CIC. The Court 
specifically took issue with Regulation 22, 
which dealt with the constitution of Benches 
within the Commission. The High Court held 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 23 of 36 
that the RTI Act did not explicitly provide for the 
formation of benches by the CIC. According to 
the Court, the statutory framework and rules 
made under the RTI Act did not contain any 
provision allowing for Single or Division 
Benches of Information Commissioners. 
 
16. In our opinion, the High Court's interpretation 
was based on a restrictive reading of the RTI Act, 
focusing on the absence of explicit provisions for 
benches within the RTI Act. The High Court 
noted that Regulation 22 exceeded the limits of 
the powers prescribed under the RTI Act and 
rules. It emphasized that the RTI Act required 
orders to be pronounced in open proceedings, 
while Regulation 22 permitted orders to be 
placed on the website or communicated to 
parties, 
deviating 
from 
the 
statutory 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 24 of 36 
requirement. This Court believes that a broader 
interpretation of the RTI Act is warranted. The 
general 
superintendence, 
direction, 
and 
management powers vested in the CIC imply a 
wide- ranging authority to organize the internal 
functioning of the Commission, including the 
ability to constitute benches. This interpretation 
aligns with the purpose and objective of the RTI 
Act, which aims to facilitate the efficient 
disposal 
of 
cases 
and 
the 
effective 
implementation of the right to information. 
 
17. The absence of an explicit provision for Benches 
does not negate the CIC's authority to constitute 
them, as such powers are implicitly included 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
CIC's 
general 
superintendence 
and 
management 
responsibilities. The broad language of the RTI 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 25 of 36 
Act indicates an intention to grant the CIC 
comprehensive authority to ensure the effective 
and efficient functioning of the Commission. 
The Delhi High Court's narrow reading of the 
provisions overlooked the inherent powers of the 
CIC to manage the affairs of the Commission. 
The RTI Act's broad language suggests that the 
legislative intent was to provide the CIC with the 
necessary authority to implement measures 
that 
ensure 
the 
Commission's 
effective 
operation. 
 
18. In the present case, the RTI Act should be 
interpreted purposively, taking into account the 
broader objectives of the legislation. The 
purpose of the RTI Act is to promote 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
in 
the 
functioning of public authorities, ensuring 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 26 of 36 
citizens' right to information. To achieve these 
objectives effectively, it is essential that the 
Central 
Information 
Commission 
operates 
efficiently 
and 
without 
undue 
procedural 
constraints. 
The 
principle 
of 
purposive 
interpretation supports the view that the CIC's 
powers under Section 12(4) of the RTI Act 
include all necessary measures to manage and 
direct the Commission's affairs effectively. This 
includes the ability to form benches to handle 
the increasing volume of cases. The formation of 
Benches allows for the efficient allocation of 
work and ensures the timely disposal of cases, 
which is crucial for upholding the right to 
information. 
 
19. Furthermore, the High Court's reliance on the 
absence of explicit provisions for Benches 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 27 of 36 
overlooks the broad language of Sections 12(4) 
and 15(4) of the RTI Act, which grants the CIC 
and State Chief Information Commissioners 
wide-ranging powers to manage their respective 
Commissions' affairs. The legislative intent, as 
reflected by the broad language of these 
provisions, was to provide these officials with 
the necessary authority to ensure that their 
Commissions function effectively and efficiently. 
These provisions explicitly use the words 
“superintendence, direction and management” 
of the affairs of the Commission. There have 
been various landmark judgements of this 
Court which have interpreted the words 
"superintendence, 
direction, 
and 
control" 
occurring in Article 324 (1) of the Constitution 
in respect of the Election Commission.   
 
20. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Election 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 28 of 36 
Commission of India v. Ashok Kumar6, has 
recognized the wide ambit of the powers given to 
the 
Election 
Commission 
for 
the 
superintendence, direction, and control of the 
Election process.  
“…13. Article 324 of the Constitution 
contemplates constitution of the Election 
Commission in which shall vest the 
superintendence, direction and control of 
the preparation of the electoral rolls for, 
and the conduct of, all elections to 
Parliament and to the legislature of every 
State and of elections to the offices of 
President and Vice-President held under 
the 
Constitution. 
The 
words 
“superintendence, direction and control” 
have a wide connotation so as to include 
therein such powers which though not 
specifically provided but are necessary to 
be exercised for effectively accomplishing 
the task of holding the elections to their 
completion…” 
 
 
21. Similarly, in Union of India Vs. Association for 
 
6  (2000) 8 SCC 216 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 29 of 36 
Democratic Reforms7, this Court has held that 
Article 324 allows the Election Commission to 
operate in areas of laws which are not explicitly 
mentioned in the legislation. 
*** 
“ 26. The aforesaid decision of the 
Constitution Bench unreservedly lays 
down that in democracy the little man — 
voter — has overwhelming importance on 
the point and the little-large Indian (voter) 
should not be hijacked from the course of 
free and fair elections by subtle perversion 
of discretion of casting votes. In a 
continual 
participative 
operation 
of 
periodical election, the voter does a social 
audit of his candidate and for such audit 
he must be well informed about the past of 
his 
candidate. 
Further, 
Article 
324 
operates in areas left unoccupied by 
legislation 
and 
the 
words 
“superintendence, direction and control” 
as well as “conduct of all elections” are the 
broadest terms. The silence of statute has 
no exclusionary effect except where it flows 
from necessary implication. Therefore, in 
our view, it would be difficult to accept the 
 
7 (2002) 5 SCC 294 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 30 of 36 
contention raised by Mr Salve, learned 
Solicitor-General and Mr Ashwani Kumar, 
learned Senior Counsel appearing on 
behalf of the intervenor that if there is no 
provision in the Act or the Rules, the High 
Court ought not to have issued such 
directions to the Election Commission. It 
is 
settled 
that 
the 
power 
of 
the 
Commission is plenary in character in 
exercise thereof. In statutory provisions or 
rules, it is known that every contingency 
could not be foreseen or anticipated with 
precision, therefore, the Commission can 
cope with a situation where the field is 
unoccupied by issuing necessary orders.” 
 
 
22. Therefore, 
the 
use 
of 
the 
words 
“superintendence, direction and management” 
in Sections 12(4) and 15(4) of the RTI Act clearly 
provides the CIC an ambit of power wide enough 
to frame its own Regulations and to delegate its 
power to a committee formed by it.  The Central 
Information Commission, utilizing these broad 
powers, has enacted 'The Central Information 

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2230 OF 2012 
 
Page 31 of 36 
Commission (Management) Regulations, 2007.' 
While the RTI Act does not explicitly grant CIC 
the 
authority 
to 
frame 
Regulations, 
the 
overarching powers granted under Section 12(4) 
of the RTI Act inherently include the ability to 
manage the Commission’s affairs effectively. 
These Regulations are essential tools for 
ensuring the efficient administration and 
operation of 
the 
Commission, 
addressing 
various procedural and managerial aspects 
necessary for fulfilling its mandate. Focusing 
narrowly on the nomenclature and the absence 
of an explicit provision for Regulation-making 
within the RTI Act would undermine the broader 
purpose 
and 
intent 
of 
the 
same. 
The 
nomenclature 
used 
to 
describe 
these 
Regulations should not detract from their 
necessity and their role in facilitating the

Commission’s 
functioning. 
A 
purposive 
interpretation of Section 12(4) of the RTI Act 
reveals that the powers of "superintendence, 
direction and management" are intended to be 
comprehensive, enabling the CIC to adopt 
measures, including the framing of Regulations, 
that ensure transparency, accountability, and 
efficient handling of its responsibilities. Thus, 
the creation of these Regulations is not only 
justified but crucial for the CIC to manage its 
workload and operational demands effectively, 
thereby serving the core objectives of the RTI Act. 
 
23. At this juncture, it is necessary to elucidate that 
under Section 12(4) of the RTI Act, the CIC has 
the authority to issue various forms of 
administrative 
guidelines, 
directives 
and 
instructions

management

The 
'Central 
Information 
Commission 
(Management) 
Regulations, 2007,' framed by the CIC, could 
have been pronounced as 'Circulars,' 'By-laws,' 
or any other similar administrative orders. The 
primary objections have been raised due to the 
word "Regulations," which respondents argue, 
confers the gravity of a separate legislation. 
However, 
this 
interpretation 
misses 
the 
substantive purpose behind these measures. 
The use of the term "Regulations" should not 
detract from their function, which is akin to any 
other administrative orders or circulars that an 
authority like the CIC might promulgate to 
ensure the smooth operation of its duties. The 
essence of these regulations lies in their role in 
facilitating 
the 
internal 
management 
and 
procedural operations of the Commission, a

necessity clearly envisioned by the broad 
powers of superintendence, direction, and 
management granted under Section 12(4) of the 
RTI Act. By focusing on the terminology, the 
objections fail to appreciate the functional 
equivalence of these regulations to other forms 
of administrative guidance. The regulations 
were crafted to address the practical needs of 
the Commission, providing structure and clarity 
to its operations, in any administrative context. 
Therefore, raising objections based solely on the 
label "Regulations" is an exercise in semantics 
rather than a substantive argument. 
 
24. We believe that the autonomy of the Central 
Information Commission is of paramount 
importance to its effective functioning. Any 
undue 
interference 
in 
its 
administrative

functions, such as the power to constitute 
benches, would significantly impede its ability 
to handle the large volume of cases efficiently 
and expeditiously. The CIC must be allowed to 
operate independently and exercise its powers 
of superintendence, direction, and management 
without external constraints. The principle of 
non-interference is crucial for maintaining the 
integrity and efficacy of the CIC. Allowing the 
Commission to function autonomously ensures 
that it can fulfil its role in promoting 
transparency and accountability, which are the 
cornerstones of the RTI Act. The ability to form 
benches and allocate work among Information 
Commissioners is essential for the CIC to 
manage its workload effectively and uphold the 
citizens' right to information.

25. The appeal is accordingly allowed, and the 
judgment of the Delhi High Court, is set aside. 
The Chief Information Commissioner’s powers 
to frame Regulations pertaining to constitution 
of Benches of the Commission are upheld as 
such powers are within the ambit of Section 
12(4) of the RTI Act.
