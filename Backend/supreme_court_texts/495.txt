Vikas Kanaujia against the impugned order of

the High Court allowed the appeal and set aside 
the decree of divorce granted by the Family 
Court, Meerut on 20.12.2006 in Matrimonial 
Case No. 123 of 2003 filed by the Appellant. The 
Appellant-husband had filed the petition for

Hindu Marriage Act, 19551 on the ground of 
Cruelty.  
3. The factual matrix of the case, along with the 
record of multiple legal proceedings between the 
parties, is summarised as follows: 
4. Appellant-Dr. Vikas Kanaujia and Respondent-
Dr. Sarita got married to each other on 
20.02.2002 in accordance with Hindu Rites and 
Customs. The Respondent-wife came to her 
marital 
home 
at 
Meerut. 
The 
Appellant 
submitted in his plaint, that marriage was 
consummated but later the relationship between 
parties was strained as Respondent refused to 
perform marital obligations and misbehaved with 
his mother. On 22.02.2002, the younger brother 
and maternal aunt of the Respondent allegedly 
visited the house and the Respondent left for her 
paternal home along with them. The Appellant 
brought 
her 
back 
to 
marital 
home 
on 
04.03.2002. Afterwards both the Appellant and 
Respondent went to Udhampur (Jammu and 
Kashmir) where the Appellant was working as an

eye surgeon. However, the Appellant claims that 
behaviour of Respondent was cold and indifferent 
towards him. They both returned on 11.03.2002. 
On 17.03.2002 the Thirteenth day function 
(Terahi Ceremony) was held for a family member 
of Appellant. On the evening of same day, the 
Respondent left her marital home. Since then, 
the Respondent is residing at her paternal home. 
Thus, the Appellant and Respondent have lived 
together for barely 23 days as the Respondent 
shifted to her paternal home before completing 
even a month at her marital home.  
5. The Appellant states that he made repeated 
attempts to bring back the Respondent but he 
failed as Respondent refused to live with him. 
Thus, the Appellant filed a suit under Section 9 
of HMA for restitution of conjugal rights as Suit 
No. 598 of 2002. The Respondent, on the other 
hand, filed an application under Section 24 of the 
HMA for maintenance as Suit No. 336 of 2002. 
Both the cases were listed together before the 
Family Court on 28.11.2002 however allegedly 
the Respondent and her father misbehaved with 
the father of Appellant on the day of proceedings. 

SLP(C) No. 29464 of 2019

Since 
no 
attempts 
of 
reconciliation 
were 
successful, on 26.02.2003 the Appellant filed a 
suit for dissolution of marriage under Section 13 
of the HMA on the ground of ‘Cruelty’ as 
Matrimonial Case No. 123 of 2003. Appellant 
claimed ‘cruelty’ against Respondent on two 
grounds. First, the Respondent did not fulfil her 
marital obligation by depriving the Appellant of 
his conjugal rights. Second, the Respondent 
caused mental cruelty by her temperament and 
misbehaviour with family members of Appellant. 
On the other hand, in the Written Statement the 
Respondent-wife has stated that Appellant was 
unhappy in marriage since day one. She never 
refused to join the company of Appellant and live 
together. But the Appellant and his family 
wanted to remarry him for dowry. They had 
allegedly demanded dowry from Respondent as 
well.  
6. While the proceedings in Matrimonial suit were 
pending, on 31.07.2006 the Family Court 
rejected the application filed by Respondent 
seeking maintenance under Section 24 of HMA, 

SLP(C) No. 29464 of 2019 
 
Page 5 of 14 
on the ground that Respondent was also a doctor 
and her earnings are at par with the Appellant.  
7. The suit for restitution of conjugal rights was 
later 
withdrawn 
by 
the 
Appellant. 
On 
26.05.2003, the Respondent wife filed a petition 
under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1973 seeking maintenance as Case 
no. 89 of 2011. It was dismissed on 29.11.2013 
on the ground that Respondent was earning at 
par with Appellant and thus not entitled to 
maintenance.  
8. Further, on 24.02.2004 the Respondent filed 
Criminal complaint at Meerut under Sections 
498A, 406 and 34 of Indian Penal Code, 18602 
against the Appellant, his parents and siblings. 
In this complaint she alleged mental harassment, 
dowry demand and retention of the dowry 
articles by the accused persons in her marital 
home, 
against 
the 
accused 
persons. 
On 
05.11.2004, FIR bearing No. 965/2004 was 
registered 
against 
the 
Appellant 
and 
abovementioned 
family 
members. 
As 
the

Sessions Court passed an order for Conciliation 
on 15.06.2005, the Appellant and Respondent 
lived together for 20 days from 15.06.2005 to 
05.07.2005. However, on 05.07.2005, the police 
arrested family members of Appellant- his 
mother, father, sister and father, who were 
subsequently granted bail.  
9. On 20.12.2006, the Family Court passed final 
order in Matrimonial Case No. 123 of 2003 by 
granting decree of divorce to Appellant. It decreed 
the suit on the ground of cruelty holding that 
Respondent 
had 
initiated 
false 
criminal 
proceedings against the Appellant. Thus, the 
Respondent filed First Appeal No. 31 of 2007 
before the High Court.  
10. Meanwhile on 08.07.2013, the Metropolitan 
Magistrate discharged the father, brother, and 
sister of the Appellant from all charges in 
connection with FIR No. 965 of 2004. The 
Respondent filed application for framing charges 
under Section 498A of IPC against the brother 
and sister of Appellant. However, the Magistrate 
rejected this application on 26.11.2013. On 
18.12.2017, the Metropolitan Magistrate passed 

SLP(C) No. 29464 of 2019 
 
Page 7 of 14 
final order acquitting the Appellant and his 
mother. The Respondent filed Appeal before the 
Sessions Court. On 02.03.2023, the Sessions 
Court upheld the acquittal order passed by trial 
court.  
11. By the Impugned order passed on 22.08.2019, 
the High Court allowed the appeal of Respondent 
filed in matrimonial case against the order of 
Family Court, thereby dismissing the petition to 
grant divorce. The High Court denied the ground 
of irretrievable breakdown of marriage stating 
that parties have not been living separately on 
account of their free will. It was the appellant who 
refused to co-habit with the Respondent and she 
herself did not desert him. Thus, the Appellant 
has approached this Court against the order of 
High Court which denied him divorce. 
12. Afterwards, allegedly the Respondent visited 
residence of Appellant and made unsavoury 
enquiries in neighbourhood. She further filed a 
Missing 
Persons 
Complaint 
alleging 
that 
Appellant is missing. On 07.10.2019, the 
Respondent entered into the workplace of 
Appellant in OPD area of department of 

SLP(C) No. 29464 of 2019 
 
Page 8 of 14 
Ophthalmology in Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate 
Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow along 
with police personnel, causing disturbance in the 
department. The Appellant even got a warning 
letter from the head of the department to resolve 
personal grievances outside the premises. The 
police frequently visited the department and 
made enquiries about appellant in connection 
with the Missing complaint filed by Respondent.  
13. We have heard learned counsel for the parties 
and perused the material on record. We are of the 
opinion that this is a fit case to exercise powers 
conferred on this Court under Article 142 of the 
Constitution of India. A Constitution Bench of 
this Court in Shilpa Shailesh v. Varun 
Sreenivasan3 has held that this Court has the 
discretion to dissolve the marriage on the ground 
of irretrievable breakdown of marriage in order to 
do ‘complete justice’ to the parties, even if one 
spouse opposes such prayer. Relevant portion of 
Paragraph 50 of the judgment is reproduced 
hereunder: 
 
3 2023 SCC OnLine SC 544 

SLP(C) No. 29464 of 2019 
 
Page 9 of 14 
“……… …………. ……….. 
(iii) Whether this Court can grant divorce 
in exercise of power under Article 142(1) of 
the Constitution of India when there is 
complete and irretrievable breakdown of 
marriage in spite of the other spouses 
opposing the prayer? 
This question is also answered in the 
affirmative, inter alia, holding that this 
Court, in exercise of power under Article 
142 (1) of the Constitution of India, has the 
discretion to dissolve the marriage on the 
ground of its irretrievable breakdown. This 
discretionary power is to be exercised to do 
'complete justice to the parties, wherein 
this Court is satisfied that the facts 
established show that the marriage has 
completely failed and there is no possibility 
that the parties will cohabit together, and 
continuation 
of 
the 
formal 
legal 
relationship is unjustified. The Court, as a 
court of equity, is required to also balance 
the circumstances and the background in 
which the party opposing the dissolution is 
placed.” 
 
14. In the present case we are convinced that the 
marriage has failed completely and there is no 
possibility of parties living together and thus the 
continuation of further legal relationship is 
unjustified.  

SLP(C) No. 29464 of 2019

15. The husband and wife have lived together on 
their own will for hardly 23 days since marriage. 
They further lived together for 20 more days from 
15.06.2005 to 05.07.2015 as Sessions Court 
passed order for conciliation. Thus, in total the 
parties have not lived together for more than 43 
days. The Respondent left her matrimonial house 
within the first month of marriage. The period of 
separation has been more than 22 years. The 
possibility of parties living together is further 
reduced as parties are in their early 50s now and 
have built independent lives. Further, the parties 
have fought multiple legal battles against each 
other since 2002 itself with six cases filed against 
each other, including criminal cases. The 
Respondent had filed a criminal case against the 
Appellant and his family members where they 
were arrested although subsequently discharged 
and acquitted.  
16. Although the Respondent claims that she is 
willing to live with the Appellant believing in the 
sanctity of marriage, her actions are not in 
consonance with her claim. In this long period of 
22 years, there was no one to stop her from living 

SLP(C) No. 29464 of 2019 
 
Page 11 of 14 
together with the Appellant. The mediation and 
conciliation 
proceedings 
have 
failed. 
The 
Appellant on the other hand states that the claim 
of willingness to live together is falsely projected 
claim before the Court of law only to mislead the 
Court, delay the proceedings and harass the 
appellant.  
17. Thus, the effective cumulation of actions of both 
the parties in past 22 years since marriage has 
resulted in demolition of their matrimonial bond 
beyond repair. The marriage has ceased to exist 
both in substance and in reality. The relation has 
even taken a sour taste as the families of parties 
have also developed rivalries. The act of 
Respondent to lodge a missing complaint against 
Appellant after the delivery of impugned order is 
also indicative of the bitter relation between the 
parties. Considering the long separation period of 
22 years, lack of existence of marriage between 
the parties and the sour relations developed due 
to continuous legal battles, we deem this case to 
be fit for exercise of extraordinary powers 
conferred under Article 142 of the Constitution.

18. In the case of Rajib Kumar Roy vs Sushmita 
Saha4, this Court exercised the power conferred 
under Article 142 of the Constitution of India by 
dissolving the marriage between parties who 
were living separately for 12 years. Paragraph 
Nos. 9,10 and 11 of the judgement are 
reproduced hereunder:  
 
 “9. Continued bitterness, dead emotions and 
long separation, in the given facts and 
circumstances of a case, can be construed 
as a case of “irretrievable breakdown of 
marriage”, which is also a facet of “cruelty”. 
In Rakesh Raman v. Kavita, 2023 SCC 
OnLine SC 497, this is precisely what was 
held, that though in a given case cruelty as 
a fault, may not be attributable to one 
party alone and hence despite irretrievable 
breakdown of marriage keeping the parties 
together amounts to cruelty on both sides. 
Which is precisely the case at hand. 
 10.Whatever may be the justification for the 
two living separately, with so much of time 
gone by, any marital love or affection, 
which may have been between the parties, 
seems to have dried up. This is a classic 
case 
of 
irretrievable 
breakdown 
of

marriage. In view of the Constitution 
Bench Judgment of this court in Shilpa 
Sailesh v. Varun Sreenivasan, 2023 SCC 
OnLine SC 544 which has held that in 
such cases where there is irretrievable 
breakdown of marriage then dissolution of 
marriage is the only solution and this 
Court can grant a decree of divorce in 
exercise of its power under Article 142 of 
the Constitution of India. 
 11.We therefore declare the marriage to have 
broken down irretrievably and therefore in 
exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 
142 of the Constitution of India we are of 
the considered opinion that this being a 
case of irretrievable breakdown of marriage 
must now be dissolved by grant of decree 
of divorce.” 
 
19. In light of the facts and circumstances of the 
present case, along with powers conferred under 
Article 142 of the Constitution of India and 
judicial precedents discussed herein, we hereby 
grant the decree of divorce on account of 
irretrievable breakdown of marriage. As both the 
parties are professionally qualified medical 
doctors and have sufficient and equal earnings, 

SLP(C) No. 29464 of 2019 
 
Page 14 of 14 
we are not inclined to award any permanent 
alimony. 
20. The judgement dated 22.08.2019 passed by the 
High Court of Allahabad is hereby set aside. The 
marriage between the parties is dissolved, 
exercising powers under Article 142 of the 
Constitution of India. The present appeal is 
accordingly allowed.  
21. Pending application(s), if any, is/are disposed of.
