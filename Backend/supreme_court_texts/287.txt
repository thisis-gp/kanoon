This appeal challenges the order dated 4th February 
2022, passed by the Division Bench of the High Court for the 
State of Telangana at Hyderabad in Writ Petition No. 5275 of 
2021, whereby the High Court disposed of the writ petition 
filed by Dr. M.V. Ramana Rao, respondent No. 3 herein 
(hereinafter referred to as ‘the Borrower’). The High Court set 
aside the order dated 2nd February 2021, passed by the Debts 
Recovery Tribunal-II at Hyderabad (hereinafter referred to as 
‘DRT’) and allowed Miscellaneous Application (M.A.) No. 97 of 
2020 in Securitization Application (S.A.) No. 1476 of 2017 filed 

2 
 
by the Borrower for the restoration of the said S.A. No. 1476 
of 2017 filed by him under Section 17 of the Securitization and 
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of 
Security Interest Act, 2002 (‘SARFAESI Act’ for short). The 
Borrower had filed S.A. No. 1476 of 2017 against the Notice 
dated 2nd September 2017 issued by the UCO Bank 
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Respondent-Bank’) for the sale 
of his mortgaged properties which was to be conducted by the 
Authorized Officer (Respondent No.2) of the Respondent-Bank 
in light of the default in repayment of loan by the Borrower. 
The DRT, in its aforementioned order dated 2nd February 2021, 
had dismissed the M.A. No. 97 of 2020 for the restoration of 
S.A. No. 1476 of 2017, which had been previously dismissed 
as withdrawn vide DRT vide order dated 21st September 2020. 
The Division Bench of the High Court, in the impugned order, 
while setting aside the order of DRT dated 2nd February 2021, 
further directed DRT to proceed with S.A. No. 1476 of 2017 in 
accordance with law. 
3. 
The facts, in brief, giving rise to the present appeal are as 
under: 

3 
 
3.1 The Borrower had availed a loan from the Respondent-
Bank and in order to secure the said loan, the Borrower had 
mortgaged four properties (hereinafter referred to as 
‘scheduled properties’) situated at Vijayawada, Andhra 
Pradesh as collateral security. However, the Borrower 
defaulted in the repayment of the loan amount, which led the 
Respondent-Bank to initiate proceedings against the borrower 
under the SARFAESI Act. 
3.2 Thereafter, the Respondent-Bank issued an Auction Sale 
Notice on 2nd September 2017 for auctioning off the scheduled 
properties and published information about the same in the 
Times of India and one other vernacular newspaper. According 
to the said Auction Sale Notice, the auction was to be 
conducted on 14th December 2017. 
3.3 Aggrieved by the Auction Sale Notice, the Borrower 
preferred a securitization application being S.A. No.1476 of 
2017 before DRT under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act, 
thereby inter alia praying for setting aside of the same. 
3.4 In the meanwhile, the auction was conducted on 14th 
December 2017 by the Respondent-Bank through Respondent 
No.2. The PHR Invent Educational Society, (hereinafter 

4 
 
referred to as the ‘auction purchaser’), i.e., the appellant 
herein participated in the said auction and emerged as the 
highest bidder for a bid of Rs.5,72,22,200/-. The appellant 
deposited 25% of the bid amount i.e. Rs. 1,38,05,550/- 
including the Earnest Money Deposit of the said amount.  The 
fact remains that the Borrower did not deposit the amount. 
3.5 On the same day i.e., 14th December 2017, DRT passed 
an interim order in S.A. No. 1476 of 2017, thereby refusing to 
interfere with the sale of the scheduled properties which was 
to be conducted on that very day. The Borrower had also filed 
an interlocutory application being I.A. No. 3446 of 2017, 
thereby praying for stay of further proceedings qua the auction 
of the scheduled properties, wherein DRT directed the 
Respondent-Bank not to confirm the sale of the scheduled 
properties subject to the Borrower depositing 30% of the 
outstanding dues as claimed for in the Auction Sale Notice in 
two equal installments. The first installment of 15% amount 
was to be deposited within a week from the date of the said 
order, and the second installment of 15% amount was to be 
deposited within two weeks thereafter. The DRT further 
directed that, in the event that the Borrower failed to make the 

5 
 
aforesaid deposits, the interim stay would stand vacated and 
the Respondent-Bank would be at liberty to confirm the sale 
in favor of the highest bidder, although the sale itself was 
made subject to the final outcome in S.A. No. 1476 of 2017. 
3.6 Subsequently, the appellant deposited Rs.4,29,16,650/- 
towards the payment of the balance auction price on 28th 
December 2017. 
3.7 In the meanwhile, the Borrower proposed One Time 
Settlement (‘OTS’ for short) for all the outstanding loan 
accounts. However, the Respondent-Bank refused to accept 
the same and requested the Borrower to settle all the 
outstanding loan accounts with interest payable at the 
contractual rate, as applicable thereon vide letter dated 12th 
May 2020. 
3.8 Following which, DRT passed an order dated 21st 
September 2020, whereby S.A. No. 1476 of 2017 was 
dismissed as withdrawn at the behest of the Borrower who 
submitted that the matter had been settled out of court. On 
the other hand, the Respondent-Bank filed a Memo of Non-
Settlement before DRT thereby informing that no such out-of-
court settlement had been reached.  

6 
 
3.9 Upon S.A. No. 1476 of 2017 being dismissed as 
withdrawn, the Respondent-Bank confirmed the sale of the 
scheduled properties in favor of the appellant herein. A Sale 
Certificate was issued by the Respondent-Bank on 2nd 
November 2020 and the possession of the scheduled 
properties was accordingly delivered to the appellant. 
Subsequently, on 11th November 2020, the Sale Certificate 
came to be registered in favor of the appellant herein. 
3.10 In the meantime, the Borrower preferred M.A. No. 97 of 
2020 in S.A. No. 1476 of 2017 before DRT, praying for the 
restoration of S.A. No. 1476 of 2017 to the file and setting aside 
the aforesaid order of DRT dated 21st September 2020. 
However, on 2nd February 2021, DRT passed an order thereby 
dismissing the said M.A. filed by the Borrower.  
3.11 Aggrieved thereby, the Borrower filed writ petition before 
the High Court. The High Court, by the impugned order, 
disposed of the said writ petition, thereby setting aside the 
order of DRT, and further directing it to proceed with S.A. No. 
1476 of 2017 in accordance with law. The M.A. No. 97 of 2020 
in S.A. No. 1476 of 2017 was thus allowed restoring S.A. No. 
1476 of 2017.

4. 
Being aggrieved thus, the auction purchaser has 
preferred the present appeal. 
5. 
We have heard Shri R. Basant, learned Senior Counsel 
appearing on behalf of the appellant-auction purchaser, Shri 
Partha Sil, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the UCO 
Bank and Shri Jayant Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel 
appearing on behalf of the respondent No.3-Borrower. 
6. 
Shri Basant, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the 
appellant-auction purchaser submitted that the High Court 
has grossly erred in entertaining the writ petition filed by the 
Borrower when an efficacious alternative remedy of statutory 
appeal was available to the Borrower under the SARFAESI Act.  
He relies on the judgments of this Court in the cases of United 
Bank of India v. Satyawati Tondon and Others1, Celir LLP 
v. Bafna Motors (Mumbai) Private Limited and Others2 and 
South Indian Bank Limited and Others v. Naveen Mathew 
Philip and Another3. 
7. 
Shri Basant further submitted that the conduct of the 
Borrower also disentitled him to an equitable relief.  It is 
 
1 (2010) 8 SCC 110 : 2010 INSC 428 
2 (2024) 2 SCC 1 : 2023 INSC 838 
3 2023 SCC OnLine SC 435 : 2023 INSC 379 

8 
 
submitted that the Borrower had filed the writ petition after 
the entire payment was made by the appellant-auction 
purchaser and a Sale Certificate was also issued in its favour.  
The learned Senior Counsel therefore submitted that the writ 
petition filed by the Borrower deserves to be dismissed and the 
present appeal deserves to be allowed. 
8. 
Shri Partha Sil, learned counsel appearing on behalf of 
the UCO Bank, also advanced similar arguments and prayed 
for dismissal of the writ petition filed by the Borrower. 
9. 
Shri Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on 
behalf of the Borrower, on the contrary, submitted that non-
exercising of the jurisdiction under Article 226/227 of the 
Constitution of India on the ground of availability of an 
alternative remedy is a rule of self-restraint.  It is submitted 
that, in deserving cases, the High Court is not precluded from 
entertaining a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution in 
order to do justice to the parties.  The learned Senior Counsel 
relies on the judgment of this Court in the case of State of 
U.P. v. Mohammad Nooh4. 
 
4 AIR 1958 SC 86 : 1957 INSC 81

10. The facts in the present case are not disputed.  It is not 
in dispute that in the auction held on 14th December 2017, the 
appellant-auction purchaser was the highest bidder having 
offered a bid for an amount of Rs.5,72,22,200/- and that the 
appellant-auction purchaser deposited 25% of the bid amount 
i.e. Rs.1,38,05,550/- immediately.  It is also not in dispute 
that on 14th December 2017, the learned DRT, though refused 
to interfere with the sale but directed the Respondent-Bank 
not to confirm the sale of the scheduled properties subject to 
the Borrower depositing 30% of the outstanding dues in two 
equal installments within one week and two weeks thereafter 
respectively.  The learned DRT had also directed that, in case 
of failure of compliance, the interim stay would stand 
automatically vacated and the Respondent-Bank would be 
entitled to confirm the sale.  It is also not in dispute that the 
Borrower did not comply with the said order of the learned 
DRT.  It is thus clear that, on non-deposit of the amount as 
directed by the learned DRT vide order dated 14th December 
2017, the interim direction passed on the said date stood 
automatically vacated.  After the aforesaid period was over, the 
appellant-auction purchaser deposited the balance amount of 

10 
 
Rs.4,29,16,650/-. 
11. It appears that, during the pendency of the proceedings 
before the learned DRT, the Borrower submitted an OTS 
proposal to the Respondent-Bank on 29th March 2019, thereby 
offering 
to 
settle 
the 
accounts 
for 
an 
amount 
of 
Rs.3,75,00,000/-.  It further appears that the Borrower also 
deposited 10% upfront amount i.e. Rs.37,50,000/-.  On 12th 
May 2020, the Respondent-Bank, in reply to the OTS 
application, asked the Borrower to settle all the four loan 
accounts with interest at the contractual rate.   
12. On 20th August 2020, the Borrower filed an application 
being I.A. No. 1691 of 2020 in the proceedings pending before 
DRT requesting for advancing the date of hearing stating that 
there was urgency in the matter and also that the appellant-
auction purchaser had withdrawn from the auction.  
Thereafter, vide order dated 21st September 2020, the said S.A. 
No. 1476 of 2017 came to be withdrawn on a statement made 
by the counsel for the Borrower that the matter had been 
settled out of court.  It is also relevant to mention that on 5th 
October 2020, the Respondent-Bank had filed a memo before 
DRT informing that there was no settlement.   

11 
 
13. After the disposal of the S.A. No. 1476 of 2017 as 
withdrawn, the Respondent-Bank confirmed the sale in favour 
of the appellant-auction purchaser on 2nd November 2020.  
Thereafter, on 4th November 2020, the Borrower filed a 
miscellaneous application being M.A. No. 97 of 2010 for 
restoration of the said S.A. No. 1476 of 2017 on the ground 
that the said S.A. No. 1476 of 2017 had been withdrawn 
because the Chief Manager and AGM of the Respondent-Bank 
had orally told the Borrower that unless the S.A. No. 1476 of 
2017 was withdrawn, they could not process the OTS 
proposal. It is further relevant to note that on 11th November 
2020, the Sale Certificate was registered.  Vide order dated 2nd 
February 2021, DRT dismissed the said M.A. No. 97 of 2010.  
Thereafter, the writ petition being No. 5275 of 2021 came to 
be filed by the Borrower on 25th February 2021 before the High 
Court.  Vide the impugned order, the High Court set aside the 
order passed by DRT and directed it to proceed with S.A. No. 
1476 of 2017. 
14. The law with regard to entertaining a petition under 
Article 226 of the Constitution in case of availability of 
alternative remedy is well settled.  In the case of Satyawati 

12 
 
Tondon (supra), this Court observed thus: 
“43. Unfortunately, the High Court overlooked the 
settled law that the High Court will ordinarily not 
entertain a petition under Article 226 of the 
Constitution if an effective remedy is available to the 
aggrieved person and that this rule applies with 
greater rigour in matters involving recovery of taxes, 
cess, fees, other types of public money and the dues 
of banks and other financial institutions. In our view, 
while dealing with the petitions involving challenge to 
the action taken for recovery of the public dues, etc. 
the High Court must keep in mind that the 
legislations enacted by Parliament and State 
Legislatures for recovery of such dues are a code unto 
themselves inasmuch as they not only contain 
comprehensive procedure for recovery of the dues 
but also envisage constitution of quasi-judicial 
bodies for redressal of the grievance of any aggrieved 
person. Therefore, in all such cases, the High Court 
must insist that before availing remedy under Article 
226 of the Constitution, a person must exhaust the 
remedies available under the relevant statute. 
44. While expressing the aforesaid view, we are 
conscious that the powers conferred upon the High 
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution to issue 
to any person or authority, including in appropriate 
cases, any Government, directions, orders or writs 
including 
the 
five 
prerogative 
writs 
for 
the 
enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III 
or for any other purpose are very wide and there is 
no express limitation on exercise of that power but, 
at the same time, we cannot be oblivious of the rules 
of self-imposed restraint evolved by this Court, which 
every High Court is bound to keep in view while 
exercising 
power 
under 
Article 
226 
of 
the 
Constitution. 
45. It is true that the rule of exhaustion of alternative 
remedy is a rule of discretion and not one of 
compulsion, but it is difficult to fathom any reason 
why the High Court should entertain a petition filed 

13 
 
under Article 226 of the Constitution and pass 
interim order ignoring the fact that the petitioner can 
avail 
effective 
alternative 
remedy 
by 
filing 
application, appeal, revision, etc. and the particular 
legislation contains a detailed mechanism for 
redressal of his grievance.” 
 
15. It could thus be seen that, this Court has clearly held 
that the High Court will ordinarily not entertain a petition 
under Article 226 of the Constitution if an effective remedy is 
available to the aggrieved person.  It has been held that this 
rule applies with greater rigour in matters involving recovery 
of taxes, cess, fees, other types of public money and the dues 
of banks and other financial institutions.  The Court clearly 
observed that, while dealing with the petitions involving 
challenge to the action taken for recovery of the public dues, 
etc., the High Court must keep in mind that the legislations 
enacted by Parliament and State Legislatures for recovery of 
such dues are a code unto themselves inasmuch as they not 
only contain comprehensive procedure for recovery of the dues 
but also envisage constitution of quasi-judicial bodies for 
redressal of the grievance of any aggrieved person. It has been 
held that, though the powers of the High Court under Article 
226 of the Constitution are of widest amplitude, still the 
Courts cannot be oblivious of the rules of self-imposed 

14 
 
restraint evolved by this Court.  The Court further held that 
though the rule of exhaustion of alternative remedy is a rule 
of discretion and not one of compulsion, still it is difficult to 
fathom any reason why the High Court should entertain a 
petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution. 
16. The view taken by this Court has been followed in the 
case of Agarwal Tracom Private Limited v. Punjab 
National Bank and Others5. 
17. In the case of Authorized Officer, State Bank of 
Travancore and Another v. Mathew K.C.6, this Court was 
considering an appeal against an interim order passed by the 
High Court in a writ petition under Article 226 of the 
Constitution staying further proceedings at the stage of 
Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act. After considering various 
judgments rendered by this Court, the Court observed thus: 
“16. The writ petition ought not to have been 
entertained and the interim order granted for the 
mere asking without assigning special reasons, and 
that too without even granting opportunity to the 
appellant to contest the maintainability of the writ 
petition and failure to notice the subsequent 
developments in the interregnum. The opinion of the 
Division Bench that the counter-affidavit having 
subsequently been filed, stay/modification could be 
 
5 (2018) 1 SCC 626 : 2017 INSC 1146 
6 (2018) 3 SCC 85 : 2018 INSC 71 

15 
 
sought of the interim order cannot be considered 
sufficient justification to have declined interference.” 
 
18. The same position was again reiterated by this Court in 
the case of Phoenix ARC Private Limited v. Vishwa Bharati 
Vidya Mandir and Others7. 
19.  Again, in the case of Varimadugu OBI Reddy v. B. 
Sreenivasulu and Others8, after referring to earlier 
judgments, this Court observed thus: 
“34. The order of the Tribunal dated 1-8-2019 was 
an 
appealable 
order 
under 
Section 
18 
of 
the SARFAESI Act, 2002 and in the ordinary course of 
business, the borrowers/person aggrieved was 
supposed to avail the statutory remedy of appeal 
which the law provides under Section 18 of 
the SARFAESI Act, 2002. In the absence of efficacious 
alternative remedy being availed, there was no 
reasonable justification tendered by the respondent 
borrowers in approaching the High Court and filing 
writ application assailing order of the Tribunal dated 
1-8-2019 under its jurisdiction under Article 226 of 
the Constitution without exhausting the statutory 
right of appeal available at its command.” 
 
20. It could thus be seen that this Court has strongly 
deprecated the practice of entertaining writ petitions in such 
matters. 
 
7 (2022) 5 SCC 345 : 2022 INSC 44 
8 (2023) 2 SCC 168 : 2022 INSC 1205 

16 
 
21. Recently, in the case of Celir LLP (supra), after surveying 
various judgments of this Court, the Court observed thus: 
“101. More than a decade back, this Court had 
expressed serious concern despite its repeated 
pronouncements in regard to the High Courts 
ignoring the availability of statutory remedies under 
the RDBFI Act and the SARFAESI Act and exercise of 
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. 
Even after, the decision of this Court in Satyawati 
Tondon [United Bank of India v. Satyawati Tondon, 
(2010) 8 SCC 110 : (2010) 3 SCC (Civ) 260] , it 
appears that the High Courts have continued to 
exercise its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 
ignoring the statutory remedies under the RDBFI Act 
and the SARFAESI Act.” 
 
 
22. It can thus be seen that it is more than a settled legal 
position of law that in such matters, the High Court should 
not entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution 
particularly when an alternative statutory remedy is available. 
23. The only reasoning that could be seen from the impugned 
order given by the learned Division Bench of the High Court is 
as under: 
“11. It is true that under Section 18 of the SARFAESI 
Act, petitioner has the alternative remedy against the 
impugned order by filing appeal before the appellate 
Tribunal. However, having regard to the fact that the 
writ petition is pending before this Court for quite 
some time and also considering the fact that if the 
impugned order is allowed to stand, petitioner would 
be left without a remedy to ventilate his grievance, we 

17 
 
deem it fit and proper not to non-suit the petitioner 
on the ground of not availing the alternative remedy. 
12. Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act provides that any 
person including a borrower who is aggrieved by the 
action of secured creditor under Section 13 (4) of the 
SARFAESI Act may file an application thereunder.  
Supreme Court has held time and again that the 
Tribunal exercises wide jurisdiction under Section 17 
of the SARFAESI Act, even to the extent of setting 
aside an auction sale.  In the instant case, we are 
consciously not referring to the merit of the case.  All 
that we are concerned is whether for whatever reason 
a person who is aggrieved in law should be left 
remediless. In the instant case, petitioner had 
invoked 
his 
remedy 
by 
filing 
securitization 
application under sub-section (1) of Section 17 of the 
SARFAESI Act.  The application was pending for 
three years before the Tribunal. From the docket 
order dated 21.09.2020, we find that a junior counsel 
appearing on behalf of the petitioner had reported 
that the matter was settled out of Court and 
therefore, leave was sought for withdrawing the 
securitization application which was accordingly 
granted.  
13. When the settlement did not materialize, 
petitioner went back to the Tribunal for revival of the 
securitization 
application 
which 
was 
however 
dismissed on the ground that version of the petition 
did not deserve acceptance.  
14. On thorough consideration of the matter we are 
of the view that dismissal of the miscellaneous 
application of the petitioner by the Tribunal dies not 
appear to be justified. 
15. Though subsequent developments may have a 
bearing on the grant of ultimate relief to a litigant but 
the same by itself cannot denude the adjudicating 
authority of its power to adjudicate the grievance 
raised by the aggrieved person which it otherwise 
possess.” 
  

18 
 
24. It can thus clearly be seen that though it was specifically 
contended on behalf of the appellant herein that the writ 
petition was not maintainable on account of availability of 
alternative remedy, the High Court has interfered with the writ 
petition only on the ground that the matter was pending for 
sometime before it and if the petition was not entertained, the 
Borrower would be left remediless.  We however find that the 
High Court has failed to take into consideration the conduct of 
the Borrower.  It is further to be noted that, though the High 
Court had been specifically informed that, on account of 
subsequent developments, that is confirmation of sale and 
registration thereof, the position had reached an irreversible 
stage, the High Court has failed to take into consideration 
those aspects of the matter.   
25. This Court, in the case of Valji Khimji and Company v. 
Official Liquidator of Hindustan Nitro Product (Gujarat) 
Limited and Others9, has observed thus: 
“30. In the first case mentioned above i.e. where the 
auction is not subject to confirmation by any 
authority, the auction is complete on the fall of the 
hammer, and certain rights accrue in favour of the 
auction-purchaser. However, where the auction is 
subject to subsequent confirmation by some 
 
9 (2008) 9 SCC 299 : 2008 INSC 925 

19 
 
authority (under a statute or terms of the auction) 
the auction is not complete and no rights accrue until 
the sale is confirmed by the said authority. Once, 
however, the sale is confirmed by that authority, 
certain rights accrue in favour of the auction-
purchaser, and these rights cannot be extinguished 
except in exceptional cases such as fraud. 
31. In the present case, the auction having been 
confirmed on 30-7-2003 by the Court it cannot be set 
aside unless some fraud or collusion has been 
proved. We are satisfied that no fraud or collusion 
has been established by anyone in this case.” 
 
 
26. In our view, the High Court ought to have taken into 
consideration that the confirmed auction sale could have been 
interfered with only when there was a fraud or collusion.  The 
present case was not a case of fraud or collusion.  The effect 
of the order of the High Court would be again reopening the 
issues which have achieved finality. 
27. It is further to be noted that this Court, in the case of 
Dwarika Prasad v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others10, 
has clearly held that the right of redemption stands 
extinguished on the execution of the registered sale deed.  In 
the present case, the sale was confirmed on 2nd November 
2020 and registered on 11th November 2020. 
 
10 (2018) 5 SCC 491 : 2018 INSC 210 

20 
 
28. Insofar as the contention of the Borrower and its reliance 
on the judgment of this Court in the case of Mohammad Nooh 
(supra) is concerned, no doubt that non-exercise of 
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution on the 
ground of availability of an alternative remedy is a rule of self-
restraint. There cannot be any doubt with that proposition. In 
this respect, it will be relevant to refer to the following 
observations of this Court in the case of Commissioner of 
Income Tax and Others v. Chhabil Dass Agarwal11: 
“15. Thus, while it can be said that this Court has 
recognised some exceptions to the rule of alternative 
remedy i.e. where the statutory authority has not 
acted in accordance with the provisions of the 
enactment in question, or in defiance of the 
fundamental principles of judicial procedure, or has 
resorted to invoke the provisions which are repealed, 
or when an order has been passed in total violation 
of the principles of natural justice, the proposition 
laid down in Thansingh Nathmal case [AIR 1964 SC 
1419] , Titaghur Paper Mills case [Titaghur Paper Mills 
Co. Ltd. v. State of Orissa, (1983) 2 SCC 433 : 1983 
SCC (Tax) 131] and other similar judgments that the 
High Court will not entertain a petition under Article 
226 of the Constitution if an effective alternative 
remedy is available to the aggrieved person or the 
statute under which the action complained of has 
been taken itself contains a mechanism for redressal 
of grievance still holds the field. Therefore, when a 
statutory forum is created by law for redressal of 
grievances, a writ petition should not be entertained 
ignoring the statutory dispensation.”

29. It could thus clearly be seen that the Court has carved 
out certain exceptions when a petition under Article 226 of the 
Constitution could be entertained in spite of availability of an 
alternative remedy.  Some of them are thus: 
(i) 
where the statutory authority has not acted in 
accordance with the provisions of the enactment in 
question; 
(ii) 
it has acted in defiance of the fundamental principles 
of judicial procedure;  
(iii) it has resorted to invoke the provisions which are 
repealed; and 
(iv) 
when an order has been passed in total violation of the 
principles of natural justice. 
 
30. It has however been clarified that the High Court will not 
entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution if an 
effective alternative remedy is available to the aggrieved person 
or the statute under which the action complained of has been 
taken itself contains a mechanism for redressal of grievance.

31. Undisputedly, the present case would not come under 
any of the exceptions as carved out by this Court in the case 
of Chhabil Dass Agarwal (supra). 
32. We are therefore of the considered view that the High 
Court has grossly erred in entertaining and allowing the 
petition under Article 226 of the Constitution.  
33. While dismissing the writ petition, we will have to remind 
the High Courts of the following words of this Court in the case 
of Satyawati Tondon (supra) since we have come across 
various matters wherein the High Courts have been 
entertaining petitions arising out of the DRT Act and the 
SARFAESI Act in spite of availability of an effective alternative 
remedy: 
“55. It is a matter of serious concern that despite 
repeated pronouncement of this Court, the High 
Courts continue to ignore the availability of statutory 
remedies under the DRT Act and the SARFAESI Act 
and exercise jurisdiction under Article 226 for 
passing orders which have serious adverse impact on 
the right of banks and other financial institutions to 
recover their dues. We hope and trust that in future 
the High Courts will exercise their discretion in such 
matters 
with 
greater 
caution, 
care 
and 
circumspection.”

34. In the result, we pass the following order: 
(i) 
The appeal is allowed; 
(ii) 
The impugned order dated 4th February 2022 passed 
by the High Court in Writ Petition No. 5275 of 2021 is 
quashed and set aside; and 
(iii) Writ Petition No. 5275 of 2021 is dismissed with costs 
quantified at Rs.1,00,000/- imposed upon the 
Borrower. 
35. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
