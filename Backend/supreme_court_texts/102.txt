1.
The short question in this appeal is whether the election petition
filed against the appellant by the first respondent herein was liable to be
rejected at the threshold? The High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam answered
this question in the negative, prompting the appellant to come before us.
2.
Having heard the appeal in part on 18.01.2024, we stayed further
proceedings in the election petition.

3.
The appellant and the six respondents herein contested in the
election to the 15th Kerala Legislative Assembly, held on 06.04.2021, from
081-Tripunithura  Legislative  Assembly  Constituency.  The  appellant  was
declared elected on 02.05.2021, having polled 992 votes more than the
next candidate, viz., the first respondent. Thereupon, Election Petition No.
8 of 2021 was filed by the first respondent before the High Court of Kerala
at Ernakulam under Sections 80, 81, 83, 84, 100, 101 and 123 of the
Representation of the People Act, 1951 (for brevity, ‘the Act of 1951’),
seeking a declaration that the election of the appellant was void and, in
consequence, to declare him duly elected. 
4.
The appellant filed preliminary objections in the election petition.
Therein, he contended that the petition was liable to be dismissed under
Section 86 of the Act of 1951 for non-compliance with Section 81 thereof.
He claimed that a complete election petition, after the curing of defects,
was placed before the Court beyond the period of limitation and, further,
sufficient number of copies, as required under Rule 212 of the Rules of the
High Court of Kerala, 1971 (for brevity, ‘the Rules of 1971’), were not filed.
He also claimed that the copy of the election petition furnished to him was
not a true copy of the petition filed.

5.
The second ground urged by the appellant in his objections was in
relation to Section 83 of the Act of 1951, which requires an election petition
to contain a concise statement of material facts and full particulars of any
corrupt  practice,  including  the  names  of  the  parties  alleged  to  have
committed  such  corrupt  practice  along  with  the  date  and  place  of
commission  of  each  such  practice.  The  appellant  asserted  that  the
pleadings in the election petition lacked material facts and particulars of the
corrupt practices attributed to him and, therefore, the election petition did
not disclose a cause of action. He prayed that the election petition be
dismissed at the threshold under Order VII Rule 11 CPC. 
6.
By the impugned order dated 29.03.2023, a learned Judge of the
High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam accepted the plea of the appellant to
some extent but ultimately found that sufficient cause of action was made
out for trial of the election petition to decide whether the election of the
appellant on 06.04.2021 was null and void. The learned Judge accordingly
held that the election petition would be proceeded with in respect of the
identified issue alone and granted time to the respondents in the election
petition to file their objections/further objections, if any.
7.
Perusal of the impugned order reflects that the learned Judge was
of the opinion that the defects pointed out by the appellant were not in
3

relation to Section 81(3) of the Act of 1951 but pertained only to Rule 212 of
the Rules of 1971. The learned Judge, therefore, held that the lapses in
that regard did not amount to non-compliance with Section 81(3) of the Act
of 1951 and the election petition was not liable to be rejected by invoking
the provisions of Section 86(1) thereof.
8.
Further, upon considering precedents on the issue, the learned
Judge held that the statements allegedly made by the appellant and his
election agents did not amount to a corrupt practice, as defined in Sections
123(2)(a)(ii) and 123(3) of the Act of 1951. However, apropos the allegation
that the appellant had used a religious symbol to further his prospects in
the election and thereby committed a corrupt practice within the sweep of
Section 123(3) of the Act of 1951, the learned Judge found that the slips
distributed by the appellant and his election agents depicted a picture of
Lord Ayyappa and voiced an appeal to vote for the appellant. Thereupon,
the learned Judge opined,  prima facie, that use of the picture of Lord
Ayyappa  in  the  slips  distributed  by  and  on  behalf  of  the  appellant
constitutes a corrupt practice under Section 123(3) of the Act of 1951 and
that the election petition, with respect to this aspect, was liable to be tried.
9.
Aggrieved by the aforestated order, the appellant filed the present
case. In his grounds, he raised mainly two issues. He contended that the
4

election petition was not in compliance with Section 83 (sic 81) of the Act of
1951, as sufficient number of copies of the petition were not filed at the
time of its presentation. He further stated that copies of the documents
served on the respondents in the election petition were not true copies and
had not been attested as true copies. According to him, the defects pointed
out in the election petition were not cured within time and were rectified
after expiry of the period of limitation prescribed for filing of an election
petition.  He  reiterated  his  plea  that  the  election  petition,  filed  without
complying with statutory provisions, was liable to be rejected summarily. He
again asserted that the election petition was lacking in material facts and
particulars. According to him, facts relating to printing and publishing of the
slips with the religious symbol were not furnished to the extent required and
the  election  petition  also  did  not  disclose  the  source  of  information
regarding distribution of such slips by and on behalf of the appellant. He,
therefore, prayed for rejection of the election petition on these grounds.
10.
We may first take note of the relevant provisions in the Act of
1951. Section 86 is the first provision in Chapter III of the Act of 1951, titled
‘Trial of Election Petitions’. Section 86(1) alone is relevant for the purposes
of this case and it reads thus: -
5

‘86. Trial of election petitions.-
(1) The High Court shall dismiss an election petition which does
not comply with the provisions of section 81 or section 82 or
section 117.’
 In turn, Section 81(3), which is presently pertinent, falling in Chapter
II of the Act of 1951, titled ‘Presentation of Election Petitions to High Court’,
reads thus: -
‘81. Presentation of petitions.-
(1)…..
(2)…..
(3)  Every election petition shall be accompanied by as many
copies  thereof  as  there  are  respondents  mentioned  in  the
petition and every such copy shall be attested by the petitioner
under his own signature to be a true copy of the petition…..’
  Section 83, falling in the same Chapter, deals with the contents of
an election petition and, to the extent relevant, it is extracted hereunder: -
‘83. Contents of Petition.- 
(1) An election petition—
(a) shall contain a concise statement of the material facts on
which the petitioner relies;
(b) shall set forth full particulars of any corrupt practice that
the petitioner alleges including as full a statement as possible
of the names of the parties alleged to have committed such
corrupt practice and the date and place of the commission of
each such practice; and
(c)…….’

11.
Before us, arguments were advanced only upon non-compliance
with Section 81(3) of the Act of 1951, warranting invocation of Section 86(1)
thereof, and not on the other issue regarding lack of material facts and
particulars in the pleadings, as required by Section 83 of the Act of 1951. In
any event, it is well settled that non-compliance with the requirements of
Section 83 of the Act of 1951 is not fatal, as Section 86(1) thereof only
speaks of non-compliance with Sections 81, 82 or 117 being the basis for
dismissal of an election petition at the outset. Defects in an election petition
that constitute non-compliance with Section 83 of the Act of 1951 have
been held to be curable defects (See T. Phungzathang vs. Hangkhanlian
and  others1;
 Umesh  Challiyill  vs.  K.P.  Rajendran2;
 Ponnala
Lakshmaiah vs. Kommuri Pratap Reddy and others3; G.M. Siddeshwar
vs. Prasanna Kumar4; and A. Manju vs. Prajwal Revanna alias Prajwal R
and others5). Further, once the High Court opined that a triable issue
under Section 123(3) of the Act of 1951 is made out, we find no grounds to
interfere therewith. 
12.
As regards the appellant’s primary ground, i.e., non-compliance
with the requirements of Section 81(3)  of the  Act  of  1951,  warranting

peremptory rejection of the election petition, it may be noted that it was
never  the  case  of  the  appellant  that  the  election  petition  was  not
accompanied by as many copies as there were respondents in the petition.
His complaint was that sufficient number of authenticated copies were not
furnished as required under Rule 212 of the Rules of 1971. This Rule is
contained in Chapter XVI of the Rules of 1971, titled ‘Election Petitions’.
Rule 212, to the extent relevant, reads as follows: -
‘212. Copies of petitions etc., to be furnished.-
(1)  Every  petition  shall  be  accompanied  by  3  authenticated
copies of the application for the use of the court and twice the
number of additional copies as there are respondents to be
produced  along  with  the  application  for  service  along  with
summons as per rules 210 and 211…….’
13.
It is obvious from a plain reading of the aforestated Rule that the
three authenticated copies are for the use of the Court only. Further, copies
of petitions to be furnished under this Rule are clearly in addition to what is
required to be filed under Section 81(3) of the Act of 1951. Though the
appellant also made a bald statement in his preliminary objections that the
copy of the petition furnished to him was not a true copy of the election
petition, he did not elaborate on what he meant by that. More importantly, a
specific allegation was never made by him that the copy of the petition
8

furnished to him was not attested by the first respondent under his own
signature to be a true copy of the election petition. 
14.
In his grounds in the present case, the appellant stated that copies
of the documents served on the respondents in the election petition were
not true copies and had not been attested as such. However, a precise
averment was not made by the appellant even before us that the copy of
the petition supplied to him was not attested by the first respondent under
his own signature to be a true copy of the election petition. Significantly, the
copy of the petition furnished to him was neither produced before the High
Court nor before us to substantiate this plea. In effect, the only point urged
by the appellant is that the election petition is liable to be rejected for
non-compliance with the requirement of Rule 212 of the Rules of 1971. 
15.
Though it has been argued before us that the requirements of Rule
212 of the Rules of 1971 must be imported into and combined with those
prescribed by Section 81(3) of the Act of 1951, we are not impressed.
When the statutory provision unequivocally stipulates as to what is required
to be done to comply with the mandate thereof, it is not permissible in law
to read something more into that provision. Rule 212 of the Rules of 1971
introduces additional requirements prescribed by the High Court and the
9

same cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be read into and be made part
and parcel of Section 81(3) of the Act of 1951. 
16.
Viewed thus, the objections raised by the appellant against the
maintainability of the election petition filed by the first respondent had no
merit and the order of the High Court holding to that effect warrants no
interference. 
The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
Interim order dated 18.01.2024 shall stand vacated.
Pending miscellaneous application(s) shall stand dismissed.
Parties shall bear their own costs.
