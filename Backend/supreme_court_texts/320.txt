1. 
These appeals take exception to the separate impugned 
judgments and orders dated 7th October 2021 and 29th 
October 2021 passed by the National Company Law Appellate 
Tribunal (for short, ‘the NCLAT’).  In Civil Appeal no.1143 of 
2022, the issue involved is whether the first respondent is a 
financial creditor within the meaning of sub-section (7) of 
Section 5 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (for 
short, ‘the IBC’).  The corporate debtor, in this case, is M/s. 
Mount Shivalik Industries Limited.  The impugned judgment 
and order dated 7th October 2021 holds that the first 
respondent is a financial creditor.  As far as Civil Appeal 
nos.6991-6994 of 2022 are concerned, the issue is whether

the 1st to 4th respondents therein are financial creditors of the 
same corporate debtor - M/s. Mount Shivalik Industries 
Limited.  The impugned judgment dated 29th October 2021 
follows the impugned judgment in Civil Appeal no.1143 of 
2022. 
FACTUAL ASPECTS 
2. 
A brief reference to the factual aspects of Civil Appeal 
no.1143 of 2022 must be made to understand the 
controversy.  There were two agreements of 1st April 2014 and 
1st April 2015 between the corporate debtor and the first 
respondent.  The agreements were in the form of letters 
addressed by the corporate debtor to the first respondent.  By 
the agreement/letter dated 1st April 2014, the corporate 
debtor appointed the first respondent as a ‘Sales Promoter’ to 
promote beer manufactured by the corporate debtor at Ranchi 
(Jharkhand) for twelve months.  One of the conditions 
incorporated 
by 
the 
corporate 
debtor 
in 
the 
said 
letter/agreement was that the first respondent should deposit 
a minimum security of Rs.53,15,000/- with the corporate 
debtor, which will carry interest @21% per annum.  The letter 
provided that the corporate debtor will pay the interest on 
Rs.7,85,850/- @21% per annum.  The terms of the 
agreement/letter dated 1st April 2015 are identical.  The only 
difference is that under the second agreement/letter, the 
corporate debtor was to pay the interest on Rs.32,85,850/- 
@21% per annum. 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.

3. 
The Oriental Bank of Commerce invoked the provisions 
of Section 7 of the IBC against the corporate debtor.  The 
National Company Law Tribunal (for short, ‘the NCLT’) 
admitted the application under Section 7 of the IBC by the 
order dated 12th June 2018. It imposed a moratorium under 
Section 14 of the IBC.  The second respondent was appointed 
as the Interim Resolution Professional.  Initially, the first 
respondent filed a claim with the second respondent as an 
operational creditor.  The claim was withdrawn, and on 19th 
September 2018, the first respondent filed a claim with the 
second 
respondent 
as 
a 
financial 
creditor. 
 
By 
a 
communication 
dated 
7th 
October 
2018, 
the 
second 
respondent informed the first respondent that the first 
respondent's claim was accepted partly as an operational debt 
and partly as a financial debt.  After the first respondent 
submitted Form-B, the second respondent rejected the claim 
on the ground that the first respondent could not be 
considered a financial creditor.  Therefore, an application was 
moved before the NCLT under sub-section (5) of Section 60 of 
the IBC by the first respondent seeking a direction to the 
second respondent to admit the first respondent's claim as a 
financial creditor.  During the pendency of the said 
application before the NCLT, the Committee of Creditors 
approved a resolution plan submitted by M/s. Kals Distilleries 
Pvt. Ltd. The second respondent applied to the NCLT to 
approve the resolution plan based on the approval.  On 18th 
January 2021, the NCLT rejected the application made by the 
first respondent.  Aggrieved by the said order, the first 
respondent preferred an appeal before the NCLAT.  By the 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 4 of 33 
impugned judgment and order dated 7th October 2021, the 
NCLAT held that the first respondent was a financial creditor 
and not an operational creditor.  The NCLT, on 13th October 
2021 approved the resolution plan of M/s. Kals Distilleries 
Pvt. Ltd. (Respondent no.6 in Civil Appeal nos.6991-6994 of 
2022) in the CIRP of the corporate debtor.   
4. 
In Civil Appeal nos.6991-6994 of 2022, the second 
respondent is the resolution professional.  The corporate 
debtor is the same as in the other appeal.  The fifth 
respondent had provided financial assistance to the corporate 
debtor of Rs.75,00,000/-.  The fourth respondent provided 
financial 
assistance 
to 
the 
corporate 
debtor 
of 
Rs.1,62,00,000/-. The first respondent advanced a sum of 
Rs.25,00,000/- to the corporate debtor. The third respondent 
advanced a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- to the corporate debtor.  
The Resolution Professional rejected the claims of the four 
creditors as financial creditors.  Therefore, they filed separate 
applications before the NCLT by invoking sub-section (5) of 
Section 60 of the IBC.  The NCLT rejected the applications.  In 
the appeals preferred by them before the NCLAT, the NCLAT 
allowed the appeals by relying upon its judgment, which is 
the subject matter of challenge in Civil Appeal no.1143 of 
2022. 
SUBMISSIONS 
5. 
The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants 
in support of Civil Appeal no. 1143 of 2022 submitted that 
the first respondent is an operational creditor going by the 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 5 of 33 
agreements dated 1st April 2014 and 1st April 2015.  The 
reason is that the agreements indicate that the corporate 
debtor appointed the first respondent to render services to 
promote the beer manufactured by the corporate debtor.  He 
relied upon the definition of “operational debt” under sub-
section (21) of Section 5 of the IBC.  He submitted that both 
the agreements provided for paying a minimum security 
deposit by the first respondent as a condition for being 
appointed as Sales Promoter of the corporate debtor.  He 
submitted that there was no intention on the part of the 
corporate debtor to avail any financial facility from the first 
respondent.  He submitted that the amount paid towards the 
security deposit is not the money disbursed to the corporate 
debtor towards financial facilities availed by the corporate 
debtor.  He submitted that the security deposit paid by the 
first respondent would not qualify as a financial debt defined 
under sub-section (8) of Section 5 of the IBC.  The learned 
senior counsel relied upon a decision of this Court in the case 
of Swiss Ribbons Private Limited and Anr. v. Union of 
India & Ors.1.  He also relied upon a decision of this Court in 
the case of Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd. & 
Anr. v. Union of India & Ors.2.  He submitted that the 
NCLAT was unnecessarily impressed by the acknowledgement 
of liability and booking of interest component towards the 
security deposit, despite the fact that it cannot be given the 
overriding effect over the law.  He relied upon the decisions of 
this Court in the cases of Tuticorin Alkali Chemicals & 
 
1  (2019) 4 SCC 17 
2  (2019) 8 SCC 416 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 6 of 33 
Fertilisers Ltd., Madras v. Commissioner of Income Tax, 
Madras3 and Consolidated Construction Consortium 
Limited v. Hitro Energy Solutions Private Limited4.  He 
submitted that booking or payment of interest is not the only 
criterion for ascertaining whether the debt is a financial debt.  
The learned senior counsel, therefore, urged that the view 
taken by the NCLAT in the impugned judgment is entirely 
fallacious.  He submitted that the NCLAT has virtually 
rewritten the concepts of financial and operational debts 
incorporated in the IBC. 
6. 
On facts, the learned senior counsel submitted that the 
payment of the security deposit by the first respondent is a 
condition precedent for being appointed as a Sales Promoter 
of the corporate debtor.  The intent of the agreements is to 
appoint the first respondent as the Sales Promoter and not to 
avail any financial facilities from the first respondent.  The 
amount paid by the first respondent does not constitute 
financial facilities extended to the corporate debtor. There was 
no intention to raise finance from the first respondent, who 
was appointed as a Sales Promoter.  The learned senior 
counsel also relied upon the decisions of this court in the 
cases of Anuj Jain, Interim Resolution Professional for 
Jaypee Infratech Limited v. Axis Bank Limited & Ors.5, 
Phoenix ARC Private Limited v. Spade Financial Services 
Limited & Ors.6 and New Okhla Industrial Development 
 
3  (1997) 6 SCC 117 
4  (2022) 7 SCC 164 
5  (2020) 8 SCC 401 
6  (2021) 3 SCC 475 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 7 of 33 
Authority v. Anand Sonbhadra7.  Lastly, it is submitted 
that in the case of an invoice involving any transaction, the 
delay in payment attracts interest liability.  Therefore, the 
payment of interest is not the sole criterion for ascertaining 
whether a debt is a financial debt.  He would, thus, submit 
that the appeals deserve to be allowed. 
7. 
The learned senior counsel appearing for the first 
respondent submitted that the true nature of the agreements 
will have to be examined for deciding the nature of the debt.  
He pointed out several factual aspects, including the 
corporate debtor's acknowledgement of the liability of 
payment of interest on security deposit for the Financial Years 
2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.  The 
corporate debtor deducted TDS on the interest payable to the 
first respondent for three financial years.  He submitted that 
the three criteria, namely, disbursal, time value of money and 
commercial effect of borrowing, are satisfied in the case of the 
present transaction.  He also relied upon the decision of this 
Court in the case of Anuj Jain, Interim Resolution 
Professional for Jaypee Infratech Limited5.  He submitted 
that it was very clear from the terms of the agreement that the 
money was repayable after a fixed tenure without a deduction 
or provision for forfeiture.  An interest @21% per annum was 
the consideration for the time value of money.  The learned 
counsel submitted that the NCLAT was right in going into the 
issue of the true nature and effect of the transaction reflected 
in the agreements.  Relying upon the decision of this Court in 
 
7  (2023) 1 SCC 724 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 8 of 33 
the case of Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd2, 
the learned counsel submitted that clause (f) of sub-section 
(8) of Section 5 of the IBC is a “catch all” and “residuary” 
provision 
which 
includes 
any 
transaction 
having 
the 
commercial effect of borrowing and any transaction which is 
used as a tool for raising finance. 
8. 
The 
learned 
senior 
counsel 
submitted 
that 
the 
agreements entered into were the tools for raising finance, 
and no actual services have ever been rendered to the first 
respondent or other lenders.  Therefore, in view of the law laid 
down by this Court in the case of V.E.A. Annamalai 
Chettiar & Ors. v. S.V.V.S. Veerappa Chettiar & Ors.8, the 
true 
effect 
of 
the 
transaction 
has 
been 
taken 
into 
consideration.  It is pointed out that the corporate debtor has 
established a practice of raising finance through private 
entities in the garb of security deposit under various services 
agreements.  The learned counsel, therefore, submitted that 
no fault can be found with the impugned judgment.  
9. 
The 
learned 
counsel 
appearing 
for 
the 
second 
respondent-Resolution Professional, supported the appellants 
by contending that the money advanced by the first 
respondent cannot be categorised as a financial debt.  
Therefore, the first respondent was an operational creditor.  
He relied upon the definition of “operational debt” under sub-
section (21) of Section 5 of the IBC.  He submitted that the 
security deposit was not meant to reorganize the corporate 
 
8  AIR 1956 SC 12 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 9 of 33 
debtor's debts.  He submitted that the agreements are service 
agreements by which the corporate debtor agreed to take 
services 
from 
the 
first 
respondent 
for 
consideration.  
Therefore, the security deposit was obviously to ensure the 
performance of the terms of the agreements by the first 
respondent.  He submitted that accounting treatment cannot 
override the law and the definition of “operational debt” under 
the IBC.  He submitted that none of the ingredients of clauses 
(a) to (f) of sub-section (8) of Section 5 are present in the case 
at hand.  In this case, there is no disbursal of debt.  He 
submitted that there was no financial contract between the 
corporate debtor and the first respondent.  Lastly, he 
submitted that in view of the judgment dated 29th September 
2018 of the NCLAT on an application filed by M/s. New View 
Consultants Pvt. Ltd., the second respondent categorised the 
first respondent as operational creditor.  He would, therefore, 
submit that the view taken by the NCLAT was not correct. 
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS ON THE CONCEPT OF 
FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DEBT 
10. 
Sub-section (11) of Section 3 of the IBC defines ‘debt’, 
which reads thus: 
“3. In this Code, unless the context 
otherwise requires,- 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
.. ..  
(11) 
“debt” 
means 
a 
liability 
or 
obligation in respect of a claim which is 
due from any person and includes a 
financial debt and operational debt; 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 10 of 33 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
.. .” 
Thus, a debt has to be a liability or obligation in respect of a 
claim that is due from any person.  Sub-section (11) uses the 
words “means” and “includes”. Financial debt and operational 
debt are included in the definition of debt. Thus, financial 
debt or operational debt must arise out of a liability or 
obligation in respect of a claim.   
11. 
“Claim” is defined under sub-section (6) of Section 3 of 
the IBC, which reads thus: 
“3. In this Code, unless the context 
otherwise requires,- 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
.. .. . 
(6) “claim” means –  
(a) a right to payment, whether or 
not 
such 
right 
is 
reduced 
to 
judgment, 
fixed, 
disputed, 
undisputed, 
legal, 
equitable, 
secured, or unsecured;  
(b) right to remedy for breach of 
contract under any law for the time 
being in force, if such breach gives 
rise to a right to payment, whether 
or not such right is reduced to 
judgment, 
fixed, 
matured, 
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, 
secured or unsecured; 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
.. .” 
Clause (a) shows that every right to receive payment is a 
claim, whether or not such right is reduced to a judgment.  A 
right to receive payment is a claim, even if disputed, 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 11 of 33 
undisputed, secured, or unsecured.  The right to receive 
payment can be either legal or equitable.  Clause (b) includes 
the right to remedy for a breach of contract under any law for 
the time being in force. Thus, a liability or obligation is not 
covered by the definition of “debt” unless it is in respect of a 
claim covered by sub-section (6) of Section 3 of the IBC.   
12. 
Sub-section (8) of Section 5 of the IBC defines “financial 
debt”, which reads thus: 
“5. In this Part, unless the context 
otherwise requires,- 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
.. ..  
(8) “financial debt” means a debt 
alongwith interest, if any, which is 
disbursed against the consideration 
for the time value of money and 
includes–  
(a) 
money 
borrowed 
against 
the 
payment of interest;  
(b) any amount raised by acceptance 
under any acceptance credit facility or 
its dematerialised equivalent;  
(c) any amount raised pursuant to any 
note purchase facility or the issue of 
bonds, notes, debentures, loan stock or 
any similar instrument;  
(d) the amount of any liability in respect 
of any lease or hire purchase contract 
which is deemed as a finance or capital 
lease under the Indian Accounting 
Standards or such other accounting 
standards as may be prescribed;  

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 12 of 33 
(e) receivables sold or discounted other 
than any receivables sold on non-
recourse basis;  
(f) any amount raised under any 
other 
transaction, 
including 
any 
forward sale or purchase agreement, 
having the commercial effect of a 
borrowing; 
[Explanation. -For the purposes of this 
sub-clause,- 
(i) any amount raised from an 
allottee under a real estate 
project shall be deemed to be 
an 
amount 
having 
the 
commercial 
effect 
of 
a 
borrowing; and 
(ii) the expressions, “allottee” 
and “real estate project” shall 
have the meanings respectively 
assigned to them in clauses (d) 
and (zn) of section 2 of the Real 
Estate 
(Regulation 
and 
Development) Act, 2016 (16 of 
2016);]  
(g) any derivative transaction entered 
into in connection with protection 
against or benefit from fluctuation in 
any rate or price and for calculating the 
value of any derivative transaction, only 
the market value of such transaction 
shall be taken into account;  
(h) any counter-indemnity obligation in 
respect of a guarantee, indemnity, 
bond, documentary letter of credit or 
any other instrument issued by a bank 
or financial institution;  

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 13 of 33 
(i) the amount of any liability in respect 
of any of the guarantee or indemnity for 
any of the items referred to in sub-
clause (a) to (h) of this clause.” 
(emphasis added)  
The definition incorporates the expression “means and 
includes”.  The first part of the definition, which starts with 
the word “means”, provides that there has to be a debt along 
with interest, if any, which is disbursed against the 
consideration for the time value of money.  The word “and” 
appears after the word “money”.  Before the words “and 
includes”, the legislature has not incorporated a comma.  
After the word “includes”, the legislature has incorporated 
categories (a) to (i) of financial debts.  Hence, the cases 
covered by categories (a) to (i) must satisfy the test laid down 
by the earlier part of the sub-section (8).  The test laid down 
therein is that there has to be a debt along with interest, if 
any, and it must be disbursed against the consideration for 
the time value of money. This Court had an occasion to deal 
with the definition of “financial debt” in its various decisions.  
The first decision is in the case of Anuj Jain, Interim 
Resolution Professional for Jaypee Infratech Limited5.  
Paragraphs 46 to 50 read thus: 
“The essentials for financial debt and 
financial creditor 
46. Applying 
the 
aforementioned 
fundamental principles to the definition 
occurring in Section 5(8) of the Code, 
we have not an iota of doubt that for a 
debt to become “financial debt” for the 
purpose of Part II of the Code, the basic 
elements are that it ought to be a 
disbursal against the consideration for 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 14 of 33 
time value of money. It may include any 
of the methods for raising money or 
incurring 
liability 
by 
the 
modes 
prescribed in clauses (a) to (f) of Section 
5(8); it may also include any derivative 
transaction 
or 
counter-indemnity 
obligation as per clauses (g) and (h) of 
Section 5(8); and it may also be the 
amount of any liability in respect of any 
of the guarantee or indemnity for any of 
the items referred to in clauses (a) to 
(h). The requirement of existence of a 
debt, which is disbursed against the 
consideration for the time value of 
money, in our view, remains an 
essential part even in respect of any 
of the transactions/dealings stated 
in clauses (a) to (i) of Section 5(8), 
even if it is not necessarily stated 
therein. In any case, the definition, by 
its very frame, cannot be read so 
expansive, rather infinitely wide, that 
the 
root 
requirements 
of 
“disbursement” 
against 
“the 
consideration for the time value of 
money” could be forsaken in the 
manner that any transaction could 
stand alone to become a financial debt. 
In 
other 
words, 
any 
of 
the 
transactions 
stated 
in 
the 
said 
clauses (a) to (i) of Section 5(8) would 
be 
falling 
within 
the 
ambit 
of 
“financial debt” only if it carries the 
essential elements stated in the 
principal clause or at least has the 
features which could be traced to 
such 
essential 
elements 
in 
the 
principal clause. In yet other words, 
the essential element of disbursal, 
and 
that 
too 
against 
the 
consideration 
for 
time 
value 
of 
money, needs to be found in the 
genesis of any debt before it may be 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 15 of 33 
treated as “financial debt” within the 
meaning of Section 5(8) of the Code. 
This debt may be of any nature but a 
part of it is always required to be 
carrying, or corresponding to, or at 
least having some traces of disbursal 
against consideration for the time value 
of money. 
47. As noticed, the root requirement for 
a creditor to become financial creditor 
for the purpose of Part II of the Code, 
there must be a financial debt which is 
owed to that person. He may be the 
principal creditor to whom the financial 
debt is owed or he may be an assignee 
in terms of extended meaning of this 
definition but, and nevertheless, the 
requirement of existence of a debt being 
owed is not forsaken. 
48. It is also evident that what is being 
dealt with and described in Section 5(7) 
and in Section 5(8) is the transaction 
vis-à-vis 
the 
corporate 
debtor. 
Therefore, for a person to be designated 
as a financial creditor of the corporate 
debtor, it has to be shown that the 
corporate debtor owes a financial debt 
to such person. Understood this way, it 
becomes clear that a third party to 
whom the corporate debtor does not 
owe a financial debt cannot become its 
financial creditor for the purpose of 
Part II of the Code. 
49. Expounding yet further, in our 
view, the peculiar elements of these 
expressions “financial creditor” and 
“financial 
debt”, 
as 
occurring 
in 
Sections 5(7) and 5(8), when visualised 
and 
compared 
with 
the 
generic 
expressions 
“creditor” 
and 
“debt” 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 16 of 33 
respectively, as occurring in Sections 
3(10) and 3(11) of the Code, the scheme 
of 
things 
envisaged 
by 
the 
Code 
becomes clearer. The generic term 
“creditor” is defined to mean any person 
to whom the debt is owed and then, it 
has also been made clear that it 
includes 
a 
“financial 
creditor”, 
a 
“secured 
creditor”, 
an 
“unsecured 
creditor”, an “operational creditor”, and 
a “decree-holder”. Similarly, a “debt” 
means a liability or obligation in respect 
of a claim which is due from any person 
and this expression has also been given 
an extended meaning to include a 
“financial debt” and an “operational 
debt”. 
49.1. The 
use 
of 
the 
expression 
“means 
and 
includes” 
in 
these 
clauses, on the very same principles 
of interpretation as indicated above, 
makes it clear that for a person to 
become a creditor, there has to be a 
debt i.e. a liability or obligation in 
respect of a claim which may be due 
from any person. A “secured creditor” 
in terms of Section 3(30) means a 
creditor in whose favour a security 
interest 
is 
created; 
and 
“security 
interest”, in terms of Section 3(31), 
means a right, title or interest or claim 
of property created in favour of or 
provided for a secured creditor by a 
transaction which secures payment for 
the purpose of an obligation and it 
includes, amongst others, a mortgage. 
Thus, any mortgage created in favour of 
a creditor leads to a security interest 
being created and thereby, the creditor 
becomes a secured creditor. However, 
when all the defining clauses are read 
together and harmoniously, it is clear 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.

that the legislature has maintained a 
distinction amongst the expressions 
“financial 
creditor”, 
“operational 
creditor”, 
“secured 
creditor” 
and 
“unsecured creditor”. Every secured 
creditor would be a creditor; and every 
financial creditor would also be a 
creditor but every secured creditor may 
not be a financial creditor. As noticed, 
the expressions “financial debt” and 
“financial creditor”, having their specific 
and distinct connotations and roles in 
insolvency and liquidation process of 
corporate persons, have only been 
defined 
in 
Part 
II 
whereas 
the 
expressions 
“secured 
creditor” 
and 
“security interest” are defined in Part I. 
50. A conjoint reading of the statutory 
provisions with the enunciation of this 
Court in Swiss Ribbons [Swiss Ribbons 
(P) Ltd. v. Union of India, (2019) 4 SCC 
17] , leaves nothing to doubt that in the 
scheme of the IBC, what is intended by 
the expression “financial creditor” is a 
person who has direct engagement in 
the functioning of the corporate debtor; 
who 
is 
involved 
right 
from 
the 
beginning while assessing the viability 
of the corporate debtor; who would 
engage in restructuring of the loan as 
well 
as 
in 
reorganisation 
of 
the 
corporate debtor's business when there 
is financial stress. In other words, the 
financial creditor, by its own direct 
involvement in a functional existence of 
corporate 
debtor, 
acquires 
unique 
position, who could be entrusted with 
the task of ensuring the sustenance 
and growth of the corporate debtor, 
akin to that of a guardian. In the 
context 
of 
insolvency 
resolution 
process, this class of stakeholders, 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 18 of 33 
namely, financial creditors, is entrusted 
by the legislature with such a role that 
it would look forward to ensure that the 
corporate debtor is rejuvenated and 
gets back to its wheels with reasonable 
capacity of repaying its debts and to 
attend 
on 
its 
other 
obligations. 
Protection of the rights of all other 
stakeholders, including other creditors, 
would obviously be concomitant of such 
resurgence of the corporate debtor. 
50.1. Keeping the objectives of the 
Code in view, the position and role of a 
person having only security interest 
over the assets of the corporate debtor 
could easily be contrasted with the role 
of a financial creditor because the 
former shall have only the interest of 
realising the value of its security (there 
being no other stakes involved and 
least 
any 
stake 
in 
the 
corporate 
debtor's growth or equitable liquidation) 
while the latter would, apart from 
looking 
at 
safeguards 
of 
its 
own 
interests, 
would 
also 
and 
simultaneously 
be 
interested 
in 
rejuvenation, revival and growth of the 
corporate debtor. Thus understood, it is 
clear that if the former i.e. a person 
having only security interest over the 
assets of the corporate debtor is also 
included as a financial creditor and 
thereby allowed to have its say in the 
processes contemplated by Part II of the 
Code, the growth and revival of the 
corporate debtor may be the casualty. 
Such result would defeat the very 
objective and purpose of the Code, 
particularly of the provisions aimed at 
corporate insolvency resolution. 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 19 of 33 
50.2. Therefore, we have no hesitation 
in saying that a person having only 
security interest over the assets of 
corporate debtor (like the instant third-
party securities), even if falling within 
the description of “secured creditor” by 
virtue of collateral security extended by 
the 
corporate 
debtor, 
would 
nevertheless stand outside the sect of 
“financial 
creditors” 
as 
per 
the 
definitions contained in sub-sections (7) 
and (8) of Section 5 of the Code. 
Differently put, if a corporate debtor 
has given its property in mortgage to 
secure the debts of a third party, it may 
lead to a mortgage debt and, therefore, 
it may fall within the definition of “debt” 
under Section 3(10) of the Code. 
However, it would remain a debt alone 
and cannot partake the character of a 
“financial debt” within the meaning of 
Section 5(8) of the Code.” 
 (emphasis added) 
A Bench of three Hon’ble Judges of this Court in the case of 
Phoenix ARC Private Limited6 dealt with the issue in greater 
detail.  It also dealt with the concept of the time value of 
money.  In paragraphs 44 to 47 of the said decision, this 
Court held thus: 
“44. Section 
5(8) 
IBC 
provides 
a 
definition of “financial debt” in the 
following terms: 
XXX 
XXX XXX 
G.3.2. Financial 
creditor 
and 
financial debt 
45. Under Section 5(7) IBC, a person 
can be categorised as a financial 
creditor if a financial debt is owed to it. 
Section 5(8) IBC stipulates that the 
essential ingredient of a financial debt 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 20 of 33 
is disbursal against consideration for 
the time value of money. This Court, 
speaking through Rohinton F. Nariman, 
J., in Swiss Ribbons (P) Ltd. v. Union of 
India [Swiss Ribbons (P) Ltd. v. Union 
of India, (2019) 4 SCC 17] has held : 
(SCC p. 64, para 42) 
“42. A perusal of the definition of 
“financial creditor” and “financial 
debt” makes it clear that a 
financial debt is a debt together 
with interest, if any, which is 
disbursed 
against 
the 
consideration for time value of 
money. It may further be money 
that is borrowed or raised in any 
of the manners prescribed in 
Section 5(8) or otherwise, as 
Section 
5(8) 
is 
an 
inclusive 
definition. On the other hand, an 
“operational debt” would include 
a 
claim 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
provision of goods or services, 
including employment, or a debt 
in respect of payment of dues 
arising 
under 
any 
law 
and 
payable to the Government or 
any local authority.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
46. In this context, it would be relevant 
to discuss the meaning of the terms 
“disburse” and “time value of money” 
used in the principal clause of Section 
5(8) IBC. This Court has interpreted the 
term “disbursal” in Pioneer Urban Land 
& 
Infrastructure 
Ltd. v. Union 
of 
India [Pioneer 
Urban 
Land 
& 
Infrastructure Ltd. v. Union of India, 
(2019) 8 SCC 416 : (2019) 4 SCC (Civ) 
1] in the following terms : (SCC p. 511, 
paras 70-71) 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 21 of 33 
“70. The definition of “financial 
debt” in Section 5(8) then goes on 
to state that a “debt” must be 
“disbursed” 
against 
the 
consideration for time value of 
money. “Disbursement” is defined 
in Black's 
Law 
Dictionary (10th 
Edn.) to mean: 
‘1. The act of paying out money, 
commonly from a fund or in 
settlement of a debt or account 
payable. 2. The money so paid; an 
amount of money given for a 
particular purpose.’ 
71. In the present context, it is clear 
that the expression “disburse” would 
refer to the payment of instalments by 
the allottee to the real estate developer 
for the particular purpose of funding 
the real estate project in which the 
allottee 
is 
to 
be 
allotted 
a 
flat/apartment. The 
expression 
“disbursed” refers to money which has 
been paid against consideration for the 
“time value of money”. In short, the 
“disbursal” must be money and must 
be against consideration for the “time 
value of money”, meaning thereby, the 
fact that such money is now no longer 
with the lender, but is with the 
borrower, who then utilises the money.” 
  
47. The report of the Insolvency Law 
Committee 
dated 
26-3-2018 
has 
discussed the interpretation of the term 
“time value of money” and stated: 
“1.4. The current definition of 
“financial debt” under Section 
5(8) of the Code uses the words 
“ [Ed. : The matter between two 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 22 of 33 
asterisks has been emphasised 
in original.] includes [Ed. : The 
matter between two asterisks 
has 
been 
emphasised 
in 
original.] ”, thus the kinds of 
financial debts illustrated are 
not exhaustive. The phrase “ 
[Ed. : The matter between two 
asterisks has been emphasised 
in original.] disbursed against 
the consideration for the time 
value of money [Ed. : The matter 
between two asterisks has been 
emphasised in original.] ” has 
been 
the 
subject 
of 
interpretation only in a handful 
of cases under the Code. The 
words “time value” have been 
interpreted 
to 
mean 
compensation or the price 
paid for the length of time for 
which the money has been 
disbursed. This may be in the 
form of interest paid on the 
money, 
or 
factoring 
of 
a 
discount in the payment.” 
(emphasis added)” 
In the case of Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd. 
& Anr2, this issue was dealt with in paragraphs 76 and 77, 
which read thus: 
“76. Sub-clause (f) Section 5(8) thus 
read 
would 
subsume 
within 
it 
amounts raised under transactions 
which 
are 
not 
necessarily 
loan 
transactions, so long as they have 
the commercial effect of a borrowing. 
We were referred to Collins English 
Dictionary 
& 
Thesaurus (2nd 
Edn., 
2000) for the meaning of the expression 
“borrow” and the meaning of the 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 23 of 33 
expression “commercial”. They are set 
out hereinbelow: 
“borrow.—vb 1. to obtain or 
receive 
(something, 
such 
as 
money) on loan for temporary 
use, intending to give it, or 
something equivalent back to the 
lender. 2. to adopt (ideas, words, 
etc.) 
from 
another 
source; 
appropriate. 3. Not standard. to 
lend. 4. (intr) Golf. To putt the 
ball uphill of the direct path to 
the hole:make sure you borrow 
enough.” 
*** 
“commercial.—adj. 
1. 
of 
or 
engaged 
in 
commerce. 
2. 
sponsored or paid for by an 
advertiser: commercial television. 
3. having profit as the main aim: 
commercial 
music. 
4.(of 
chemicals, etc.) unrefined and 
produced in bulk for use in 
industry. 
5. 
a 
commercially 
sponsored 
advertisement 
on 
radio or television.” 
77. A perusal of these definitions would 
show that even though the petitioners 
may 
be 
right 
in 
stating 
that 
a 
“borrowing” is a loan of money for 
temporary use, they are not necessarily 
right in stating that the transaction 
must culminate in money being given 
back to the lender. The expression 
“borrow” is wide enough to include an 
advance given by the homebuyers to a 
real estate developer for “temporary 
use” i.e. for use in the construction 
project so long as it is intended by the 
agreement 
to 
give 
“something 
equivalent” to money back to the 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 24 of 33 
homebuyers. 
The 
“something 
equivalent” 
in 
these 
matters 
is 
obviously the flat/apartment. Also of 
importance 
is 
the 
expression 
“commercial effect”. “Commercial” 
would generally involve transactions 
having profit as their main aim. 
Piecing the threads together, therefore, 
so long as an amount is “raised” under 
a real estate agreement, which is done 
with profit as the main aim, such 
amount would be subsumed within 
Section 5(8)(f) as the sale agreement 
between developer and home buyer 
would have the “commercial effect” of a 
borrowing, in that, money is paid in 
advance for temporary use so that a 
flat/apartment is given back to the 
lender. Both parties have “commercial” 
interests in the same—the real estate 
developer seeking to make a profit on 
the sale of the apartment, and the 
flat/apartment purchaser profiting by 
the 
sale 
of 
the 
apartment. 
Thus 
construed, there can be no difficulty in 
stating that the amounts raised from 
allottees under real estate projects 
would, in fact, be subsumed within 
Section 5(8)(f) even without adverting to 
the Explanation introduced by the 
Amendment Act.” 
(emphasis added) 
FINDINGS ON FACTUAL ASPECTS 
13. 
In light of the interpretation put by this Court to the 
definition of financial debt, it is necessary to come back to the 
facts of the case.  The relevant agreements for our 
consideration are in the form of letters dated 1st April 2014 
and 1st April 2015.  The corporate debtor addressed the 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 25 of 33 
letters to the first respondent.  The relevant part of the 
agreement/letter dated 1st April 2014 reads thus: 
“.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

(emphasis added) 
As seen from clause (4), the agreement was only for twelve 
months ending on 31st March 2015.  Therefore, on 1st April 
2015, another letter was issued by the corporate debtor to the 
first respondent, incorporating identical terms and conditions.  
The only difference is that the agreement's duration was up to 
31st March 2016. Clause (10) of the agreement/letter dated 1st 
April 2015 reads thus: 
“.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

14. 
Where one party owes a debt to another and when the 
creditor is claiming under a written agreement/arrangement 
providing for rendering 'service', the debt is an operational 
debt only if the claim subject matter of the debt has some 
connection or co-relation with the ‘service’ subject matter of 
the transaction. The written document cannot be taken for its 
face value. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the real 
nature of the transaction on a plain reading of the 
agreements.  What is surprising is that for acting as a Sales 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 28 of 33 
Promoter of the beer manufactured by a corporate debtor, 
only a sum of Rs.4,000/- per month was made payable to the 
first respondent.  Apart from the sum of Rs.4,000/- per 
month, there is no commission payable to the first respondent 
on the quantity of sales.  Clause (6) provides for termination 
of the appointment by giving thirty days’ notice.  Though 
clause (10) provides for the payment of the security deposit by 
the first respondent, it is pertinent to note that there is no 
clause for the forfeiture of the security deposit.  The amount 
specified in clause (10) has no correlation whatsoever with the 
performance of the other conditions of the contract by the 
first respondent.  As there is no clause regarding forfeiture of 
the security deposit or part thereof, the corporate debtor was 
liable to refund the security deposit after the period specified 
therein was over with interest @21% per annum.  Since the 
security deposit payment had no correlation with any other 
clause under the agreements, as held by the NCLAT, the 
security deposit amounts represent debts covered by sub-
section (11) of Section 3 of the IBC.  The reason is that the 
right of the first respondent to seek a refund of the security 
deposit with interest is a claim within the meaning of sub-
section (6) of Section 3 of the IBC as the first respondent is 
seeking a right to payment of the deposit amount with 
interest.  Therefore, there is no manner of doubt that there is 
a debt in the form of a security deposit mentioned in the said 
two agreements. 
15. 
Sub-section (21) of Section 5 defines “operational debt”, 
which reads thus: 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 29 of 33 
“5. In this Part, unless the context 
otherwise requires,- 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
.. ..  
(21) “operational debt” means a claim in 
respect of the provision of goods or 
services including employment or a 
debt in respect of the payment of dues 
arising under any law for the time being 
in force and payable to the Central 
Government, any State Government or 
any local authority; 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
.. .” 
The second part of the definition which deals with the 
payment of dues arising under any law, will not apply.  
However, for the applicability of the first part, the claim must 
be concerning the provisions of goods or services.  Therefore, 
in the case of a contract of service, there must be a 
correlation between the service as agreed to be provided 
under the agreement and the claim. The reason is that the 
definition uses the phraseology “a claim in respect of the 
provision of goods or services”.  Assuming that both the 
agreements are genuine in the sense that they reflect the true 
nature of the transaction, the only claim under the 
agreements which will have any connection with the services 
rendered by the first respondent will be the claim of 
Rs.4,000/- per month as provided in clause (1) of both the 
agreements.  Only this claim can be said to be concerning the 
provision of services.  Therefore, by no stretch of imagination, 
the debt claimed by the first respondent can be an operational 
debt. We are conscious of the fact that the provision for 
payment of interest by the corporate debtor by itself is not the 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 30 of 33 
only material factor in deciding the nature of the debt. But, in 
the facts of the case, the payment of the amount mentioned in 
clause (10) of the letter has no relation with the service 
supposed to be rendered by the first respondent.  
16. 
Now, coming back to the definition of a financial debt 
under sub-section (8) of Section 5 of the IBC, in the facts of 
the case, there is no doubt that there is a debt with interest 
@21% per annum.  The provision made for interest payment 
shows that it represents consideration for the time value of 
money.  Now, we come to clause (f) of sub-section (8) of 
Section 5 of the IBC.  The first condition of applicability of 
clause (f) is that the amount must be raised under any other 
transaction.  Any other transaction means a transaction 
which is not covered by clauses (a) to (e).  Clause (f) covers all 
those transactions not covered by any of these sub-clauses of 
sub-section (8) that satisfy the test in the first part of Section 
8.  The condition for the applicability of clause (f) is that the 
transaction must have the commercial effect of borrowing.  
“Transaction” has been defined in sub-section (33) of Section 
3 of the IBC, which includes an agreement or arrangement in 
writing for the transfer of assets, funds, goods, etc., from or to 
the corporate debtor.  In this case, there is an arrangement in 
writing for the transfer of funds to the corporate debtor.  
Therefore, the first condition incorporated in clause (f) is 
fulfilled.   
17. 
To decide whether the second condition had been 
fulfilled, it is necessary to refer to the factual findings 
recorded in the impugned judgment.  The NCLAT has referred 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 31 of 33 
to the letter dated 26th October 2017 addressed by the 
corporate debtor to the first respondent. We have perused a 
copy of the said letter annexed to the counter. By the said 
letter, the corporate debtor informed the first respondent that 
for the year 2016-2017, the corporate debtor had provided the 
interest amounting to Rs.18,06,000/- in the books of the 
corporate debtor and that the sum will be credited to the 
account of the first respondent on the date of payment of 
TDS.  In paragraph 21 of the impugned judgment, it is held 
that the financial statement of the first respondent for the 
Financial Year 2017-2018 shows revenue from the interest on 
the security deposit.  It is also held that the amounts were 
treated as long-term loans and advances in the financial 
statement of the corporate debtor for the Financial Year 2015-
2016.  Moreover, in the financial statement of the corporate 
debtor for the Financial Year 2016-17, the amounts paid by 
the first respondent were shown as “other long-term 
liabilities”.  Therefore, if the letter mentioned above and the 
financial statements of the corporate debtor are considered, it 
is evident that the amount raised under the said two 
agreements has the commercial effect of borrowing as the 
corporate debtor treated the said amount as borrowed from 
the first respondent. 
CONCLUSION 
18. 
Therefore, we have no hesitation in concurring with the 
NCLAT's view that the amounts covered by security deposits 
under the agreements constitute financial debt. As it is a 
financial debt owed by the first respondent, sub-section (7) of 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 32 of 33 
Section 5 of the IBC makes the first respondent a financial 
creditor. 
19. 
The contracts subject matter of the Civil Appeal Nos. 
6991 to 6994 of 2022 are in the form of letters, which provide 
for similar clauses as in the case of agreements subject 
matter of Civil Appeal No. 1143 of 2022.  
SUMMARY 
20. 
Subject to what is held above, we summarize our legal 
conclusions:  
a. There cannot be a debt within the meaning of sub-
section (11) of section 5 of the IB Code unless there 
is a claim within the meaning of sub-section (6) of 
section 5 of thereof; 
b. The test to determine whether a debt is a financial 
debt within the meaning of sub-section (8) of 
section 5 is the existence of a debt along with 
interest, if any, which is disbursed against the 
consideration for the time value of money. The 
cases covered by categories (a) to (i) of sub-section 
(8) must satisfy the said test laid down by the 
earlier part of sub-section (8) of section 5; 
c. While deciding the issue of whether a debt is a 
financial debt or an operational debt arising out of 
a 
transaction 
covered 
by 
an 
agreement 
or 
arrangement in writing, it is necessary to ascertain 

Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022 etc.  
 
 
 
    Page 33 of 33 
what is the real nature of the transaction reflected 
in the writing; and 
d. Where one party owes a debt to another and when 
the creditor is claiming under a written agreement/ 
arrangement providing for rendering 'service', the 
debt is an operational debt only if the claim subject 
matter of the debt has some connection or co-
relation with the ‘service’ subject matter of the 
transaction. 
OPERATIVE PART 
21. 
For the reasons recorded earlier, we hold that the view 
taken by the NCLAT under the impugned judgments and
