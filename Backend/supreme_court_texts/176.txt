1. 
This appeal arises against the judgment and order 
passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi at 
New Delhi on 12th October, 2015 in Criminal Appeal No.287 
of 2015, thereby dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant 
herein. 
2. 
The facts in brief leading to the filing of the present 
appeal are as under: 
2.1 Deceased-Meena, daughter of Mani Ram (PW.3) and 
Gyanwati (PW.6), got married to the appellant-Ravinder 
Kumar (accused No.1) on 20.06.1999.  A male child named

Reason:
Signature Not Verified

 
2 
Harry was born out of the said wedlock on 26.08.2000.  On 
27.04.2001, at 0055 hours, a First Information Report (“FIR” 
for short) bearing No.129/2001 (Ext. PW-9/A) was registered 
at the instance of deceased-Meena in the Police Station Civil 
Lines, Delhi for investigation into the offence under Section 
498-A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short. ‘IPC’). In the 
said FIR, deceased-Meena made allegations with regard to 
cruelty made by her husband-Ravinder Kumar (accused 
No.1) and his two brothers, namely, Pushpender Singh 
(accused No.2) and R. Harshinder (accused No.4) during her 
stay at the matrimonial home at H.No.252, Old Chandrawal, 
Civil Line, Delhi.  In the said FIR, after completion of the 
investigation a Report under Section 173 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, ‘Cr.P.C’) was submitted.  
However, it appears that there was a compromise between 
the 
parties 
and 
she 
made a 
statement 
before 
the 
Metropolitan Magistrate (Mahila Court), Delhi that she does 
not want to proceed with the case any further.   She further 
stated that she has no grievance against the accused persons 
and that the complaint had been made by her out of 
frustration and anger.  She had also stated that she was 

 
3 
living separately with her husband and child happily, as 
such criminal proceedings were terminated and the accused 
were discharged vide judgment dated 21.10.2003. 
2.2 On the morning of 29.05.2004, dead body of Meena was 
discovered at about 0820 hours lying in a pool of blood on 
the floor of the room on the ground floor, her throat slit with 
a sharp edged weapon and her son Harry aged about three 
and a half years was found sitting nearby. 
2.3 The FIR No.211/04 (Ext. PW-1/A) came to be registered 
for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC on the 
basis of rukka (Ex.PW-15/B) sent by Sub Inspector Ram 
Chander (PW.15).  The FIR was later converted into a case 
involving for offence punishable under Section 304-B/498-
A/34 of the IPC on the basis of the statements made by Mani 
Ram (PW.3), Shiv Kumar (PW.4) and Gyanwati (PW.6), father, 
brother and mother of deceased Meena respectively. 
2.4 On conclusion of the investigation, charges were framed 
against Ravinder Kumar (accused No.1), the husband of the 
deceased, Babu Lal (accused No.4), who is the father-in-law  
of the deceased, Phoolwati (accused No.3), who is the mother-
in-law of the deceased and Pushpender (accused No.2) and R. 

 
4 
Harshinder (accused No.5), who are the brothers-in-law of 
the deceased.  At the conclusion of the trial, by judgment and 
order dated 25.11.2014/08.01.2015, the Addl. Sessions 
Judge-02, North District, Rohini Courts, Delhi (hereinafter 
referred to as “trial court”) convicted the appellant herein for 
the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC and sentenced 
him to undergo life imprisonment with a fine of Rs.25,000/-.  
All the accused were sentenced to undergo rigorous 
imprisonment for ten years with fine of Rs.20,000/- for the 
offences punishable under Section 304B/34 IPC and rigorous 
imprisonment for three years with fine of Rs.25,000/- each 
for offence under Section 498A/34 IPC with further direction 
that in case of default in payment of fine they would undergo 
rigorous imprisonment for six months and three months 
respectively. 
2.5 Being aggrieved thereby, two criminal appeals came to 
be preferred by the convicted persons.  Mani Ram (PW.3), the 
father of the deceased also filed an independent appeal being 
Criminal Appeal No.569 of 2015, being aggrieved by the 
acquittal of accused Nos.2 to 5 for the offences punishable 
under Section 302/34 IPC. The appeals were heard together.  

 
5 
The High Court, vide impugned judgment and order dated 
12th October 2015, held the appellant herein and Pushpender 
(accused No.2) guilty for the offence punishable under 
Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC.  The conviction and 
sentence of the appellant herein and Pushpender (accused 
No.2) was set aside for the offence punishable under Section 
304B read with Section 34 IPC while maintaining the 
sentence awarded by the trial court to the appellant for the 
offence punishable under Section 302/34 IPC.  The High 
Court also sentenced Pushpinder (accused No.2) to undergo 
life imprisonment with fine of Rs.25,000/- for the offence 
punishable under Section 302/34 IPC.  In case of default in 
payment of fine, he was directed to undergo rigorous 
imprisonment for three months.  The conviction of Phoolwati 
(accused No.3), Babu Lal (accused No.4) and R. Harshinder 
(accused No.5) for the offence punishable under Section 304-
B read with Section 34 IPC and conviction of all accused for 
offence under Section 498-A read with Section 34 IPC and 
sentences awarded thereagainst were maintained. 
2.6 Babu Lal (accused No.4), who is the father-in-law  of the 
deceased had preferred Criminal Appeal No.2025 of 2017 

 
6 
before this Court.  Since Phoolwati (accused No.3), who is the 
mother-in-law of the deceased died during the pendency of 
the appeal, the appeal came to be abated against her. In the 
said appeal, insofar as Babu Lal (accused No.4) is concerned, 
though this Court did not find any ground to interfere with 
the conviction passed by the trial court and the High Court, 
it reduced the sentence for the period already undergone by 
accused No.4-Babu Lal. 
2.7 Pushpender (accused No.2) had preferred Criminal 
Appeal Nos.938-939 of 2016.  This Court, vide order dated 
15th February 2022 partly allowed the appeals and set aside 
the conviction and sentence recorded against Pushpender 
(accused No.2) for offence punishable under Section 302 IPC, 
however it restored the conviction and sentence in respect of 
offences under Sections 304B and 498A read with Section 34 
IPC. 
2.8 Insofar as R. Harshinder (accused No.5) is concerned, 
he had preferred Criminal Appeal No.244 of 2022.  His 
appeal was also partly allowed by reducing the sentence to 
the period already undergone by him, vide order dated 15th 
February 2022. 

 
7 
2.9 After the aforesaid appeals were decided, the appellant 
herein has preferred the present appeal in October, 2023.  
Leave was granted in this matter on 13.02.2024. 
3. 
We have heard Ms. Neha Kapoor, learned counsel for 
the appellant and Mr. Rajan Kumar Chourasia, learned 
counsel for the respondent. 
4. 
Ms. Kapoor submits that the conviction is based on 
circumstantial evidence. She further submits that no 
incriminating circumstances have been proved against the 
appellant beyond reasonable doubt.  She submits that 
insofar as recovery of the bloodstained clothes is concerned, 
it is found at a place accessible to one and all and she 
further submits that the recovery panchnama also does not 
mention the date of recovery.  She therefore submits that, the 
conviction under Section 302 IPC is not at all tenable. 
5. 
Ms. Kapoor further submits that even the conviction 
under Section 304B and 498A would not be tenable. She 
submits that the matter was compromised between the 
deceased and the accused.  It is submitted that taking into 
consideration the above aspect, the amended charge came to 
be framed on 14.03.2007, restricting the claim with regard to 

 
8 
cruelty only for the period between 21.10.2003 and 
29.05.2004 i.e. from the date of the discharge by the learned 
Magistrate in the earlier proceedings till the date on which 
Meena was found dead.  Ms. Kapoor further submits that 
during this period there is no allegation against the appellant 
herein, which would attract the provisions of Section 498A 
IPC.  It is submitted that the prosecution fails to prove the 
guilt.  The conviction under Section 304B IPC would also not 
be tenable. 
6. 
Shri 
Rajan 
Kumar 
Chourasia, 
learned 
counsel 
appearing for the respondent, on the contrary, submits that 
both the Courts, upon correct appreciation of evidence, have 
concurrently found the appellant herein guilty for the offence 
punishable under Section 302 IPC.  It is, therefore, 
submitted that no interference is warranted with the 
conviction recorded under Section 302 IPC.  It is submitted 
that insofar as conviction under Section 498A and 304B IPC 
are concerned, the same has been affirmed by this Court in 
the case of three co-accused persons, as such the said 
finding has attained finality. 
7. 
With the assistance of the learned counsel for the 

 
9 
parties, we have scrutinized the evidence. 
8. 
Undoubtedly, the case of the prosecution rests on 
circumstantial evidence.  The law with regard to conviction 
on the basis of circumstantial evidence has very well been 
crystalized in the judgment of this Court in the case of 
Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra1, 
wherein this Court held thus: 
“152. Before discussing the cases relied upon by 
the High Court we would like to cite a few decisions 
on the nature, character and essential proof 
required in a criminal case which rests on 
circumstantial 
evidence 
alone. 
The 
most 
fundamental and basic decision of this Court is 
Hanumant v. State of Madhya Pradesh [(1952) 2 
SCC 71 : AIR 1952 SC 343 : 1952 SCR 1091 : 1953 
Cri LJ 129] . This case has been uniformly followed 
and applied by this Court in a large number of later 
decisions up-to-date, for instance, the cases of 
Tufail (Alias) Simmi v. State of Uttar Pradesh [(1969) 
3 SCC 198 : 1970 SCC (Cri) 55] and Ramgopal v. 
State of Maharashtra [(1972) 4 SCC 625 : AIR 1972 
SC 656] . It may be useful to extract what Mahajan, 
J. has laid down in Hanumant case [(1952) 2 SCC 
71 : AIR 1952 SC 343 : 1952 SCR 1091 : 1953 Cri 
LJ 129] : 
“It is well to remember that in cases 
where the evidence is of a circumstantial 
nature, the circumstances from which 
the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn 
should in the first instance be fully 
established, 
and 
all 
the 
facts 
so 
established should be consistent only 
 
1(1984) 4 SCC 116 : 1984 INSC 121 

 
10 
with the hypothesis of the guilt of the 
accused. 
Again, 
the 
circumstances 
should be of a conclusive nature and 
tendency and they should be such as to 
exclude every hypothesis but the one 
proposed to be proved. In other words, 
there must be a chain of evidence so far 
complete as not to leave any reasonable 
ground for a conclusion consistent with 
the innocence of the accused and it must 
be such as to show that within all human 
probability the act must have been done 
by the accused.” 
 
153. A close analysis of this decision would show 
that the following conditions must be fulfilled before 
a case against an accused can be said to be fully 
established: 
(1) the circumstances from which the 
conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should 
be fully established. 
It may be noted here that this Court indicated that 
the circumstances concerned “must or should” and 
not “may be” established. There is not only a 
grammatical but a legal distinction between “may be 
proved” and “must be or should be proved” as was 
held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. 
State of Maharashtra [(1973) 2 SCC 793 : 1973 SCC 
(Cri) 1033 : 1973 Crl LJ 1783] where the 
observations were made: [SCC para 19, p. 807: SCC 
(Cri) p. 1047] 
“Certainly, it is a primary principle that 
the accused must be and not merely may 
be guilty before a court can convict and 
the mental distance between ‘may be’ and 
‘must be’ is long and divides vague 
conjectures from sure conclusions.” 
(2) the facts so established should be 
consistent only with the hypothesis of the 
guilt of the accused, that is to say, they 

 
11 
should not be explainable on any other 
hypothesis except that the accused is 
guilty, 
(3) the circumstances should be of a 
conclusive nature and tendency, 
(4) they should exclude every possible 
hypothesis except the one to be proved, 
and 
(5) there must be a chain of evidence so 
complete as not to leave any reasonable 
ground for the conclusion consistent with 
the innocence of the accused and must 
show that in all human probability the 
act must have been done by the accused. 
 
154. These five golden principles, if we may say so, 
constitute the panchsheel of the proof of a case 
based on circumstantial evidence.” 
 
9. 
It can thus clearly be seen that it is necessary for the 
prosecution 
that 
the 
circumstances 
from 
which 
the 
conclusion of the guilt is to be drawn should be fully 
established.  The Court holds that it is a primary principle 
that the accused ‘must be’ and not merely ‘may be’ guilty 
before a court can convict the accused. It has been held that 
there is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction 
between ‘may be proved’ and ‘must be or should be proved’.  
It has been held that the facts so established should be 
consistent only with the guilt of the accused, that is to say, 

 
12 
they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis 
except that the accused is guilty.  It has further been held 
that the circumstances should be such that they exclude 
every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved.  It has 
been held that there must be a chain of evidence so complete 
as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion 
consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show 
that in all human probabilities the act must have been done 
by the accused.  
10. It is settled law that the suspicion, however strong it 
may be, cannot take the place of proof beyond reasonable 
doubt.  An accused cannot be convicted on the ground of 
suspicion, no matter how strong it is. An accused is 
presumed to be innocent unless proved guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt.   
11. In the light of the aforesaid judgment, we have 
examined the present case.  In the present case, the trial 
court and the High Court have basically convicted and 
affirmed the conviction under Section 302 IPC, finding the 
plea of the alibi to be without substance.  It is a settled 
proposition of law that before the burden shifts on the 

 
13 
accused under Section 106 of the Evidence Act, the 
prosecution will have to prove its case.  No doubt that in view 
of the law laid down by this Court in the case of Trimukh 
Maroti Kirkan v. State of Maharashtra2, which is a case 
like the present one, where husband and wife reside together 
in a house and the crime is committed inside the house, it 
will be for the husband to explain how the death occurred in 
the house where they cohabited together.  However, even in 
such a case, the prosecution will have to first establish that 
before the death occurred, the deceased and the accused 
were seen in the said house. In the present case, the incident 
had occurred on the intervening night of 28th/29th May, 
2004. It was necessary for the prosecution to lead some 
evidence to establish that on the night of 28th/29th May 2004, 
deceased and accused were together in the house. This will 
be more necessary in view of the specific plea of the defence 
of alibi. 
12. We will have to consider as to whether the prosecution 
has established other circumstances beyond reasonable 
doubts, which led to no other conclusion than the guilt of the 
 
2 (2006) 10 SCC 681 : 2006 INSC 691 

 
14 
accused. 
13. The prosecution has relied upon the CDRs with regard 
to mobile phone of the Saroj, Pushpender (accused No.2) and 
Ravinder Kumar (accused No.1).  However, both the Courts 
found the said evidence to be inadmissible as it was not 
proved in terms of Section 65A of the Evidence Act.  The 
circumstances relied upon by the prosecution is with regard 
to the seizure of the bloodstained clothes allegedly used by 
the appellant at the time of commission of the crime beneath 
the double bed from his parental home at Chandrawal.  We 
find that the said recovery cannot be relied for more than one 
reasons.  For a recovery to be admissible on the statement 
made under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, it has to be from 
such a place which is exclusively within the knowledge of the 
maker thereof.  Indisputably, the recovery is from a place 
accessible to one and all and the recovery panchnama also 
does not mention the date regarding such a recovery.  Apart 
from that, there is no entry in malkhana register with regard 
to the deposit of the said articles and sending them to the 
FSL for chemical examination. We, therefore, find that the 
said circumstances cannot be said to be proved beyond 

 
15 
reasonable doubt.   
14. Apart from that, the prosecution has not been in a 
position to prove any other circumstance beyond reasonable 
doubt. The trial court and the High Court have heavily relied 
on the circumstance that an English calendar (Ex. PX) was 
found to be hanged in the room.  On one side, two sheets of 
paper both similar computer print outs has been pasted.   On 
one of the sheets, on the left top corner, the name Ravinder 
followed by mobile telephone number 9818419048 preceded 
by a drawing of mobile phone with arrow sign, all written in 
hand can be noticed.  On the other sheet pasted on the top, 
above the calendar, it was printed thus:- 
 
“In-Laws: 2791 3334 
 
Self: 9818419048  
My Home: 55153285” 
 
15. It has been held that the appellant had hung calendar 
(Ex.PX) on the wall of the house, where he was residing and 
the calendar (Ex.PX) would catch the attention of anybody 
entering the house.  It was held that it was deliberate and 
had an objective.  It was also held that Chandrawal house 
was qualified by the expression “my home” and the house 

 
16 
where the other phone was functional as that of his “in-
laws”.   The High Court observed thus:-  
“...The phone number of Chandrawal house was 
qualified by the expression “my home” and the 
house where the other   phone (27913334) was 
functional as that of his “In-laws” 
 
16. With this finding and coupled with the finding that in 
the house the appellant has created a scene so as to make it 
seem like a robbery, it was held that it was only the appellant 
who was guilty for commission of murder of his wife.  
17. We are of the considered view that the High Court has 
failed to draw a distinction between the “may have committed 
the crime” or “must have committed the crime”, as held by 
this Court in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda 
(supra).  As held by this Court, the suspicion, however strong 
it may be, cannot take the place of proof beyond reasonable 
doubt.  We, therefore, find that the prosecution has failed to 
prove any incrimination circumstance beyond reasonable 
doubt and in any case failed to establish a chain of events 
intertwined with each other, which leads to no other 
conclusion than the guilt of the accused.  

 
17 
18. Considering the facts and circumstances, the appeal is 
partly allowed and the conviction and sentence imposed 
upon the appellant herein for the offence punishable under 
Section 302 IPC is set aside.  However, the conviction and 
sentence in respect of the offences punishable under 
Sections 304B, 498A read with Section 34 IPC are restored. 
19. In the present case, the appellant has undergone 
incarceration for a period of more than fifteen years.  In that 
view of the matter, we direct that it will not be necessary for 
the appellant to deposit the fine amount. The appellant is 
directed to be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any 
other case. 
20. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
