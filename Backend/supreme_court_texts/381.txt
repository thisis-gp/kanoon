2.
Relevant facts for the sake of convenience are taken from
Civil  Appeal  Nos.  1875-1876  of  2024,  filed  by  the  West
Bengal Board of Primary Education [hereinafter referred to
as ‘Board’].
FACTUAL MATRIX
3.
The origin of the  dispute  lies  in the  Board’s  Notification
dated 23.12.2020 for filling up 16,500 vacancies of primary
school teachers with a qualification criterion of possessing
the  minimum  NCTE-prescribed  training  qualification  and
having  qualified  the  Teacher  Eligibility  Test  2014
[hereinafter referred to as ‘TET-2014’]. Thereafter, a Merit
List  for  15,284  candidates  was  notified  on  15.02.2021.
Subsequently, two more Merit Lists were published, covering
all the 16,500 vacancies that were notified by the Board. As
per the  West Bengal Primary School Teachers Recruitment
2

Rules, 2016 [hereinafter referred to as ‘Recruitment Rules,
2016’], the said panel of candidates was then sent across to
the respective District Primary School Councils (‘appointing
authority’ under  S. 5 of Recruitment Rules 2016) to make
appointments therefrom.
4.
At  that  shape,  a  few  candidates  who  had  not  yet  been
appointed  approached  the  Calcutta  High  Court  seeking
directions that the Board fill up the remaining vacant seats
by reducing cut-off marks in each category. After the unfilled
vacancies  were reconciled,  the  learned Single  Judge  vide
order  dated  26.09.2022  directed  that  the  252  Writ
Petitioners be granted appointments against these unfilled
3929 vacancies. Subsequently, the Board notified the filling
up of a fresh set of 11,765 vacancies for primary school
teachers vide Notification dated 21.10.2022, considering the
candidature from TET-2014 as well as TET-2017 candidates.
5.
Immediately thereafter, the Board filed an appeal (MAT No.
1734/2022 & CAN 1/2022) challenging the Single Judge’s
order of 26.09.2022. In dismissing the Board’s appeal, the
Division Bench directed that the balance 3929 vacancies of
3

primary school teachers be treated exclusively as part of the
16,500 vacancies pertaining to TET-2014 candidates only,
for  which  recruitment  process  had  commenced  vide
Notification dated 23.12.2020. 
6.
The  Division  Bench  concluded  that  the  entire  TET-2014
selection as well as the appointment process was fraught
with irregularities. The Merit List contained only ranks of
the candidates without offering their comparative marks. It
was observed that not just the TET-2014 candidates or Writ
Petitioners before the High Court but the Board itself was
not aware of the cut-off mark at which appointments had
ceased.  Marks  were  not  disclosed  to  the  unsuccessful
candidates and they were given only one-line intimation that
they were ‘not included in the present Merit List’. These
features shrouded the entire selection process into deeper
suspicion, thereby further vitiating the appointment process
as opined by the Division Bench.
7.
With this understanding, the Division Bench directed that
the TET-2014 Eligibility List be treated as the Merit List to
determine  inter-se positions  of  the  TET-2014  candidates,
4

including those 252 applicants who had filed Writ Petitions
before the High Court. Consequently, the Single Bench order
dated 26.09.2022 was modified to the effect that the 3929
left over vacancies were extended to all the remaining TET-
2014  candidates,  in  descending  order  of  their  inter-se
positions in the TET Eligibility List 2014, notwithstanding
the fact that these vacancies were carried forward through a
fresh recruitment Notification dated 29.09.2022.
8.
Appeals herein have been filed by the Board & others to
challenge the Division Bench judgment dated 11.11.2022 of
the Calcutta High Court in MAT 1734/2022 and I.A. No.
CAN 1/2022.
SUBMISSIONS
9.
The  primary  contention  of  Mr.  Jaideep  Gupta  and  Ms.
Meenakshi Arora, learned senior counsel, is rooted in the
provisions of the Recruitment Rules, 2016. They would refer
to  the  procedure  of  selection  specified  in  Rule  8  of  the
Recruitment Rules, 2016 to contend that the Merit List is
based  on  evaluation  conducted  on  various  parameters,
following  which  marks  are  awarded  to  candidates.
5

Eventually,  the  Merit  List  is  published  and  thereafter,
appointments are to be made on the basis of marks secured
by the candidates in the evaluation process specified in the
provisions.  However, the directions issued by the Division
Bench in the impugned judgment provide for appointments
to be made on the basis of candidates’ inter-se positions in
the TET Eligibility List 2014, which is in contravention to
the procedure specified under the Recruitment Rules, 2016.
10.
It  is  then  argued  that  the  life  of  the  panel/Merit  List
remains  valid  for  a  period  of  one  year  from  the  date  of
approval by the Board. In this case, since the panel was
notified on 15.02.2021, it naturally expired after one year on
15.02.2022.  In  this  case,  candidates  filed  their  Writ
Petitions only in May 2022 i.e., approximately three months
after the panel had expired. Therefore, no individual could
have claimed any right of appointment in reference to the
particular recruitment process after the panel had expired.
11.
Additionally, Mr. Gupta pointed out that the 3929 vacancies
that  remained  unfilled  due  to  various  factors  were  then
carried forward through a Notification dated 29.09.2022 as
6

part of the fresh recruitment cycle. Under the new process,
9500  appointments  were  already  been  made  from  the
advertised 11,500 vacancies. It would therefore not be fair to
dislodge the appointed candidates either from the previous
or current recruitment cycle.
12.
Appearing for those candidates who seek appointment to the
3929  left-over  vacancies  from  the  initial  pool  of  16,500
vacancies, Dr. Menaka Guruswamy, learned senior counsel
contends that although the validity of the panel as per Rule
12 is one year, there is a provision to extend the validity of
the same by six months at a time but the total period of
such extension cannot exceed one year in any case.
13.
It was argued that the learned Single Judge in WPA No.
8981 of 2022 gave sufficient opportunity to the Board to put
forth  the  relevant  information  pertaining  to  the  entire
recruitment exercise in a transparent manner. Despite many
such  requests,  directions  and  reminders  by  the  Court,
information  was  not  forthcoming  about  the  respective
candidates’ ranks, marks, category, cut-offs, etc. Even when
the  matter  was  posted  for  consideration  on  26.09.2022,
7

these relevant information were not furnished by the Board. 
14.
Finding that the names of the 252 Writ Petitioners in WPA
No. 8981/2022 are figuring in the particulars submitted by
the  Board  in  a  tabular  form,  the  learned  Judge  issued
direction that the 252 Writ Petitioners should be granted
appointments  against  the  unfilled  vacancies  (3929).  The
Division  Bench  likewise  noticed  the  inequities  that  the
candidates had been put through along with the arduous
nature of seeking employment as well as the lack of  bona
fide conduct on the Board’s part. Therefore, left with no
choice  but  to  ignore  the  Merit  List  fraught  with
irregularities,  the  Division  Bench  directed  that  the
appointments be made on the basis of the inter-se positions
of candidates within the TET Eligibility List 2014.
15.
Mr. Vinay Navare, learned senior counsel in his turn pointed
out that the entire recruitment exercise had been done in a
reckless manner with little to no information in the public
domain. Although the Merit List had been notified by the
Board, marks scored by candidates were not put forth as
part of the same. Additionally, even the candidates were not
8

informed of their scores or the cut-off mark to be breached,
to be included in the Merit List. In fact, the Board was not
forthcoming on why 3929 vacancies had remained, why no
written test was conducted and other relevant informations,
pertaining to the recruitment process. In light of the same,
the  counsel  contends  that  the  panel,  being  full  of  such
glaring lapses and errors, was not valid in law and therefore
the panel can’t possibly have an expiry date.
DISCUSSION
16.
As  earlier  noted,  the  recruitment  for  primary  school
teachers is governed by the  Recruitment Rules, 2016. The
Rule 8 provides for the procedure for selection of candidates.
After  a  prima facie scrutiny  of  application  forms  by  the
Selection  Committee,  candidates  are  made  to  undergo  a
round of interview(s) and aptitude test(s). 
17.
Thereafter, an evaluation is done on the basis of marks that
are  awarded  or  computed  as  per  the  criteria.  These  are
extracted here for easy reference:
“8. Procedures of selection: …….  (3) Academic qualifications, training,
performance in the TET, Extra Curricular activities and performance in
viva-voce  or  interview  and  Aptitude  test,  shall  be  computed  in  the
manner as mentioned in Table A below:-

Higher  Secondary,  Madhyamik  Examination  or  its  equivalent
excluding  additional  marks,  if  any,  shall  be  reduced
proportionately to marks obtained out of 10. 
Note 3.- The percentage of marks obtained by the candidate in the
relevant  Teacher  Training  shall  be  reduced  proportionately  to
marks obtained out of 15. 
Note 4.- The percentage of marks obtained by the candidate in the
TET  Examination  shall  be  reduced  proportionately  to  marks
obtained out of 5. 
Note 5.- Marks out of maximum five (5) Marks as mentioned in Sl.

including para teacher, in the following manner:-

Total:
5
18.
The evaluation criteria envisages marks to be awarded on
relevant academic qualifications, NCTE-mandated training,
performance in TET, extra-curricular activities, performance
in the viva-voce and aptitude test to the aspirants. Even
within  the  criteria,  extra-curricular  activities  are  to  be
awarded as per the candidate’s experience in music, arts,
drama, literature, etc.
19.
As specified under the  Recruitment Rules, 2016, the panel
under  Rule  2(l)  of  eligible/selected  candidates  is  to  be
prepared bearing in mind the aggregate of marks provided
in Rule 8(3) and Table A appended thereto. It is clear that
the evaluation criteria to be taken into account as per Table
A and  Rule 8(3) is a far more comprehensive  method of
evaluating a candidate’s suitability  for the post than the
performance  in  TET  i.e.,  a  qualifying  examination  for
teaching  eligibility.  The  impugned  judgment  however
directed  that  appointments  against  the  remaining  3929
vacancies shall be made in a descending order of candidates’
11

respective inter-se positions in TET Eligibility List 2014.
20.
Therefore,  the  manner  of  shortlisting  candidates  for
appointment  as  directed  by  the  Division  Bench  is  at
loggerheads  with  and  in  departure  from  the  procedure
envisaged  under  Rule  8.  Being  inconsistent  with  the
Recruitment  Rules,  2016,  such  a  direction  cannot  be
sustained.
21.
The next issue is whether the remaining 3929 vacancies are
to  be treated  exclusively  as  part of 16,500 vacancies for
which the recruitment process commenced via a Notification
dated 23.12.2020, or whether such vacancies can be carried
forward to the next recruitment cycle that commenced via a
Notification dated 29.09.2022 instead.
22.
Although the first advertisement reflected a total of 16,500
vacancies, the Merit List (notified on 15.02.2021) was only
for 15,284 candidates. Thereafter, two additional Merit Lists
with  478  and  738  candidates  respectively  were  notified
thereby  taking  the  total  count  to  16,500.  During  the
proceedings before the High Court, the learned Single Judge
on  22.02.2021  passed  an  interim  order  staying
12

appointments from the Merit List notified on 15.02.2021.
However,  the  Division Bench by  its  order on 04.03.2021
declared that the Board is bound by the said Merit List
dated 15.02.2021 and permitted appointments to be made
to the 15,284 posts. Thereafter, regular appointments came
to be made.
23.
Since the panel expired after one year under Rule 12 of the
Recruitment  Rules,  2016,  the  Board  issued  a  fresh
advertisement to fill up 11,765 vacancies. It was argued that
the  unfilled vacancies should  be treated  exclusively  as  a
part  of  the  recruitment  process  initiated  through
Notification dated 23.12.2020 and the Court may modify the
Division  Bench  direction  to  the  extent  that  the  3929
vacancies are filled up on the basis of merit determined in
consonance with Rule 8 of the Recruitment Rules, 2016. The
aforementioned argument can be accepted only if a legal
justification is found for the Writ Petitioner’s appointment to
the 16,500 posts.
24.
To better understand whether such a panel can be utilised
for appointment after its expiry and if there exists a legal
13

right  to  be  considered  for  appointments  to  the  notified
16,500 vacancies, it is relevant to take note of the ratio in
the following judgments:
i.
State of Orissa & Anr. v. Raj Kishore Nanda & Ors.1:
“16. A select list cannot be treated as a reservoir for the
purpose of appointments, that vacancy can be filled up
taking the names from that list as and when it is so
required. It is the settled legal proposition that no relief
can be granted to the candidate if he approaches the
court after the expiry of the select list. If the selection
process is over, select list has expired and appointments
had been made, no relief can be granted by the court at
a belated stage.”
ii.
Union of India v. B. Valluvan2:
“17. The life of a panel ordinarily is one year. The same
can be extended only by the State and that too if the
statutory  rule  permits  it  to  do  so.  The  High  Court
ordinarily would not extend the life of a panel. Once a
panel stands exhausted upon filling up of all the posts,
the question of enforcing a future panel would not arise.
It was for the State to accept the said recommendations
of the Selection Committee or reject the same. As has
been noticed hereinbefore, all notified vacancies as also
the vacancy which arose in 2000 had also been filled
up. As the future vacancy had already been filled up in
the  year 2000, the  question  of  referring  back to  the
panel prepared in  the year 1999  did  not arise. The
impugned judgment, therefore, cannot be sustained.”
iii.
Girdhar Kumar Dadhich v. State of Rajasthan3:
“16. Furthermore, the select list would ordinarily remain
valid for one year. We fail to understand on what basis
1 (2010) 6 SCC 777 at 783. Para 16.
2 (2006) 8 SCC 686, Para 17.
3 (2009) 2 SCC 706 at 709, Para 16.
14

appointments  were  made  in  2003  or  subsequently.
Whether the validity of the said select list was extended
or not is not known. Extension of select list must be
done  in  accordance  with  law.  Apart  from  a  bald
statement made in the list of dates that the validity of
the said select list had been extended, no document in
support thereof has been placed before us.”
iv.
State of Bihar v. Mohd. Kalimuddin4:
“8.  As held in the case of Shankarsan Dash [(1991) 3
SCC 47 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 800 : (1991) 17 ATC 95 :
(1991) 2 SCR 567] even if vacancies are notified for
appointment and adequate number of candidates are
found fit, the successful candidates do not acquire an
indefeasible right to be appointed, unless the relevant
rules indicate to the contrary. It is indeed expected of
the  State  to  act  bona  fide  and  for  valid  reasons  in
refusing to make the appointments after the selection
process has been gone through……..
Without knowing the nature of change it was not open to
the High Court to anticipate the policy and brand it as
unreasonable.
9.  For the above reasons, we are of the opinion that
even if it is assumed that the panel or select list had not
expired  at  the  date  of  filing  of the  writ  petition, the
refusal  on  the  part  of  the  Government  to  make
appointments from the panel or select list, vide letter
dated 27-5-1993, could not be condemned as arbitrary,
irrational and or mala fide. We, therefore, reverse the
view taken by the High Court, set it aside and hold that
the original writ petition was liable to be dismissed and
we hereby dismiss the same. No order as to costs.”
25.
The  opinion  expressed  in  the  above  judgments  makes  it
4 (1996) 2 SCC 7 at 12. Paras 8 & 9.
15

clear that a panel or a Merit List cannot be treated as if it
exists  in  perpetuity,  which  will  facilitate  making
appointments  as  and  when  required.  When  the  panel
expires or after the selection process is over with most posts
being filled, the benefit of appointments cannot be given
unless the panel’s validity is legally extended. However, no
such extension of the panel’s validity was granted. In fact, in
conclusion  of  the  earlier  process,  a  fresh  recruitment
process was undertaken vide Notification dated 29.09.2022,
through  which,  9500  candidates  have  already  been
appointed.
26.
That  apart  even  when  vacancies  are  notified  and  an
adequate  number  of  candidates  are  shortlisted,  these
candidates  do  not  acquire  an  indefeasible  right  to  be
appointed against those vacancies. Multiple factors are to be
taken into account by the Board, including suitability as per
district, age, language, etc. before appointments are made.
For such reasons 3929 vacancies remained unfilled by the
time  the  panel’s  validity  expired.  Before  that,  12,571
appointments were made. 
16

27.
As earlier noted, the selection process for appointment to
the posts of primary teacher is to be made by assessment of
merit by the Selection Committee as notified under Rule 8 of
the  Recruitment  Rules,  2016.  The  recruitment  process
initiated  on 23.12.2020  cannot continue  indefinitely.  The
2020  recruitment  process  had  concluded  and  the  fresh
recruitment process commenced thereafter vide notification
dated 29.09.2022. It would therefore not be appropriate for
this Court to direct appointments to be made against the
remaining 3929 vacancies, from the already-expired Merit
List.
28.
Dr.  Menaka  Guruswamy,  learned  senior  counsel,  placed
heavy reliance on the ratio in Dinesh Kumar Kashyap & Ors.
v.  South  East  Central  Railway  &  Ors.5 to  contend  that
although the selected candidate may not have any vested
right to be appointed against the available vacancies but
when  the  employer  decides  not  to  fill  up  the  posts,  the
discretion  is  to  be  exercised  judiciously.  On  this  aspect,
suffice it would be to say that the Rules provided for shelf
5 (2019) 12 SCC 798.
17

life of one year for the panel list. Admittedly, extension of the
said list (notified on 15.02.2021) was not granted by any
authority. As the decision to not act upon the expired select
list  is  based  upon  the  provisions  of  the  Rules,  we  are
disinclined to accept the argument advanced by the learned
senior counsel based on the ratio in Dinesh Kumar Kashyap.
It may also be noted that the candidates in  Dinesh Kumar
Kashyap (supra)  had  approached  the  Court  during  the
validity of the select list unlike in these matters where the
first batch of Writ Petitions came to be filed in May 2022,
i.e., roughly three months after the expiry of the said Merit
List in February 2022.
29.
In light of the above discussion, the following conclusions
are reached:
i.
The manner of shortlisting candidates for appointment
as suggested by the Division Bench in the impugned
judgments  is  inconsistent  with  the  procedure  laid
down under Rule 8 of the Recruitment Rules, 2016, and
those, cannot be sustained.
ii.
The Panel or Merit List as notified on 15.02.2021 stood
18

extinguished  after  expiry  of  one  year  i.e.,  on
15.02.2022, as per Rule 12 of the  Recruitment Rules,
2016.
iii.
No extension by any competent authority was granted
to the 15.02.2021 Panel and therefore no relief can be
granted  to  candidates  who  approached  the  court  in
May 2022, i.e., long after the panel stood extinguished.
iv.
No  further  appointments  is  permissible  from  the
recruitment process initiated on 23.12.2020 when a
fresh recruitment process has commenced.
30.
The impugned judgment rendered by the Division Bench on
11.11.2022 and the earlier direction given by the learned
Single Judge on 26.09.2022 are accordingly set aside. The
concerned 252 Writ Petitioners and others who are sailing
with  this  group,  do  not  have  any  legitimate  claim  for
appointments, to the remaining vacancies in the form of the
23.12.2020 recruitment process.  The appeals stand allowed
accordingly.
31.
The IA No. 28252 of 2024 and IA No. 28255 of 2024 are
allowed  to  the  extent  of  the  prayers  made  by  the
19

applicant(s).   All  pending  application(s),  if  any,  including
impleadment  or  intervention  application(s),  shall  stand
disposed of.
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1873 OF 2024
32.
In view of the order passed in Civil Appeal Nos. 1875-1876
of 2024, this appeal stands disposed of.
33.
All pending application(s), if any, including impleadment/
intervention application(s) shall stand disposed of.
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1874 OF 2024
34.
In view of the order passed in Civil Appeal Nos. 1875-1876
of 2024, this appeal stands disposed of.

All pending application(s), if any, including impleadment/
intervention application(s) shall stand disposed of.
