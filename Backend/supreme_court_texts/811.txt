1.     On the perception of the capability of drivers on the road, the 
comedian George Carlin made the humorous observation to the 
effect that: ‘Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than 

Page 6 of 126 
 
you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?’1. 
Concerns about road safety are often shaped by individual biases 
without the opinion being founded on any empirical data. It is easy 
to overlook the full spectrum of factors that contribute to road 
safety. In this context, the pivotal legal issue that this Constitution 
bench of five judges has to decide is whether under the existing 
legal framework of the Motor Vehicle Act,1988 (for short “MV Act”) 
and the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989  (for short, “MV Rules”), 
a person holding a license for a ‘Light Motor Vehicle’ class, can 
drive a ‘Transport Vehicle’ without a specific endorsement, 
provided the ‘Gross Vehicle Weight’ of the vehicle does not exceed 
7,500 kgs?. Besides road safety, the livelihood concern of a large 
number of drivers of transport vehicles in India also requires an 
answer from the bench. In this judgment, let us name our driver 
Sri, who is a ‘Transport Vehicle’ driver. As can be appreciated, Sri 
spends maximum hours behind the driving wheels and is arguably 
the most experienced one amongst Indian drivers, carrying goods 
and people, from destination A to B and so on.

A. BACKGROUND 
2. 
Before we set out the relevant provisions, a brief overview of 
the legal journey that has led us to the above quest would be 
appropriate. The vexed question was first noticed by a 2-judge 
Bench of Justice Kurian Joseph and Justice Arun Mishra in 
Mukund Dewangan v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. 2 (for short 
“Mukund Dewangan(2016)”. It took note of the conflicting views in 
8 different judgments of this Court and framed the following 
questions for determination by a 3-judge bench:  
“59.1. What is the meaning to be given to the definition of 
“light motor vehicle” as defined in Section 2(21) of the MV 
Act? Whether transport vehicles are excluded from it? 
59.2. Whether “transport vehicle” and “omnibus” the “gross 
vehicle weight” of either of which does not exceed 7500 kg 
would be a “light motor vehicle” and also motor car or tractor 
or a roadroller, “unladen weight” of which does not exceed 
7500 kg and holder of licence to drive class of “light motor 
vehicle” as provided in Section 10(2)(d) would be competent 
to drive a transport vehicle or omnibus, the “gross vehicle 
weight” of which does not exceed 7500 kg or a motor car or 
tractor or roadroller, the “unladen weight” of which does not 
exceed 7500 kg? 
59.3. What is the effect of the amendment made by virtue of 
Act 54 of 1994 w.e.f. 14-11-1994 while substituting clauses 
(e) to (h) of Section 10(2) which contained “medium goods 
vehicle”, “medium passenger motor vehicle”, “heavy goods 
vehicle” and “heavy passenger motor vehicle” by “transport 
vehicle”? Whether insertion of the expression “transport 
vehicle” under Section 10(2)(e) is related to the said 
 
2 (2016) 4 SCC 298 

Page 8 of 126 
 
substituted classes only or it also excluded transport vehicle 
of light motor vehicle class from the purview of Sections 
10(2)(d) and 2(41) of the Act? 
59.4. What is the effect of amendment of Form 4 as to 
operation of the provisions contained in Section 10 as 
amended in the year 1994 and whether procedure to obtain 
driving licence for transport vehicle of class of “light motor 
vehicle” has been changed?” 
3. 
Speaking through Justice Arun Mishra, the reference was 
answered by a 3-Judge Bench of Justice Arun Mishra, Justice 
Amitava Roy, and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul in Mukund 
Dewangan v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. 3  (for short “Mukund 
Dewangan(2017)”).  The Bench concluded that the holder of a 
license for a ‘Light Motor Vehicle’ class need not have a separate 
endorsement to drive a ‘transport vehicle’ if it falls under the ‘Light 
Motor Vehicle’ class i.e. below 7,500 kgs. The reference was 
answered as under:  
“60.1 ‘Light motor vehicle’ as defined in section 2(21) of the 
Act would include a transport vehicle as per the weight 
prescribed 
in section 
2(21) read 
with section 
2(15) and 2(48). Such transport vehicles are not excluded 
from the definition of the light motor vehicle by virtue of 
Amendment Act No.54/1994. 
60.2. A transport vehicle and omnibus, the gross vehicle 
weight of either of which does not exceed 7500 kg. would be 
a light motor vehicle and also motor car or tractor or a road 
roller, ‘unladen weight’ of which does not exceed 7500 kg. 
and holder of a driving licence to drive class of “light motor 
vehicle” as provided in section 10(2)(d) is competent to drive 
a transport vehicle or omnibus, the gross vehicle weight of 
which does not exceed 7500 kg. or a motor car or tractor or 
 
3  (2017) 14 SCC 663 

Page 9 of 126 
 
road-roller, the “unladen weight” of which does not exceed 
7500 kg. That is to say, no separate endorsement on the 
licence is required to drive a transport vehicle of light 
motor vehicle class as enumerated above. A licence issued 
under section 
10(2)(d) continues 
to 
be 
valid 
after 
Amendment Act 54/1994 and 28.3.2001 in the form. 
60.3. The effect of the amendment made by virtue of Act 
No.54/1994 w.e.f. 14.11.1994 while substituting clauses (e) 
to (h) of section 10(2) which contained “medium goods 
vehicle” in section 10(2)(e), medium passenger motor vehicle 
in section 
10(2)(f), 
heavy 
goods 
vehicle 
in section 
10(2)(g) and “heavy passenger motor vehicle” in section 
10(2)(h) with expression ‘transport vehicle’ as substituted 
in section 10(2)(e) related only to the aforesaid substituted 
classes only. It does not exclude transport vehicle, from the 
purview of section 10(2)(d) and section 2(41) of the Act i.e. 
light motor vehicle. 
60.4. The effect of amendment of Form 4 by insertion of 
“transport vehicle” is related only to the categories which 
were substituted in the year 1994 and the procedure to 
obtain driving licence for transport vehicle of class of “light 
motor vehicle” continues to be the same as it was and has 
not been changed and there is no requirement to obtain 
separate endorsement to drive transport vehicle, and if a 
driver is holding licence to drive light motor vehicle, he 
can drive transport vehicle of such class without any 
endorsement to that effect.”

4. 
However, the above pronouncement did not put the matter to 
rest. On 3.5.2018, a two-judge Bench comprising Justice Kurian 
Joseph & Justice Mohan M. Shantanagoudar in M/s. Bajaj 
Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rambha Devi & Ors.4 noted 
that while deciding the vexed question in Mukund Dewangan 
(2017), the 3 Judge-bench had not considered important 
 
4 (2019) 12 SCC 816 

Page 10 of 126 
 
provisions of the MV Act and MV Rules. The bench noted that the 
following significant provisions were not placed before the Court in 
Mukund Dewangan(2017): 
“3. It is the submission of Shri Jayant Bhushan and Shri 
Joy Basu, learned Senior Counsel that certain distinct 
provisions pertaining specifically to transport vehicles 
have unfortunately not been brought to the notice of the 
Court: 
1. Section 4(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter 
referred to as “the Act”) provides that the minimum age of 
holding a driving licence for a motor vehicle is 18 years. 
Section 4(2) provides that no person under the age of 20 
years shall drive a transport vehicle in a public place. 
2. Section 7 provides that no person can be granted a 
learner's licence to drive a transport vehicle unless he has 
held a driving licence to drive a light motor vehicle for at 
least one year. 
3. Section 14 deals with the currency of licence to drive 
motor vehicles. A driving licence issued or renewed under 
this Act, in case a licence to drive a transport vehicle will 
be effective for a period of three years. The proviso to 
Section 14(2)(a) provides that in case of a licence to drive 
a transport vehicle carrying goods of dangerous or 
hazardous nature, it shall be effective for a period of one 
year. However, in case of any other licence, it would be 
effective for a period of 20 years. 
4. Rule 5 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 
(hereinafter referred to as “the Rules”) makes a medical 
certificate issued by a registered medical practitioner 
mandatory in case of a transport vehicle, whereas for a 
non-transport vehicle, only a self-declaration is sufficient. 
5. Rule 31, specifically sub-rules (2), (3) and (4) provide for 
a difference in the syllabus and duration of training 
between transport and non-transport vehicles. 
It is also submitted that in these provisions, there does not 
appear to be any exception carved out for transport 
vehicles which come in the light motor vehicle category.” 

Page 11 of 126 
 
5. 
Being a two-judge bench, the Court deemed it appropriate to 
refer the prayer itself for reconsideration of the ratio in Mukund 
Dewangan(2017) to a larger bench of three judges. Subsequently, 
a three-Judge bench of  Justice U.U. Lalit, Justice S. Ravindra 
Bhat,  and Justice P.S. Narasimha on 8.3.20225 noted that the 
referral order rightly observed that certain provisions of the MV Act 
and MV Rules were not noticed in Mukund Dewangan (2017).   The 
3-judge bench flagged certain additional provisions that were not 
noticed in  Mukund Dewangan(2017).   Since such a view was 
expressed by a Bench of equal strength, it was considered 
appropriate to refer the matter to a larger bench of five judges. The 
reference order reads as under:  
       “5. Mr. Jayant Bhushan, Mr. Gopal Sankaranaryanan, Mr. 
Siddhartha Dave, learned Senior Advocates as well as Mr. 
Amit Singh, Ms. Archana Pathak Dave, Mr. Kaustubh 
Shukla, Ms. Meenakshi Midha and Mr. Rajesh Kumar 
Gupta, 
learned 
Advocates, 
appearing 
for 
Insurance 
Companies have invited our attention to few other 
provisions, namely, the second proviso to Section 15 and 
Sections 180 and 181 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 apart 
from those mentioned in the referral order. It is submitted 
that though Section 3 was quoted in the decision in Mukund 
Dewangan (supra), the latter part of Section 3 and the effect 
thereof was not noticed by the Court. The latter part of said 
Section 3 stipulates that “no person shall so drive a transport 
vehicle other than the motor cab or motor cycle hired for his 
own use or rented under any scheme made under any 
scheme made under sub-section (2) of Section 75 unless his 
driving licence specifically entitles him so to do.”  
 
5 Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rambha Devi, (2023) 4 SCC 
723 

Page 12 of 126 
 
        6. It is thus submitted that the provisions contemplate 
different regimes for those having licence to drive Light Motor 
Vehicles as against those licensed to drive Transport 
Vehicles.  
        7. Having bestowed our attention to the contentions raised 
by the learned counsel and the issues which fall for 
consideration, in our view, the referral order was right in 
stating that certain provisions were not noticed by this Court 
in its decision in Mukund Dewangan (supra). We are prima 
facie of the view that in terms of the referral order, the 
controversy in question needs to be re visited. Sitting in a 
combination of Three Judges, we deem it appropriate to refer 
the matters to a larger bench of more than Three Judges as 
the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India may deem appropriate 
to constitute” 
6. For the benefit of the claimants, the reference order also 
pertinently notes that:  
“9. Before we part, we must note that all the learned counsel 
appearing for the Insurance companies have fairly submitted 
that the compensation in terms of the directions issued by 
the Courts below, that is to say, in following the principles 
laid down in Mukund Dewangan (supra) has either been paid 
in full or shall be paid in terms of such directions. Their 
statements are recorded.” 
7. Thus, the correctness of Mukund Dewangan(2017) is to be 
evaluated during this reference. At this juncture, we may note that 
during the final stage of hearing before this Court on 20.7.2023, it 
was brought to our notice that the Union Government had 
accepted the decision in Mukund Dewangan(2017), by issuing 
notifications dated 16.4.2018 and 31.3.2021. The Rules were also 
amended to bring them in conformity with the said judgment. 
Considering such compliance, we sought the assistance of the 
learned Attorney General, Mr. R. Venkataramani and desired to 

Page 13 of 126 
 
elicit the specific stand of the Union Government on the issue. 
When the matter was next heard on 13.9.20236, the following order 
was passed by this 5-judge bench:  
“8. Mr. R Venkataramani, Attorney General for India, has 
appeared in response to the request of the Court and 
submitted a written note. The note submitted by the 
Attorney General indicates that:  
(i) 
Application of the ratio in Mukund Dewangan 
(supra) enables a person holding a licence for a light 
motor vehicle to drive a transport vehicle on the 
strength of that licence without a separate transport 
vehicle licence; and  
(ii) 
This interpretation of the provisions of the statute 
and the Rules in Mukund Dewangan (supra) does 
not appear to be in accord with the legislative intent. 
9.  The note also indicates that the letter dated 16 April 
2018 was issued by the Union government taking note of 
the judgment in Mukund Dewangan (supra) as the law 
declared by this Court. Resultantly, the notification dated 
31 March 2021 was issued to further amend the Rules to 
bring them in conformity with the judgment. However, the 
Attorney General has submitted that this may not be 
treated as a policy declaration by the Union Government 
and, as such, the letter and the notification may not have 
any bearing or conclusiveness on the state of law to be 
clarified.  
10. At the same time, it has been submitted that the Union 
of India is open to the need, if any, to issue 
guidelines/regulations to address the perceived gaps in 
law as understood in the judgment of this Court in 
Mukund Dewangan (supra).  
11. Apart from the specific submission of the Union 
Government during the course of hearing, that it is open 
to re-evaluate the position in law, we are of the considered 
view that it would be necessary for the Union Government 
to have a fresh look at the matter. We are inclined to take 
this view for the following reasons:  
 
6 Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rambha Devi, (2024) 1 SCC 
818 

Page 14 of 126 
 
(i) 
Since the enactment of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988, 
there has been a rapid evolution of the transport 
sector, particularly in the last few years with the 
emergence 
of 
new 
infrastructure 
and 
new 
arrangements for putting into place private transport 
arrangements;  
(ii) 
Any interpretation or formulation of the law must 
duly take into account valid concerns of road safety 
bearing on the safety of users of public transport 
facilities;  
(iii) 
Any change in the position of law as expressed in 
Mukund Dewangan (supra) would undoubtedly have 
an impact on persons who have obtained insurance 
relying on the law declared by this Court and who 
may be driving commercial vehicles with LMV 
licences. A large number of persons would be 
dependent on the sector for earning their livelihood; 
and  
(iv) 
The decision in Mukund Dewangan (supra) has held 
the field for nearly six years and the impact of the 
reversal of the decision, at this stage, particularly on 
the social sector, is a facet which would have to be 
placed in balance by the policy arm of the 
Government.  
12. The considerations which have been flagged above do 
not necessarily weigh in the same direction. However, all 
of them do raise important issues of policy which must be 
assessed and evaluated by the Union Government. 
Whether a change in the law is warranted is a matter 
which has to be determined by the Union Government 
after taking a considered decision bearing in mind the 
diverse considerations which fall within its remit in 
making policy choices and decisions.  
13. Having regard to these features, we are of the view that 
the issue of interpretation which has been referred to the 
Constitution Bench by the referral order dated 8 March 
2022 should await a careful evaluation of the policy 
considerations which may weigh with the Government in 
deciding as to whether the reversal of the decision as it 
obtains in Mukund Dewangan (supra) is warranted and, if 
so, the way forward that must be adopted bearing in mind 
the diverging interests, some of which have been noted in 
the earlier part of the order.  
14. Hence, in view of the consequences which may arise 
by the reversal of the judgment in Mukund Dewangan 

Page 15 of 126 
 
(supra), it would be appropriate if the entire matter is 
evaluated by the Government before this Court embarks 
upon the interpretative exercise. Once the Court is 
apprised of the considered view of the Union Government, 
the proceedings before the Constitution Bench can be 
taken up.  
15. We request the Union Government to carry out this 
exercise within a period of two months.  
16. We clarify that we have not expressed any opinion on 
the merits of the referral order dated 8 March 2022 or on 
the correctness of the decision in Mukund Dewangan 
(supra) which would await further arguments once the 
considered view of the Union Government is placed before 
this Court.” 
8.  In view of the consultative exercise being carried out by the 
government, the matter was deferred multiple times. On 
16.4.2024, a note on the proposed set of amendments to the MV 
Act was submitted before this Court. On 21.8.2024, the learned 
Attorney General, R. Venkataramani had suggested that the 
matter be either deferred till the amendments are tabled before 
Parliament or the Court may conclude the pending hearing. We 
then proceeded to hear the part-heard matter on 21.8.2024.  
  B. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMPANIES 
9. We have heard Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General;  
learned Senior Counsel Mr. Siddhartha Dave, Mr. Jayant 
Bhushan; Ms. Archana Pathak Dave, Mr. Neeraj Kishan Kaul, 
learned Senior Counsel; Mr. Amit Kumar Singh and Mr. Shivam 
Singh, Learned Counsel on behalf of the Insurance Companies. 

Page 16 of 126 
 
Mr. PB Suresh appeared as a supporting Intervenor for the ‘The 
Society against Drunk Driving’. 
9.1. Mr. Siddhartha Dave, learned Senior Counsel took us through 
those provisions of the MV Act and MV Rules that create a 
distinction between ‘Light Motor Vehicles’ and ‘Transport Vehicles’.  
9.2. The Counsel drew the Court’s attention to Section 3 of the MV 
Act which stipulates the ‘necessity for a driving license’ to drive a 
motor vehicle.  He referred to the second part of the provision 
which states that ‘no person shall so drive a transport 
vehicle…unless his driving license specifically entitles him so to do.’ 
It was contended that Mukund Dewangan (2017) overlooked that 
there was a specific mention of ‘transport vehicle’ in Section 3 
which would indicate that a license for a ‘light motor vehicle’ 
cannot be used for driving a ‘transport vehicle’. 
9.3.  Mr. Dave further argued that the eligibility for obtaining a 
license for transport vehicles is more stringent than for Light Motor 
Vehicles. Since transport vehicles are primarily utilized for 
carrying passengers and goods, the additional requirements are 
essential for ensuring road safety.  Adverting to Section 4 of the 
MV Act, which sets out the age limit,  the Counsel highlighted that 
the minimum age for securing a driving license for ‘motor vehicles’ 

Page 17 of 126 
 
is 18 years but for driving ‘transport vehicles’, Section 4(2) provides 
that the minimum age would be 20. Moreover, to qualify even for 
a learner’s license to drive a ‘transport vehicle’, Section 7(1) 
stipulates that a candidate must have held a driving license for a 
‘Light Motor Vehicle’, for at least one year.  
9.4. Section 8(3) mandates that an individual applying for a 
learner’s license for a transport vehicle, must submit a medical 
certificate from a registered medical practitioner, attesting to the 
applicant’s physical fitness to operate a transport vehicle. 
However, such a requirement is absent in the case of a Light Motor 
Vehicle for which only a self-declaration is sufficient. Additionally, 
the second proviso to Section 15 of MV Act stipulates that a medical 
certificate is also necessary for the renewal of a driving license for 
‘transport vehicles’. Section 9(4) requires that the applicant for a 
‘transport vehicle’ license must possess a driving certificate from a 
driving school or establishment. It was further submitted that the 
1994 amendment to Section 10 merged four classes of (i) ‘medium 
goods vehicle’, (ii) ‘medium passenger vehicle’, (iii) ‘heavy goods 
vehicle’ and (iv) ‘heavy passenger vehicle’, into a single class of 
‘transport vehicle’ under Section10(2)(e) of MV Act. Section 10(2)(d) 
on the other hand provides for a separate class of ‘Light Motor 
Vehicle’. Therefore, the retention of the separate classes of 

Page 18 of 126 
 
‘transport vehicle’ and ‘light motor vehicle’ under Section 10(2) by 
the 1994 Amendment, implies that the two classes are not co-
equals, and the license holder of a ‘Light Motor Vehicle’ is not 
eligible to drive a ‘Transport Vehicle’. A separate license would be 
mandatory is the argument of the counsel.  
9.5. Mr. Jayant Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel argued that 
Mukund Dewangan (2017) erred in two significant respects. The 
judgment overlooked Section 3, which mandates a separate 
endorsement for driving a ‘transport vehicle’. Reliance was placed 
on the decision in Nathi Devi v Radha Devi Gupta7 , where it was 
held that ‘effort should be made to give effect to each and every 
word used by the Legislature.’ Therefore, it was projected that the 
Court should not disregard any part of Section 3 in its 
interpretation.  
9.6. The other reason why Mukund Dewangan (2017) was 
incorrect according to Mr. Bhushan, was because it focused  on 
the general law, rather than the special provisions within the MV 
Act. It was therefore argued that it is a well-known principle that 
the general will not override the special (Generalia Specialibus Non 
Derogant) and the special will override the general (Specialia 
 
7 (2005) 2 SCC 271 

Page 19 of 126 
 
Generalibus Derogant). It was pointed out that Section 10(2) 
explicitly distinguishes between ‘Transport Vehicles’ and LMV, 
treating them as separate categories. Mukund Dewangan (2017) 
erroneously subsumed ‘transport vehicles’ under the broader 
category of ‘Light Motor Vehicles’.  It was also contended that the 
requirements for obtaining a transport vehicle license are distinct 
and more rigorous because the drivers of transport vehicles are 
entrusted with the safety of passengers including school children 
and strangers, who repose their trust in the driver of the transport 
vehicle.  
9.7. In his turn, Mr. Neeraj Kishan Kaul, learned Senior Counsel 
emphasized that the classification of transport vehicles under 
7500 kg within the definition of Light Motor Vehicles under Section 
2(21) is a broad definition, based on weight. He contended that this 
classification does not imply that the licensing regime under the 
MV Act is also determined by weight.  According to the Counsel, 
licensing under the MV Act is linked to the intended ‘use’ of the 
vehicle. Specific attention was drawn to the definition of a 
Transport Vehicle in Section 2(47), which refers to a ‘public service 
vehicle’, a ‘goods carriage’, an ‘educational institution bus’ or a 
‘private service vehicle’. Mr. Kaul argued that in the separate 
definition for each of these categories, one common factor is 

Page 20 of 126 
 
discernible as each provision uses words like ‘use’, ‘used or 
adapted to be used’, ‘constructed or adapted for use’. This shows 
that the licensing scheme is based on usage and not the weight of 
the vehicle.  
9.8.Mr. Tushar Mehta, Learned Solicitor General submitted that 
the definition under Section 2(21) which includes transport 
vehicles is for a different regime, set under Section 113 and 115 of 
MV Act.  These sections are contained in Chapter VII which is titled 
‘Control of Traffic’ and pertain to ‘limits of weight and limitations 
on use’ and ‘power to restrict the use of vehicles’.  In this context, 
vehicles of specific weight may be prohibited from certain roads or 
areas thereby, making weight a relevant factor. Under the said 
definition of LMV, ‘weight’ has been kept as a factor for 
demarcation between ‘LMV’ and ‘Transport’ vehicles only for the 
purposes of determining the ‘road tax’. Rule 31(2) and Rule 31(3) 
of the Rules prescribe the syllabus for training drivers for ‘Non-
Transport’ and ‘Transport’ vehicles respectively. It was submitted 
that the said syllabuses are not the same. Also, the MV Act provides 
that the minimum period of training shall not be less than 21 days 
for ‘Non-Transport’ vehicles, as opposed to ‘Transport’ vehicles, for 
which the minimum period of training shall not be less than 30 
days.  

Page 21 of 126 
 
9.9. In her turn, Ms. Archana Pathak Dave, learned Senior 
Counsel presented to the Bench a photograph of a bus weighing 
7450 kg,  just below the limit of 7500 kg. She argued that if a  
school bus is operated by someone holding a Light Motor Vehicle 
license, it could be very risky. It was asserted that weight should 
not be a determining factor for licensing, rather it may be relevant 
in contexts such as taxes, permits, and other regulatory 
considerations. 
Ms. 
Dave 
pointed 
out 
that 
Mukund 
Dewangan(2017) failed to acknowledge the necessity of a Form 7 
endorsement for LMV license holders to drive transport vehicles. 
This endorsement is crucial, as LMV license holders cannot legally 
drive transport vehicles without it. Furthermore, Section 9(6) 
requires competence testing, specific to the type of vehicle, 
necessitating separate licenses for LMV and Transport Vehicles to 
maintain the MV Act's regulatory coherence. 
9.10. Mr. P.B. Suresh, learned Counsel representing the 
Intervenor - The Society Against Drunken Driving, an NGO argued 
that road safety is considered a fundamental right. He argued that 
the decision in Mukund Dewangan (2017) has led to unsafe roads 
by permitting untrained drivers to operate transport vehicles. It 
was submitted that Section 7 of the MV Act requires an individual 

Page 22 of 126 
 
to hold a driver’s license for at least one year to obtain a learner’s 
license for a transport vehicle, which is a critical safety measure.  
9.11. Mr. Shivam Singh, learned Counsel argued that motor 
vehicle insurance policies had ensured adequate risk coverage only 
when accidents were caused by vehicles for which, drivers had 
valid licenses. However, in Mukund Dewangan (2017), this court 
referred to the weight of the vehicle, rather than vehicle usage, as 
a relevant marker for statutory purposes. Consequently, insurance 
coverage through judicial decisions had to be extended to cases 
where drivers with LMV licenses were driving vehicles outside their 
licensing permits. 
C. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF CLAIMANTS 
10.  On behalf of the Claimants, we have heard learned Senior 
Counsel, Ms. Anitha Shenoy, and the respective submissions of 
Mr. Devvrat, Mr. Kaustubh Shukla and Mr. Anuj Bhandari learned 
Counsel.  While supporting the interpretation in Mukund 
Dewangan (2017) the Counsel would contend that the vehicles 
under the MV Act are differentiated according to their weight.    
They argue that the definition of ‘light motor vehicle’ in Section 
2(21) is an inclusive definition which encompasses multiple variety 

Page 23 of 126 
 
of vehicles including transport vehicles, the weight of which does 
not exceed 7500 kg. 
10.1.  The learned Counsel, Mr. Devvrat contended that the 
licensing system under the MV Act, categorises motor vehicles into 
two primary groups i.e. Light and Heavy categories—LMV and 
HMV respectively. It was argued that if a motorcycle used for hire, 
weighing less than 200kg falls under the class of transport 
vehicles, countless drivers operating on platforms like Rapido, a 
bike-or-hire service, would be required to obtain fresh licenses if 
Mukund Dewangan(2017) is overruled.  
10.2. Mr. Anuj Bhandari, learned Counsel arguing for the 
Claimants, took us through the history of the inclusion of 
“transport vehicles” as a class, under the MV Act.  It was submitted 
that for the last 34 years, licenses have been granted in the country 
on the basis of weight of the vehicle. Even today, Form 2 specifies 
the grant of licenses based on weight, with exceptions being made 
for vehicles like road rollers, e-rickshaws, or a motorcycle. He 
pointed out that the original legislation identified four types of 
vehicles: (i) medium goods vehicles, (ii) medium passenger 
vehicles, (iii) heavy goods vehicles and (iv) heavy passenger 
vehicles. With the 1994 amendments to the MV Act, these 

Page 24 of 126 
 
categories were clubbed into a single classification of “transport 
vehicles.” Building on this, Mr. Bhandari contended that 
“transport vehicles” under the MV Act meant medium and heavy 
vehicles.  Therefore, individuals with an LMV license were entitled 
to drive a light transport vehicle weighing less than 7500 
kilograms. Whereas, additional requirements of a medical 
certificate and experience would apply only to those medium and 
heavy transport vehicles which exceed the weight limit of 7,500 
kgs. It was argued that the Parliament changed the nomenclature 
by merging the four categories into a single class of ‘Transport 
Vehicles’, to ‘simplify’ the licensing scheme.  
10.3. Mr. Kaustubh Shukla, Learned Counsel projected that 
careful reading of all the definitions in Section 2 would make it 
clear that the definitions were primarily bifurcated as follows: 
       “a.  ‘Class of vehicle,’ which mandatorily referred to 
weight: LMV [Sec. 2(21)] up to 7500 KG, HMV 
(Passenger/Goods) [Sec. 2(16) & Sec. 2(17)] exceeding 
12000 KG, MMV (Passenger/Goods) [Sec. 2(23) & Sec. 
2(24)] between 7500 to 12000 KG. 
       b. ‘Kind or Name’ (Description) of vehicle, which had 
no reference to weight: [Sec. 2(7), 2(11), 2(14), 2(22), 
2(25), 2(27), 2(28), 2(29), 2(33), 2(39), 2(40), 2(43), 
2(44), 2(46), 2(47)].” 
The legislature, according to the counsel, intended to demarcate 
vehicles depending upon the weight of the vehicle and not their 

Page 25 of 126 
 
description. Thus, according to him, the entire licensing scheme 
must take into account the weight classification, to ensure clarity. 
The earlier unamended act set the weight limit at 6000 kg which 
was further raised to 7500 kg by way of the 1994 amendment. 
Therefore, the legislature intended to demarcate vehicles 
depending on the weight and not the description of vehicle. It was 
further argued that in the event of a conflict between the Act and 
the Rules, Schedules, or Forms, the provisions of the Act will take 
precedence. Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in 
Aphali Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra8.  
10.4 Ms. Anitha Shenoy, Learned Senior Counsel additionally 
argued that on the strength of Mukund Dewangan(2017), the auto 
drivers  were permitted to operate taxis and motorcabs while 
holding a driving licence for LMV for the past 6 years. 
Reconsideration of the same is not merely an issue of insurance 
coverage, rather it would directly impact the livelihood of those 
driving transport vehicles with an LMV license.  Their rights under 
Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India should also be factored 
in for the interpretative exercise.

D. ISSUES 
11. From the above submissions, the following specific issues fall 
for our consideration:  
(i) Whether a driver holding an LMV license (for vehicles with 
a gross vehicle weight of less than 7,500 kgs) as per Section 
10(2)(d), which specifies ‘Light Motor Vehicle’, can operate a 
‘Transport Vehicle’ without obtaining specific authorization 
under Section 10(2)(e) of the MV Act,  specifically for the 
‘Transport Vehicle’ class;     
(ii) Whether the second part of Section 3(1) which 
emphasizes the necessity of a driving license for a ‘Transport 
Vehicle’ overrides the definition of LMV in Section 2(21) of 
MV Act? Is the definition of LMV contained in Section 2(21) 
of MV Act unrelated to the licensing framework under the MV 
Act and the MV Rules; 
(iii) Whether the additional eligibility criteria prescribed in 
the MV Act and MV Rules for ‘transport vehicles’ would apply 
to those who are desirous of driving vehicles weighing below 
7,500 kgs and have obtained a license for LMV class under 
Section 10(2)(d) of the MV Act ; 

Page 27 of 126 
 
(iv) What is the effect of the amendment made by virtue of 
Act 54 of 1994 w.e.f. 14.11.1994 which substituted four 
classes under clauses (e) to (h) in Section 10 with a single 
class of ‘Transport Vehicle’ in Section 10(2)(e)?  
(v) Whether the decision in Mukund Dewangan(2017) is per 
incuriam for not noticing certain provisions of the MV Act and 
MV Rules? 
E. DISCUSSION 
(I) The Purpose of the MV Act,1988 
12.  Prior to the enactment of the MV Act 1988, the legal 
framework governing motor vehicles was based on the Motor 
Vehicle Act,1939 which was incorporated from the English Road 
Traffic Act,1930. In January 1984, a working group was 
constituted to review all provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act,1939 
and to propose necessary amendments. This culminated in the 
enactment of the MV Act,1988 which has since undergone several 
amendments. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the MV 
Act,1988  is extracted below for ready reference: 
“2. Various Committees, like, National Transport Policy 
Committee, National Police Commission, Road Safety 
Committee, Low Powered Two - Wheelers Committee, as also 
the Law Commission have gone into different aspects of road 
transport. They have recommended updating, simplification 
and rationalization of this law. Several Members of 
Parliament have also urged for comprehensive review of the 

Page 28 of 126 
 
Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, to make it relevant to the modern - 
day requirements.  
3. A Working Group was, therefore, constituted in January, 
1984 to review all the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 
1939 and to submit draft proposals for a comprehensive 
legislation to replace the existing Act. This Working Group 
took into account the suggestions and recommendations 
earlier made by various bodies and institutions like Central 
Institute of Road Transport (CIRT), Automotive Research 
Association of India (ARAI), and other transport organisations 
including, the manufacturers and the general public, 
Besides, obtaining comments of State Governments on the 
recommendations of the Working Group, these were 
discussed in a specially convened meeting of Transport 
Ministers of all States and Union territories. Some of the more 
important modifications so suggested related for taking care 
of – 
(a) the fast increasing number of both commercial vehicles 
and personal vehicles in the country ;  
(b) the need for encouraging adoption of higher technology in 
automotive sector;  
(c) the greater flow of passenger and freight with the least 
impediments so that islands of isolation are not created 
leading to regional or local imbalances;  
(d) concern for road safety standards, and pollution-control 
measures, standards for transportation of hazardous and 
explosive materials; 
 (e) simplification of procedure and policy liberalization for 
private sector operations in the road transport field ; and  
(f) need for effective ways of tracking down traffic offenders.”  
 
13. As per the Statement of Objects and Reasons, the important 
provisions addressed the following: 
“(a) rationalization of certain definitions with additions of 
certain new definitions of new types of vehicles;  
(b) stricter procedures relating to grant of driving licences 
and the period of validity thereof;  
(c) laying down of standards for the components and parts of 
motor vehicles;  
(d) standards for anti-pollution control devices;  

Page 29 of 126 
 
(e) provision for issuing fitness certificates of vehicles also by 
the authorised testing stations;  
(f) enabling provision for updating the system of registration 
marks;  
(g) liberalised schemes for grant of stage carriage permits on 
non nationalised routes, all-India Tourist permits and also 
national permits for goods carriages;  
(h) administration of the Solatium Scheme by the General 
Insurance Corporation;  
(i) provision for enhanced compensation in cases of “no fault 
liability” and in hit and run motor accidents;  
(j) provision for payment of compensation by the insurer to 
the extent of actual liability to the victims of motor accidents 
irrespective of the class of vehicles;  
(k) maintenance of State registers for driving licences and 
vehicle registration;  
(l) constitution of Road Safety Councils. 
 6. The Bill also seeks to provide for more deterrent 
punishment in the cases of certain offences.” 
14. The above would suggest that the enactment of the MV 
Act,1988 was driven, inter alia, by the rapidly increasing number 
of vehicles in the country, the development of the road sector and 
the need to promote the adoption of advanced technology in the 
automotive sector.  It is also essential to note that the Law 
Commission, in particular, had made various recommendations 
concerning provisions of the MV Act, 1939 and MV Act, 1988 in its 

Page 30 of 126 
 
Report Nos. 859,10610,11911 and 14912.   To further understand the 
objective of the MV Act,1988 , we may refer to the 149th Report of 
the Law Commission titled ‘Removing Certain Deficiencies in the 
Motor Vehicle Act,1988’ which noted the challenges faced by 
victims and their families in seeking compensation under the MV 
Act,1988 and the rising frequency of road accidents in the following 
words:-  
“ The frequency of accidents caused by motor vehicles and the 
pitiable plight of the victims of such accidents and dependants 
have been the subject matter of comment by the Supreme 
Court in a number of cases. During recent years, the number 
of road accidents in the country have increased more 
alarmingly. Almost every day one finds in the newspapers, sad 
tales of road accidents. …. There is therefore an urgent need 
for streamlining the mechanism through which the victims or 
their legal representatives are compensated for their loss in 
such accidents so that they may be able to receive expeditiously 
an appropriate amount as compensation for the damages 
sustained by them. It is felt all round that victims of motor 
accidents and their legal representatives, where the accident is 
fatal, besides having grievously suffered as a result of the 
unfortunate event, are subjected to the agonies and 
uncertainties of a legal battle for a number of years for receiving 
the damages due to them through the process of Court. Of late, 
Lok Adalats have been settling the cases of such nature but it 
has been found that the victims or their legal representatives 
are compelled to be satisfied with a paltry sum out of the 
damages claimed by them. Such persons have no other option 
but to settle the dispute because they do not know for how 
many more years they will have to litigate for receiving the

Motor Vehicles Act, 1939’(85th Report,1980) 
10 Law Commission of India, ‘Section 103A, Motor Vehicles Act, 1939: effect 
of Transfer of a Motor Vehicle on Insurance’ (106th Report,November,1984)

Accidents under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (119th Report, February,1987)

Vehicles Act,1988(149th Report,1994)

damages. In the backdrop of these and other related matters, 
the law commission has suo moto taken up the exercise of 
finding a solution to some of the problems relating to the 
 Motor 
Vehicle 
Act 
and 
giving 
their 
appropriate 
recommendations thereon.”  
15. The MV Act,1988  is fundamentally a social welfare legislation13 
enacted with the objective of providing a mechanism for  victims 
and their families to seek compensation for loss or injury resulting 
from road accidents. Additionally, its provisions regarding licensing 
and penalties for traffic violations serve the broader purpose of 
promoting road safety. Being a welfare legislation, it must be 
interpreted in a manner so as not to deprive the claimants of the 
benefit of the legislation. Any interpretation of its provisions must 
reflect the dual purpose, of not only as a mechanism for ensuring 
timely compensation and relief for victims of road accidents but 
also in promoting overall road safety.  
16. The issue in this reference is whether an individual holding an 
LMV license can legally drive a transport vehicle if it falls within 
the stipulated weight limit of 7,500 kgs. The genesis of the issue 
stems from disputes regarding the payment of claims by insurance 
companies for accidents involving ‘transport vehicles’ operated by 
individuals holding licenses to drive ‘light motor vehicles’. The 
 
13 Skandia Insurance Co. Ltd. v Kokilaben Chandravadan AIR 1987 SC 1184; 
Sohan Lal Passi v Sesh Reddy AIR 1996 SC 2627 

Page 32 of 126 
 
question before this Court is not one of statutory interpretation but 
also involves concerns of road safety and public welfare. In 
interpreting any statute, it is always prudent to keep an eye on the 
object and purpose of the statute, as well as the underlying reason 
and the spirit behind it. However, we are conscious of not 
overstepping into the policy domain which is essentially the 
prerogative of the legislature. The legislature is uniquely positioned 
to examine the broader social, economic and safety considerations 
that underlie transportation policy and any changes to the law 
must be rooted in comprehensive public discourse and analysis. 
Having noted the broader objective of the MV Act, let us now 
discuss the statutory scheme.  
(II) Brief Overview of the MV Act and MV Rules 
17. It is a fundamental principle of statutory interpretation that 
‘construction is to be made of all the parts together and not of one 
part only by itself’14. When attempting to discern the meaning of a 
certain provision in a statute, it is essential to consider that 
provision within the broader context of the entire legislative 
framework. The context encompasses several other critical 
dimensions. First, it involves reading the statute as a whole. 
 
14 Subba Rao J in Gurmej Singh S v Sardar Pratap Singh Kairon, AIR 1960 
SC 122 

Page 33 of 126 
 
Second, it is also crucial to take into account any previous statutes 
that are in pari materia.  Third, a comprehensive understanding of 
the general scope and purpose of the statute is essential. Finally, 
a critical aspect of interpreting any statutory provision also 
involves identifying the mischief that the legislation intended to 
address 15 .  Therefore, a nuanced and thorough interpretation 
would lend clarity and consistency in the application of legal 
principles.  
18. In this regard, Justice GP Singh in his seminal treatise on 
Interpretation of Statutes16 had this to say:  
“It is a rule now firmly established- that the intention of 
the Legislature must be found by reading the statute as a 
whole. The rule is referred to as an "elementary rule" by 
Viscount Simonds; a "compelling rule" by Lord Somervell 
of Harrow; . and a "settled rule" by BK Mukherjee . "I 
agree", said Lord Halsbury, "that you must look at the 
whole instrument inasmuch as there may be inaccuracy 
and inconsistency; you must, if you can, ascertain what is 
the meaning of the instrument taken as a whole in order 
to give effect, if it be possible to do so, to the intention of 
the framer of it".” 
19. Let us now start by noting and understanding the statutory 
framework of the MV Act and the MV Rules. A snapshot of all the 
chapters of MV Act is listed below: 
 
15 R S Raghunath v State of Karnataka, AIR 1992 SC 81; Union of 
India v. Elphinstone Spg. and Wvg. Co. Ltd., (2001) 4 SCC 139;

21.  This court, to effectively address the issue, is primarily 
concerned with Chapter II of the MV Act and the MV Rules which 
relates to licensing of drivers of motor vehicles.  The Forms 
concerning driving license appended to the MV Rules, may also 
bear a reference.  Chapter II of the MV Act contains the provisions 
dealing with the necessity for a driving license, age limit, 
responsibility of owners of motor vehicles, restrictions on the 
holding of driving licenses and the restrictions on the grant of 
learner’s licenses for certain vehicles. Section 8 and Section 9 
contain provisions concerning the application for grant of 
a learner’s license and driving license respectively. Section 10 
which is important for our purpose deals with ‘forms and contents 
of licenses to drive’. Chapter II also contains provisions for 
additions to the driving license, the licensing and regulation of 
schools or establishments for imparting instruction in driving of 
motor vehicles, the validity period of license, renewal, and 
revocation. Additionally, it also contains provisions concerning 
orders refusing or revoking driving licenses, driving licenses to 
drive motor vehicles belonging to Central Government, power of 
licensing authority to disqualify from holding a driving license or 
revoke such license, the power of Court to disqualify, suspend 
driving license in certain cases, the effect of the disqualification 

Page 36 of 126 
 
order, endorsement, and the maintenance of National and State 
Registers of Driving licenses. Finally, it also contains provisions 
relating to the power of Central and State Government to make 
Rules.  
22. The MV Rules contain the procedure concerning driving 
licenses in Chapter II. It covers, inter alia, general provisions, 
evidence as to the correctness of address and age, medical 
certificate, educational qualifications, preliminary test, application 
for a driving license, driving test, form of driving license, renewal, 
driving schools and establishments, duration of license, duplicate 
license as well as the training syllabus.  
23. The MV Act and MV Rules work in tandem, like two wheels in 
the same axle, to form a comprehensive legal framework governing 
motor vehicles in India. While the Act provides the backbone, the 
Rules provide specific provisions for implementation.  
(III) Construing Section 2(21), Section 3 and Section 10 
24. To understand the divergent interpretations on the core issue 
of whether a holder of a LMV license can operate a 'transport 
vehicle’ weighing less than 7,500 kgs, it will be necessary to first 
consider the relevant definition(s) contained in Section 2 of the MV 
Act.   The definitions deserving scrutiny are noted below for ready

Page 39 of 126 
 
25.  The term ‘Transport Vehicle’ is defined in Section 2(47) of the 
MV Act and each of the terms contained in the definition is 
separately defined in Sections 2(35),2(14), 2(11), 2(33) of the MV 
Act: 
2(47) 
“transport vehicle" means a public service vehicle, a 
goods carriage, an educational institution bus or a private 
service vehicle;”  
                                                         [emphasis supplied]

“private 
service 
vehicle” 
means 
a 
motor 
vehicle 
constructed or adapted to carry more than six persons 
excluding the driver and ordinarily used by or on behalf of 
the owner of such vehicle for the purpose of carrying persons 
for, or in connection with, his trade or business otherwise 
than for hire or reward but does not include a motor vehicle 
used for public purposes 
 
26. Rule 2 of the  MV Rules provides certain additional definitions. 
For instance,  Rule 2(c) defines an ‘agricultural tractor’ as under: 
"agricultural tractor" means any mechanically propelled 4-
wheel vehicle designed to work with suitable implements for 
various 
field 
operations 
and/or 
trailers 
to 
transport 

Page 40 of 126 
 
agricultural materials. Agricultural tractor is a non-transport 
vehicle’ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
 
 27. Significantly, a non-transport vehicle is defined in Rule 2(h): 
“"non-transport vehicle" means a motor vehicle which is not a 
transport vehicle” 
28. The definition of ‘e-cart’17 , ‘e-rickshaw’18 , ‘Battery operated 
vehicle’ 19 , ‘road ambulance’ 20 , ‘school bus 21 ’, ‘special purpose 
vehicle’ 22 , ‘motor caravan’ 23 , ‘puller tractor’ 24  and different 
categories of vehicles such as ‘Category L’25 and ‘Category M26’ are 
also provided in the MV Rules. 
29.  The above definition(s) in the MV Act and MV Rules would 
indicate that they focus on various aspects including reference by 
(i) weight such as light motor vehicle and heavy goods vehicle; (ii) 
the intended use such as educational institution bus, public 
service or private service and also (iii) the vehicle types such as 
omnibuses and motor cars.  Therefore, the scheme of the Act is not 
exactly either user-based or weight-based but is a combination of 
 
17 Rule 2(cc) 
18 Rule 2(cb) 
19 Rule 2(u) 
20 Rule 2(zb) 
21 Rule 2(zc) 
22 Rule 2(zd) 
23 Rule 2(za) 
24 Rule 2(y) 
25 Rule 2(i) 
26 Rule 2(k) 

Page 41 of 126 
 
both.  It also takes into account the evolving transportation sector 
which is reflected in the introduction of new categories of vehicles 
through various amendments such as adapted vehicles, e-carts, 
and e-rickshaws. Notably, the Supreme Court has also 
recognized 27  that hybrid rickshaws, commonly referred to as 
‘jugaad’ in India, fall under the definition of Motor Vehicle u/s 
2(28) of the MV Act.  
30.  For our discussion, much turns on the definition of LMV 
contained in Section 2(21) of the MV Act: 
“light motor vehicle" means a transport vehicle or omnibus 
the gross vehicle weight of either of which or a motorcar or 
tractor or road-roller the unladen weight of any of which, 
does not exceed 7,500 kilograms.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
 
31. The term ‘transport vehicle’, ‘gross vehicle weight’, ‘motor car’, 
‘tractor’, ‘road roller’, ‘unladen weight’ and ‘gross vehicle weight’ 
are also separately defined in the MV Act as noted earlier. In the 
context, Mr. Dave, Learned Senior Counsel appearing for one of 
the insurance companies presented to us a visual 1 page 
representation of the definition of LMV which being useful, is 
reproduced below: 
 
 
 
27Rajasthan SRTC v. Santosh, (2013) 7 SCC 107 

Page 42 of 126 
 
                                   LMV u/ 2(21) means 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Transport vehicle (u/ 2(47))- 
- Public service vehicle 
- Goods carriage 
- Educational institution bus 
- Private service bus 
Omnibus (u/ 2(29)- 
Any motor vehicle 
constructed/adapted to carry 
more than 6 persons, 
excluding driver 
Motor car (u/ 
2(26))- 
Any motor vehicle 
other than  
transport vehicle, 
omnibus road roller 
tractor, motor cycle 
or adapted vehicle 
Tractor (u/ 2(44))- 
Means a motor vehicle 
which is not itself 
constructed to carry 
any load (other than 
equipment used for 
purpose of propulsion) 
but excludes a road 
roller
Road roller (not 
defined under the 
MV Act) 
Unladen weight u/ 2(48) - weight of a vehicle or trailer including all equipment 
ordinarily used with the vehicle or trailer when working, but excluding the weight 
of a driver or attendant; and where alternative parts or bodies are used the 
unladen weight of the vehicle means the weight of the vehicle with the heaviest 
such alternative part or body 
Gross vehicle weight of which u/ 2(15) means “total weight of vehicle 
and load certified and registered by the registering authority as 
permissible for that vehicle.” 
Any of which does not exceed 7,500 Kilograms 

Page 43 of 126 
 
32.  A plain reading of the definition clause of LMV as is also clear 
from the diagram above shows that LMV, inter-alia, ‘means’ a 
‘Transport Vehicle’. The use of the word ‘means’ is crucial here 
which suggests specifics.  When the statute says that a word or a 
phrase shall “mean” (instead of say “include”), it is quite certainly 
a ‘hard and fast’, strict and exhaustive definition. Such a definition 
is an explicit statement of the full connotation of a term.28  It is a 
clear signal that the legislature did not wish to maintain a 
distinction between the two classes of vehicles.   Such an explicit 
and specific definition leaves no room for ambiguity. 
33. On the importance of definition sections, G.P. Singh in 
Interpretation of Statutes29 has the following to say:- 
“In spite of severe criticism as to utility of definitions section 
or interpretation clauses, it is common to find in a statute 
"Definitions" of certain words and expressions used 
elsewhere in the body of the statute. The object of such a 
definition is to avoid the necessity of frequent repetitions in 
describing all the subject matter to which the word or 
expression so defined is intended to apply. For instance, the 
Supreme Court held that when the word "securities" has 
been defined under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 
1956, its meaning would not vary when the same word is 
used at more than one place in the same statute, as 
otherwise it will defeat the very object of the definitive 
section.”

                 [emphasis supplied] 
34. As noticed earlier, Section 2 also begins with the phrase 
‘unless the context otherwise requires’. However, any contention 
based on a contrary context must avoid the risk of making the 
explicit definition, redundant or useless.  Here we may usefully 
extract the following :- 
“..However, it is incumbent on those who contend that the 
definition given in the interpretation clause does not apply to 
a particular section to show that the context in fact so 
requires. An argument based on contrary context which 
will make the inclusive definition inapplicable to any 
provision in the Act cannot be accepted as it would make 
the definition entirely useless. Repugnancy of a definition 
arises only when the definition does not agree with the 
subject or context; any action not in conformity with the 
definition will not obviously make it repugnant to subject or 
context of the provision containing the term defined under 
which such action is purported to have been taken. When 
the application of the definition to a term in a provision 
containing that term makes it unworkable and otiose, it can 
be said that the definition is not applicable to that provision 
because of contrary context.”30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
 
35. Considering the emphatic nature of the definition given in 
Section 2(21) which would suggest a strict interpretation, it would 
be logical to conclude that a light motor vehicle would mean a 
transport vehicle, omnibus, road roller, tractor, or motor car, 
provided the weight does not exceed 7,500 kgs. The definition as 
 
30 Justice G.P. Singh, Principles of Statutory Interpretation (LexisNexis,2016) 

Page 45 of 126 
 
understood, has an important bearing on the issuance of licenses 
and permits.  
36. The term “driving license”, which is relevant for the present 
discussion, is defined under Section 2(10) of the MV Act as a license 
authorizing a person to operate a motor vehicle of “any specified 
class or description”.  Let us now read Section 10(2) titled, ‘form 
and Contents of Licenses to drive’ which lists the different classes 
of motor vehicles. It is contained in Chapter II which deals with 
‘Licensing of Drivers of Motor Vehicles’.  A key amendment was 
carried out in the Section by deleting clauses (e), (f), (g) and (h) and 
all these were clubbed under a single head of “transport vehicle”.   
 
MV Act(pre amendment of 
14.11.1994) 
MV Act (post amendment of 
14.11.1994) 
10. Form and contents of

information 
as 
may 
be 
prescribed by the Central 
Government.  
(2) A learner’s licence or, as 
the case may be, driving

following classes, namely:—

may be, driving licence shall 
also be expressed as entitling

(b) motor cycle with gear; 
(c) invalid carriage1 ;

(e) deleted  
(f) deleted  
(g) deleted  
(h) deleted  
(i) road-roller; 
(j)motor vehicle of a specified 
description 
 
37.  In the context of the deletion of the classes of ‘medium goods 
vehicle’, ‘medium passenger vehicle’, ‘heavy goods vehicle’, and 
‘heavy passenger vehicle’ and the introduction of a separate class 
of ‘transport vehicle’ through the 1994 amendment, the counsel for 
the insurance companies contended that a specific mention of 
‘transport vehicle’ after the amendment would suggest that a 
separate endorsement would be necessary to drive a ‘transport 
vehicle’. It was further submitted that even before the 1994 
amendment, the second part of Section 3 always provided that a 
separate endorsement would be necessary.  
 
38. Section 3 is titled ‘Necessity for driving license’ and reads as 
under: 
“3. Necessity for driving licence.-- (1) No person shall drive 
a motor vehicle in any public place unless he holds an 
effective driving licence issued to him authorising him to 
drive the vehicle; and no person shall so drive a 
transport vehicle [other than a motor cab or motor cycle 
hired for his own use or rented under any scheme made 

Page 47 of 126 
 
under sub-section (2) of section 75] unless his driving 
licence specifically entitles him so to do.  
(2) The conditions subject to which sub-section (1) shall 
not apply to a person receiving instructions in driving a 
motor vehicle shall be such as may be prescribed by the 
Central Government.”  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
 
39. To deal with the above submission, let us take the hypothetical 
example of Sri -  who let us say is desirous of driving an auto in 
the year 1990. The following option(s) of classes of vehicles would 
be available to Sri, as per unamended Section 10:  
 
(a) motor cycle without gear;  
(b) motor cycle with gear;  
(c) invalid carriage;  
(d) light motor vehicle;  
(e) medium goods vehicle  
(f)medium passenger vehicle;  
(g)heavy goods vehicle;  
(h) heavy passenger vehicle. 
 
 
40. The applicant Sri would be required to fill the Form 4, 
prescribed under Rule 14 of MV Rules which was prevalent before 
28.3.2001.  The Form 4 is extracted below:-

Two specimen signatures of applicant: 
                            Strike out whichever is inapplicable.” 
 
41. Form 4 above indicates that there is no mention of ‘Transport 
Vehicle’ for the purpose of obtaining  a driving license. Moreover, 
there is no mention of a ‘light goods vehicle’ or a ‘light passenger 
vehicle’. Therefore, if Sri applies for a ‘Light Motor Vehicle’ license, 

Page 49 of 126 
 
which already  means  a ‘Transport Vehicle’ as per the definition of 
LMV contained in 2(21), can it be said that Sri cannot drive a 
‘Transport Vehicle’ because ‘his driving license specifically’ does not 
‘entitle him so to do’  as provided in the second part of Section 3? 
We think not. The specific authorization should not be understood 
to mean that Sri holding an LMV license which covers ‘Transport 
vehicle’, would be disentitled to drive a ‘Transport Vehicle’. A 
question would then arise about the purpose of explicitly 
mentioning ‘Transport Vehicle’ in Section 3 (and other provisions 
as we will discuss later)?  We may notice that there is no mention 
of the term ‘light goods vehicle’ or a ‘light passenger vehicle’ in 
Section 10 or in the definition section. On the other hand, a 
separate mention of ‘medium goods vehicle’, ‘medium passenger 
vehicle’, ‘heavy goods vehicle’ and ‘heavy passenger vehicle’ as 
incorporated in the Section 10 would suggest that it is primarily 
targeted towards ‘Transport Vehicles’ as opposed to a ‘Light Motor 
Vehicle’, which as earlier noticed could also be a ‘Non-Transport 
Vehicle’. The emphasis in the second part of Section 3 should 
therefore be understood in relation to Medium and Heavy Vehicles 
in the statutory scheme even prior to the 1994 amendment. The 
reasonable interpretation of the second part of Section 3 should 
therefore pertain to a driving license for those driving ‘medium 

Page 50 of 126 
 
goods vehicle’, ‘medium passenger vehicle’, ‘heavy goods vehicle’, 
and ‘heavy passenger vehicle’.  Such an interpretation and 
understanding would be logical because medium and heavy 
vehicles would require greater maneuverability and skill as 
compared to drivers of the LMV class. The subsequent amendment 
in Section 10 makes this position even clearer. The relevant 
portion of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the  
Amendment Act 54 of 1994 may also guide us here and is 
reproduced below: 
“(a)The introduction of newer type of vehicles and fast 
increasing number of both commercial and personal vehicles 
in the country.  
(b) Providing adequate compensation to victims of road 
accidents without going into longdrawn procedure;  
(c) Protecting consumers’ interest in Transport Sector;  
(d) Concern for road safe ty standards, transport of 
hazardous chemicals and pollution control;  
(e) Delegation of greater powers to State Transport 
Authorities and rationalising the role of public authorities in 
certain matters;  
(f) 
The 
simplification 
of 
procedures 
and 
policy 
liberalisation in the field of Road Transport;  
(g) Enhancing penalties for traffic offenders.  
 
           The Bill inter alia provides for –  
(a) modification and amplification of certain definitions of 
new type of vehicles ;  
(b) simplification of procedure for grant of driving 
licences;  
(c) putting restrictions on the alteration of vehicles;  
(d) certain exemptions for vehicles running on non-polluting 
fuels;  
(e) ceilings on individuals or company holdings removed to 
curb “benami” holdings;  

Page 51 of 126 
 
(f) states authorised to appoint one or more State Transport 
Appellate Tribunals;  
(g) punitive checks on the use of such components that do 
not conform to the prescribed standards by manufactures, 
and also stocking / sale by the traders; 
(h) increase in the amount of compensation of the victims of 
hit and run cases;  
(i) removal of time limit for filling of application by road 
accident victims for compensation;  
(j) punishment in case of certain offences is made stringent; 
(k) 
a 
new 
pre-determined 
formula 
for 
payment 
of 
compensation to road accident victims on the basis of 
age/income, which is more liberal and rational.”  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
42. The classes of ‘medium goods vehicle’, ‘medium passenger 
vehicle’, ‘heavy goods vehicles’, and ‘heavy passenger vehicles’ as 
earlier noted in the table, were subsumed under the class of 
‘Transport vehicle’. It can logically be inferred that the term 
‘Transport Vehicle’ primarily targets vehicles exceeding 7,500 kgs, 
for the purpose of license regime. The intention of the legislature 
was to simplify the licensing framework for larger commercial 
vehicles and at the same time not interdict a LMV license holder to 
also drive a transport vehicle. The additional requirements for 
medium and heavy vehicles are also evident from unamended sub-
section 1 of Section 7 which reads as under:  
“Restrictions on the granting of learner’s license for certain 
vehicles- 
(1) No person shall be granted a learner’s license- 
(a) to drive a heavy goods vehicle unless he has held a driving license 
for atleast 2 years to drive a light motor vehicle or for at least one 
year to drive a medium goods vehicle. 

Page 52 of 126 
 
(b) to drive a medium goods vehicle or a medium passenger vehicle 
unless he has held a driving license for atleast one year to drive a 
light motor vehicle.” 
[emphasis supplied] 
43. The amended Section 7(1) however, states that: 
 ‘7. Restrictions on the granting of learner’s licences for 
certain vehicles:- 
[(1) No person shall be granted a learner's licence to drive a 
transport vehicle unless he has held a driving licence to 
drive a light motor vehicle for at least one year:]  
Therefore, the classes of medium and heavy vehicles stood 
subsumed under ‘transport vehicles’. Our view on the LMV licence 
holder's capability to drive a transport vehicle is also fortified by 
the unamended and amended Rule 10 of the MV Rules: 
Rule 10(pre-amendment) 
Rule 10 (post-amendment) 
“10. Application for learner's

44. The insertion of a separate class of ‘Transport Vehicle’ has led 
to some confusion in legal interpretation. In National Insurance Co. 
Ltd. v. Annappa Irappa Nesaria 31  (for short “Annappa Irappa 
Nesaria”), the issue before this Court was whether the driver of a 
Matador van weighing 3,500 kgs which had a ‘goods carriage’ 
permit could drive a ‘transport vehicle’, if he had a LMV license. 
The van, which was insured by the appellant, met with an accident 
on 9.12.1999, causing the death of respondent's wife. It was 
brought to the notice of the Court that the 1994 amendment to the 
MV Act, replaced "medium goods vehicle" and "heavy goods 
vehicle", with "transport vehicle." The 2-judge bench observed as 
under: 
“19. “Light motor vehicle” is defined in Section 2(21) and, 
therefore, in view of the provision, as then existed, it 
included a light transport vehicle. xx 
20. From what has been noticed hereinbefore, it is evident 
that “transport vehicle” has now been substituted for 
“medium goods vehicle” and “heavy goods vehicle”. The light 
motor vehicle continued, at the relevant point of time to cover 
 
31 (2008) 3 SCC 464 

Page 54 of 126 
 
both “light passenger carriage vehicle” and “light goods 
carriage vehicle”. A driver who had a valid licence to drive a 
light motor vehicle, therefore, was authorised to drive a light 
goods vehicle as well.” 
 
 
 
 
 
            [emphasis supplied] 
44.1. In the pertinent judgment, this Court held that the 
amendments carried out in 1994 had a prospective operation and 
at the time of the accident (pre-amendment), a driver holding a 
valid license to drive a ‘Light Motor Vehicle’ was also authorised to 
drive a ‘light goods vehicle’. However, post-amendment, a separate 
endorsement would be necessary. Thus, the insurance company 
was held liable to remit the compensation since the accident 
occurred before the change in law.  
44.2. The above interpretation on prospective application in the 
context of the 1994 amendment, however does not seem to be 
correct since the mention of the term 'Transport Vehicle', does not 
exclude transport vehicles that are already classified as 'LMV', 
under Section 10. If this interpretation were accepted, it would 
imply that medium or heavy vehicles would no longer require 
‘specific’ endorsements, as those classes were removed by the 
amendment. This would lead to impractical outcomes.  
44.3. 
The contention that since Light Motor Vehicles and 
Transport Vehicles are mentioned separately, those Transport 

Page 55 of 126 
 
Vehicles which (weighing less than 7,500 kg) fall within the class 
of LMV would require the driver to have a separate driving license 
or an endorsement does not appeal well to our understanding.  
This would be contrary to the legislative intent. The classes 
mentioned therein do not appear like watertight compartments 
and some degree of overlap is discernible. An LMV license which 
typically covers two-wheelers may also be used for commercial 
activities like small-scale deliveries and the driver may not be 
required to obtain a separate endorsement for the ‘Transport 
Vehicle’ class. It is difficult to accept the argument that a driving 
license issued for a particular class is limited and the intention of 
the legislature was to exclude the Transport Vehicles falling within 
the LMV class.  According to our understanding, the correct way 
to view the legal implication would be that ‘transport vehicles’ 
mentioned in Section 10 would cover only those vehicles whose 
gross vehicle weight is above 7,500 kgs.  Such an interpretation 
aligns with the broader purpose of the amendments and ensures 
that the licensing regime remains efficient and practical for vehicle 
owners and drivers. We therefore partially overrule the decision in 
Annappa Irappa Nesaria(supra) for the view taken w.r.t the post-
1994 amendment position. 

Page 56 of 126 
 
45.  Significantly, Section 10(2) states that a driving license ‘shall 
also be expressed as entitling the holder to drive a motor vehicle of 
one or more of the following classes’. Therefore, the driver of a ‘Light 
Motor Vehicle’ is not per se disentitled to acquire a license for a 
‘Transport Vehicle’ class, for driving vehicles above the weight of 
7,500 kgs or those classes which do not fall in the definition of 
Light Motor Vehicle under Section 2(21). As rightly noted in 
Mukund Dewangan(supra), Section 10 has to be read with Section 
2(21) which defines a Light Motor Vehicle. 
III. Whether the interpretation in Mukund Devangan(2017) would 
render most provisions of the MV Act and MV Rules otiose? 
46.  For the Insurance Companies, it was argued with much 
emphasis that sole reliance on Section 2(21) r/w Section 10 as held 
in Mukund Dewangan(2017) would render otiose, many provisions 
of the MV Act and this can have far-reaching implications. To 
appreciate this contention, a careful examination of the identified 
provisions is necessary.  Is it correct to say that in order to drive a 
transport vehicle, an LMV license holder will require by law, an 
additional endorsement because the scheme of the Act provides a 
clear distinction between ‘Light Motor Vehicle’ and ‘Transport

Vehicle’? The following table marking the distinction was placed

47. Analysis of the above provisions is now apposite. Chapter II 
addresses ‘Licensing of Drivers of Motor Vehicles’. We have already 
noticed Section 3 earlier that covers the ‘Necessity for Driving 
License’ and specifically mentions ‘Transport Vehicle’. Section 4, in 
sequence, is titled ‘Age limit in connection with driving of motor 
vehicles’. Section 18 referred to in Section 4(2) concerns ‘Driving 
Licenses to drive motor vehicles, belonging to the Central 
Government’. Section 4(2) in its current form reads as under: 
“(1) No person under the age of eighteen years shall drive a 
motor vehicle in any public place: 
Provided that [a motor cycle with engine capacity not 
exceeding 50cc] may be driven in a public place by a person 
after attaining the age of sixteen years. 
(2) Subject to the provisions of section 18, no person under 
the age of twenty years shall drive a transport vehicle in any 
public place. 
(3) No learners licence or driving licence shall be issued to 
any person to drive a vehicle of the class to which he has 

Page 60 of 126 
 
made an application unless he is eligible to drive that class 
of vehicle under this section.” 
   
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
48. Section 5 deals with the ‘Responsibility of owners of motor 
vehicles for contravention of Section 3 and 4’ and declares that: 
“No owner or person in charge of a motor vehicle shall cause 
or permit any person who does not satisfy the provisions of 
section 3 or section 4 to drive the vehicle.” 
49. At this stage, we must also note the penal provisions i.e. 
Section 180 and Section 181 of Chapter XIII which deals with 
‘Offences, Penalties and Procedure’:  
“180. Allowing unauthorised persons to drive vehicles.—
Whenever, being the owner or person in charge of a motor 
vehicle, causes, or permits, any other person who does not 
satisfy the provisions of section 3 or section 4 to drive the 
vehicle shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which 
may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend to 
one thousand rupees, or with both.”  
“181. Driving vehicles in contravention of section 3 or section 4.—
Whoever, drives a motor vehicle in contravention of section 3 
or section 4 shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term 
which may extend to three months, or with fine which may 
extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.” 
 
50. Section 6 deals with ‘Restrictions on the holding of driving 
licenses’ and imposes, inter alia, general restrictions to prevent 
individuals from allowing others to use their driving license. 
Section 7(1) is important and provides that a Learner’s license for 
a transport vehicle can only be issued to a person who has held a 

Page 61 of 126 
 
driving license for a Light Motor Vehicle for atleast one year. The 
amended section reads as under:  
“7. Restrictions on the granting of learner’s licences for 
certain vehicles.— 
[(1) No person shall be granted a learner's licence to drive a 
transport vehicle unless he has held a driving licence to 
drive a light motor vehicle for at least one year:]  
[Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall 
apply to an e-cart or e-rickshaw.]  
(2) No person under the age of eighteen years shall be granted 
a learner’s licence to drive a motor cycle without gear except 
with the consent in writing of the person having the care of 
the person desiring the learner’s licence.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   [emphasis supplied] 
51. Section 8 deals with the ‘Grant of Learner’s license’. The 
requirement of medical certificate is contained in Section 
8(3),Section 15 and Rule 5 of the MV Rules. Sub-section (3) of 
Section 8 as amended mandates that an application for a Learner’s 
License for a Transport Vehicle must be accompanied by a Medical 
Certificate by a registered medical practitioner. However, the 
unamended Section 8 did not mention ‘Transport Vehicle’:  
“—8(1) Any person who is not disqualified under section 4 for 
driving a motor vehicle and who is not for the time being 
disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence may, 
subject to the provisions of section 7, apply to the licensing 
authority having jurisdiction in the area—  
(i) in which he ordinarily resides or carries on business, or 
(ii) in which the school or establishment referred to in section 
12 from where he intends to receive instruction in driving a 
motor vehicle is situate, for the issue to him of a learner’s 
licence.  

Page 62 of 126 
 
(2) Every application under sub-section (1) shall be in such 
form and shall be accompanied by such documents and with 
such fee as may be prescribed by the Central Government. 
(3) Every application under sub-section (1) shall be 
accompanied by a medical certificate in such form as may be 
prescribed by the Central Government and signed by such 
registered medical practitioner, as the State Government or 
any person authorised in this behalf by the State 
Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, 
appoint for this purpose:  
XX]” 
52.  The amended 8(3) reads as under: 
(3) Every application [to drive a transport vehicle 
made]under sub-section (1) shall be accompanied by a 
medical certificate in such form as may be prescribed by the 
Central Government and signed by such registered medical 
practitioner, as the State Government or any person 
authorised in this behalf by the State Government may, by 
notification in the Official Gazette, appoint for this purpose:” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied]  
 
53. Rule 5(1) of the amended MV Rules titled ‘Medical Certificate’ 
reiterates such a requirement. While for other vehicles, there is a 
requirement of a self-declaration of fitness, a Medical certificate by 
a registered Medical practitioner is necessary for driving a 
‘Transport Vehicle’. The unamended Rule 5 which does not 
mention ‘Transport Vehicle’ reads as under:  
“5. “Medical Certificate- Every application for the issue of a 
learner's licence or a driving licence or for making addition 
of another class or description of motor vehicle to a driving 
licence or for renewal of learner license or a driving license, 
shall be accompanied by a medical certificate in Form 1 
issued by a registered medical practitioner referred to in sub-
section (3) of section 8”” 
 

Page 63 of 126 
 
54. The amended Rule 5 is also extracted below: 
“5. Medical Certificate- Every application for the issue of a 
learner's licence or a driving licence or for making addition 
of another class or description of a motor vehicle to a driving 
licence or for renewal of a driving licence to drive a vehicle 
other than a transport vehicle shall be accompanied by a 
self-declaration as to the physical fitness as in Form 1 and 
every such application for a licence to drive a transport 
vehicle shall be accompanied by a medical certificate in 
Form 1-A issued by a registered medical practitioner referred 
to in sub-section (3) of section 8” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
55. Section 15 titled ‘Renewal of driving licenses’, outlines the 
requirements for renewal within the time period provided therein. 
The second proviso to Section 15(1), mandates the requirement of 
a medical certificate for ‘Transport Vehicle’ and for those who are 
above the age of 40 years. The second proviso therein reads as 
under:  
“Provided further that where the application is for the 
renewal of a licence to drive a transport vehicle or where in 
any other case the applicant has attained the age of forty 
years, the same shall be accompanied by a medical certificate 
in the same form and in the same manner as is referred to in 
sub-section (3) of section 8, and the provisions of sub-section 
(4) of section 8 shall, so far as may be, apply in relation to 
every such case as they apply in relation to a learner’s 
licence.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
56. Section 9 titled ‘Grant of driving license’ provides a 
comprehensive procedure for granting driving licenses. Section 
9(1) addresses the jurisdiction involved in the licensing process. 
Under Section 9(2), anyone not disqualified from holding or 

Page 64 of 126 
 
obtaining a driving license may apply, using a form prescribed by 
the Central Government. The applicant must also pass a test as 
specified in Section 9(3). Additionally, for those seeking a 
Transport Vehicle license, Section 9(4) mandates a minimum 
educational qualification set by the Central Government. Section 
9(5) pertains to the requirement for re-taking the test after 7 days. 
Meanwhile, 9(6) states that the test of competence to drive must 
be carried out in a vehicle of the type to which the application 
refers. Section 9(7) deals with disqualification and Section 9(8) 
provides, inter alia, that the licensing authority may refuse to issue 
a licence to a habitual criminal or a habitual drunkard or who is 
habitually addicted to any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance 
or whose license had been revoked earlier. Section 9(4) which is 
relevant for our purpose is extracted below: 
“(4) Where the application is for a licence to drive a transport 
vehicle, no such authorisation shall be granted to any 
applicant unless he possesses such minimum educational 
qualification as may be prescribed by the Central 
Government and a driving certificate issued by a school or 
establishment referred to in section 12.” 
 
 
 
 
 
                   [emphasis supplied] 
57. Rule 17(1)(b) of the MV Rules stipulates that any application 
for adding a class of “Transport Vehicle” to a Driving License must 
be accompanied by a Driving Certificate:   

Page 65 of 126 
 
“17. Addition to driving licence.—(1) An application for the 
addition of another class or description of motor vehicle to 
the driving licence shall be made in [Form 2] to the licensing 
authority and shall be accompanied by— 
(a) an effective learner's licence and driving licence held by 
the applicant; 
(b) the driving certificate in Form 5, in the case of an 
application for addition of a transport vehicle, excluding E-
rickshaw or E-cart.” 
 
 
 
 
 
                [emphasis supplied] 
58. Section 14 of the Motor Vehicles Act outlines the validity period 
of driving licenses, distinguishing between those for ‘transport 
vehicles’ and ‘transport vehicles carrying goods,’ while also 
considering the age of the license holder. According to the 
amended section, individuals under 30 years of age will have their 
license valid until they reach 40 years, while those aged 30 to 49 
will enjoy a 10-year validity period. For individuals aged 50 to 54, 
the license remains valid until they turn 60, and for those aged 55 
and older, the validity is set at 5 years. This framework reflects the 
understanding that driving capabilities and experience may vary 
with age. The relevant part of Section 14 is extracted below:  
         “14. Currency of licences to drive motor vehicles.— 
(1) A learner’s licence issued under this Act shall, subject to 
the other provisions of this Act, be effective for a period of six 
months from the date of issue of the licence.  
(2) A driving licence issued or renewed under this Act shall,— 
(a) in the case of a licence to drive a transport vehicle, be 
effective for a period of three years: 1 *** 2 [Provided that in 

Page 66 of 126 
 
the case of licence to drive a transport vehicle carrying 
goods of dangerous or hazardous nature be effective for a 
period of one year and renewal thereof shall be subject to the 
condition that the driver undergoes one day refresher course 
of the prescribed syllabus; and;]  
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx” 
            
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
59. Rule 10 is titled ‘Application for Learner’s license’. The 
unamended Rule 10 stated as under: 
         “10. Application for learner's licence.— 
An application for the grant of a learner's licence shall be made 
in Form 2 and shall be accompanied by,—  
(a) save as otherwise provided in rule 6, a medical certificate in 
[Form 1-A].  
(b) three copies of the applicant's recent 28 [passport size 
photograph], 
(c) appropriate fee as specified in rule 32,  
[(d) in the case of an application for medium goods vehicle, a 
medium passenger motor vehicle, a heavy goods vehicle or 
a heavy passenger vehicle, the driving license held by the 
applicant.”  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
60. The amended Rule 10 replaces these highlighted terms with 
the single term ‘Transport Vehicle’: 
         10. Application for learner's licence.— 
An application for the grant of a learner's licence shall be made 
in Form 2 and shall be accompanied by,—  
(a) save as otherwise provided in rule 6, a medical certificate in 
[Form 1-A].  
(b) three copies of the applicant's recent 28 [passport size 
photograph], 

Page 67 of 126 
 
 (c) appropriate fee as specified in rule 32,  
 [(d) in the case of an application for transport vehicle 
excluding E-rickshaw or E-Cart, the driving licence held by the 
applicant]  
[(e) proof of residence 
 (f) proof of age” 
 
 
 
 
                               [emphasis supplied] 
61. Section 27 concerns the power of Central Government to make 
Rules. Section 28 which deals with the power of the State 
Government to make rules provides specifically w.r.t. transport 
vehicles in sub-section 2(d) and 2(h) the following :- 
“(d) the badges and uniform to be worn by drivers of 
transport vehicles and the fees to be paid in respect of 
badges” 
(h) the duties, functions and conduct of such persons to 
whom licences to drive transport vehicles are issued 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
62. Rule 31(2) and (3) which deal with the syllabus provides 
as under:  
31. Syllabus for imparting instructions, in driving of motor 
vehicles.— 
(1) The syllabus for imparting instructions in driving of motor 
vehicles of the schools or establishments shall be as follows 
(see tables below):  
[(2) The lessons for training drivers of non-transport 
vehicles shall cover Parts A, B, C, F, G and K of the syllabus 
referred to in sub-rule (1) and the training period shall not 
be less than twenty-one days: Provided that in case of 
motorcycles, it shall be sufficient compliance of the 
provisions, if portion of Part C of syllabus as applicable to 
such vehicles are covered.  

Page 68 of 126 
 
(3) The lessons for training drivers of transport vehicles 
shall cover Parts E, F, G, H, I, J and K of the syllabus referred 
to in sub-rule (1) and the training period shall not be less 
than thirty days” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
63. Chapter V of the MV Act specifically deals with ‘Control of 
Transport Vehicles’.  Section 66 deals with ‘Necessity for Permits’ 
and prohibits an owner of a motor vehicle to use or to permit the 
use of the motor vehicle as a transport vehicle in any public place 
save in accordance with the conditions of permit, granted by an 
appropriate authority: 
“66. Necessity for permits.—(1) No owner of a motor vehicle 
shall use or permit the use of the vehicle as a transport 
vehicle in any public place whether or not such vehicle is 
actually carrying any passengers or goods save in 
accordance with the conditions of a permit granted or 
countersigned by a Regional or State Transport Authority or 
any prescribed authority authorising him the use of the 
vehicle in that place in the manner in which the vehicle is 
being used:…” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
64.  The necessity for a permit and the need for driving license are 
two different requirements and the distinctions thereof must be 
borne in mind.  
65. The aforenoted provisions are pressed into service to contend 
that the legislature has placed LMVs and Transport Vehicles under 
separate classes.  For each class of vehicle, varying degrees of 
scrutiny are provided and the argument on behalf of Insurance 

Page 69 of 126 
 
Companies is that the holder of a LMV license is disentitled to drive 
a Transport Vehicle and a separate endorsement would be 
necessary for driving a vehicle of the other class. 
66. Reading the various provisions as noticed above appears to 
pull the reader into two distinct spheres and this might make the 
legal implications unworkable. The principle of harmonious 
constructions of statutes should guide us to unravel this vexed 
question.  
(a) Harmonious Construction 
67. In Sultana Begum v. Prem Chand Jain32, this Court examined 
the relevant precedents of this Court and articulated the following 
principles on harmonious construction of statutes:  
“a. It is the duty of the courts to avoid a head-on clash 
between two sections of the Act and to construe the 
provisions which appear to be in conflict with each other 
in such a manner as to harmonise them;  
b. The provisions of one section of a statute cannot be 
used to defeat the other provisions unless the court, in 
spite of its efforts, finds it impossible to effect 
reconciliation between them;  
c. When there are two conflicting provisions in an Act, 
which cannot be reconciled with each other, they should 
be so interpreted that, if possible, effect should be given 
to both. This is the essence of the rule of harmonious 
construction;  
d. The courts have also to keep in mind that an 
interpretation which reduces one of the provisions to a 
 
32 1997 (1) SCC 373 

Page 70 of 126 
 
“dead letter” or “useless lumber” is not harmonious 
construction; and  
e. To harmonize is not to destroy any statutory provision or 
to render it otiose.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
68.  Keeping the above principles in mind, let us proceed further. 
The relevant provisions of the MV Act and the MV Rules would 
show that the term ‘Transport Vehicle’ is frequently referenced in 
various Sections and Rules. Most of these provisions were not 
noticed in Mukund Dewangan(2017). It is true that the legislature 
has imposed additional requirements for ‘Transport Vehicles’.  
But should it be enough to say that a ‘Light Motor Vehicle’ license 
holder is legally incapable of driving a transport vehicle although 
its gross vehicle weight is below 7500 kg, as is suggested by the 
counsel for the insurance companies? In our view, such a manner 
of interpretation would render superfluous and otiose the precise 
and compact definition of LMV given in Section 2(21) which so 
significantly uses the expression ‘means’. When questions on  the 
relevance of Section 2(21) was raised, the following points were 
made:-  
         (a)   Section 2(21) which includes Transport Vehicles is for 
a different regime, set under Section 113 which places 
limitation both on weight and usage of the vehicle.  Section 

Page 71 of 126 
 
115 empowers the authority to restrict the driving of any 
vehicle of a specified class or description.  These sections 
are contained in Chapter VII which is titled ‘Control of 
Traffic’ and pertain to ‘limits of weight and limitations on 
use’ and ‘power to restrict the use of vehicles’.  Vehicles of 
specific weight may be prohibited from certain roads or 
areas making weight a relevant factor. Under the said 
definition of LMV, ‘weight’ has been kept as a factor for 
demarcation between ‘LMV’ and ‘Transport’ vehicles 
primarily for the purposes of determining the ‘road tax’.  
(b) Section 41(4) outlines the necessity of specifying the 
exact type of vehicle—including its design, construction, 
and intended use—during the registration process. It was 
contended that this is where weight becomes a critical 
factor. 
(c) Weight is considered in Section 44(ae) of the Income Tax 
Act 1961, which concerns incomes derived from transport 
vehicles.  
69. The above submissions which mention the weight of the 
vehicle are in different context and can’t be used to render section 
2(21) i.e. the definition, a dead letter. If the definition clause was 

Page 72 of 126 
 
worded differently, one might possibly  argue that a distinction 
could be made between Transport Vehicles and LMVs. But the use 
of the word ‘means’, points towards the categorical intent of the 
legislature. When a Court is faced with two interpretations, one of 
which would have the effect of rendering a provision a ‘dead letter’, 
the interpretation that allows for such violence to the key words 
in the statute must be avoided. An attempt at harmonization 
would therefore be in order. Let us analyse the issue further by 
considering the following overlapping diagram: 
 
70.  The above illustration indicates that all Transport Vehicles 
are not Light Motor Vehicles but some may fall within the class of 
LMVs which is represented by the overlapping section.  The 
inference therefore is that if the transport vehicle falls under the 
definition of Light Motor Vehicle in Section 2(21), the additional 
requirements as outlined in the provisions noticed above, need 
not be satisfied by a person holding a driving licence for a ‘Light 
Motor Vehicle’ class. Consequently, a separate endorsement of a 

Page 73 of 126 
 
Transport Vehicle is not necessary as the LMV license would 
suffice for vehicles below 7500 kg weight. Such an interpretation 
would harmonize the statutory provisions by requiring the 
additional factors only for those Transport vehicles whose gross 
weight exceeds 7500 kg. 
71. It was additionally argued that the principle of generalia 
specialibus non derogant would apply in this case. Section 2(21) 
is a general provision defining a Light Motor Vehicle which 
includes a ‘Transport Vehicle,’ whereas Section 3 is a specific 
provision that prohibits driving a ‘transport vehicle’ without a 
separate license endorsement. According to Mr. Jayant Bhushan, 
Section 3 should take precedence, requiring a separate 
endorsement under the ‘Transport Vehicle’ class.  
72. To address the argument, let us consider the following 
passage by Lord Herschell LC in Institute of Patent Agents & Ors. 
v. Joseph Lockwood33 : 
 “Well, there is a conflict sometimes between two sections to 
be found in the same Act. You have to try and reconcile them 
as best you may. If you cannot, you have to determine which 
is the leading provision and which the subordinate provision, 
and which must give way to the other.”  
 
33 1894 A.C. 347 at 360 

Page 74 of 126 
 
73. The important thing to note is that one provision must give 
way to the other only when reconciliation is not possible. However, 
when it is possible to harmonize the two, the Court need not 
determine which is the leading provision.  As regards the 
argument of rendering second part of Section 3(1) otiose, let us 
again notice Section 3:  
“3. Necessity for driving licence.—(1) No person shall drive a 
motor vehicle in any public place unless he holds an effective 
driving licence issued to him authorising him to drive the 
vehicle; and no person shall so drive a transport vehicle 
(other than a motor cab or motorcycle hired for his own use or 
rented under any scheme made under sub-section (2) of 
Section 75) unless his driving licence specifically entitles 
him so to do.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
74.  Section 3 refers to ‘Transport Vehicles’, like many other 
provisions in the MV Act and the MV Rules. Section 3 cannot 
however be construed as a special provision that would override 
the strict and emphatic definition of LMV, given in Section 2(21) 
and the separate class of ‘Light Motor Vehicle’ provided in Section 
10.  Section 2(21) uses the term ‘means’ as earlier emphasized 
and there is an affirmation of certainty in the wordings of the 
definition and it is to be recognized sensu stricto in a technical 
sense and must not be understood loosely.  To say that Section 3 
would disentitle the LMV license holders to drive transport 

Page 75 of 126 
 
vehicles of the permissible weight category, would be incompatible 
and would render the strict definition clause, sterile and a ‘dead 
letter’.  A harmonious construction of both sections can however 
reach us to a conclusion that for LMV licence holders, a separate 
endorsement 
under 
‘Transport 
Vehicle’ 
class 
would 
be 
unnecessary for driving LMV class of vehicles.  In our 
interpretation and understanding, it would be logical to hold that 
the additional licensing requirements will have no application for 
the LMV class of  vehicles but will be needed only for such 
‘Transport Vehicles’, which by virtue of their gross weight fall in 
the Medium and Heavy category. Such a construction would also 
fulfill the legislative purpose which is to ensure road safety by 
requiring only those individuals who intend to operate medium 
and heavy vehicles, to satisfy the additional licensing criteria.In 
our view, the age restrictions outlined in Section 4, the 
requirement of a medical certificate, and the criteria under 
Section 7 should reasonably apply only for the medium and heavy 
transport vehicles whose gross weight will be above 7500 Kg.  
Such an interpretation would fulfill the objective of the MV Act to 
provide compensation to victims of road accidents while 
maintaining a commensurate licensing regime for drivers.    

Page 76 of 126 
 
75. At this stage, it needs to be borne in mind that the genesis of 
the present reference arises from compensation claims. A reference 
to the judgment in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Swaran Singh34 
may therefore be apposite.  A 3-judge bench of this Court noted 
that the liability of the insurance company in relation to the owner 
depends on several factors. The issue of lack of valid driving license 
was discussed as under:  
“7. If a person has been given a licence for a particular type 
of vehicle as specified therein, he cannot be said to have no 
licence for driving another type of vehicle which is of the 
same category but of different type. As for example, when a 
person is granted a licence for driving a light motor vehicle, 
he can drive either a car or a jeep and it is not necessary that 
he must have driving licence both for car and jeep separately. 
89. Section 3 of the Act casts an obligation on a driver to hold 
an effective driving licence for the type of vehicle which he 
intends to drive. Section 10 of the Act enables the Central 
Government to prescribe forms of driving licences for various 
categories of vehicles mentioned in sub-section (2) of the said 
section. The various types of vehicles described for which a 
driver may obtain a licence for one or more of them are: (a) 
motorcycle without gear, (b) motorcycle with gear, (c) invalid 
carriage, (d) light motor vehicle, (e) transport vehicle, (f) road 
roller, and (g) motor vehicle of other specified description. 
The definition clause in Section 2 of the Act defines various 
categories of vehicles which are covered in broad types 
mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 10. They are “goods 
carriage”, “heavy goods vehicle”, “heavy passenger motor 
vehicle”, “invalid carriage”, “light motor vehicle”, “maxi-cab”, 
“medium goods vehicle”, “medium passenger motor vehicle”, 
“motor-cab”, “motorcycle”, “omnibus”, “private service 
vehicle”, “semi-trailer”, “tourist vehicle”, “tractor”, “trailer” 
 
34 (2004) 3 SCC 297 

Page 77 of 126 
 
and “transport vehicle”. In claims for compensation for 
accidents, various kinds of breaches with regard to the 
conditions of driving licences arise for consideration before 
the Tribunal as a person possessing a driving licence for 
“motorcycle without gear”, [sic may be driving a vehicle] for 
which he has no licence. Cases may also arise where a holder 
of driving licence for “light motor vehicle” is found to be 
driving a “maxi-cab”, “motor-cab” or “omnibus” for which he 
has no licence. In each case, on evidence led before the 
Tribunal, a decision has to be taken whether the fact of the 
driver possessing licence for one type of vehicle but found 
driving another type of vehicle, was the main or contributory 
cause of accident. If on facts, it is found that the accident 
was caused solely because of some other unforeseen or 
intervening causes like mechanical failures and similar other 
causes having no nexus with the driver not possessing 
requisite type of licence, the insurer will not be allowed to 
avoid its liability merely for technical breach of 
conditions concerning driving licence. 
90. We have construed and determined the scope of sub-
clause (ii) of sub-section (2) of Section 149 of the Act. Minor 
breaches of licence conditions, such as want of medical 
fitness certificate, requirement about age of the driver 
and the like not found to have been the direct cause of 
the accident, would be treated as minor breaches of 
inconsequential deviation in the matter of use of 
vehicles. Such minor and inconsequential deviations with 
regard to licensing conditions would not constitute sufficient 
ground to deny the benefit of coverage of insurance to the 
third parties.” 
 
  
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
 
76. The upshot of the above is that compensation must not be 
denied for minor technical breaches of the licensing conditions. It 
was submitted before this Court that the decision in Mukund 
Dewangan(2017) is per incuriam for not considering Para 89 of the 

Page 78 of 126 
 
judgment. It is true that the Court pertinently notes therein that 
“Cases may also arise where a holder of driving licence for “light 
motor vehicle” is found to be driving a “maxi-cab”, “motor-cab” or 
“omnibus” for which he has no licence.” However, such an 
observation cannot be considered a conclusive determination by 
the Court to hold that a separate license for each of these vehicles 
would be necessary. Therefore, we are disinclined to accept such 
an argument.    
b) Interpretation must not result in impractical outcomes 
 
77. It is well-settled that a statute should be interpreted in a 
manner that avoids leading to unworkable or impractical 
outcomes 35 . If a statutory interpretation results in confusion, 
impracticability or creates burden that the legislature could not 
have intended, such an interpretation should be avoided. Mr. 
Jayant Bhushan, Learned Senior Counsel, placed reliance on 
Section 9(6) of MV Act and Rule 15(2) of MV Rules to argue that if 
one wants an endorsement of a ‘transport vehicle’ class, the 
person has to be tested on a ‘transport vehicle’ and not a ‘Maruti-
800 car’.  Let us test this argument by again taking the 
hypothetical example of Sri who holds an LMV license and is 
 
35 Madan and Co. v. Wazir Jaivir Chand, (1989) 1 SCC 264 

Page 79 of 126 
 
desirous of operating an auto for commercial purposes and as 
such applies separately for a license of a ‘Transport Vehicle’ class.  
Crucially, Section 9 dealing with ‘Grant of driving license’ provides 
in sub-section (6) as under: 
“(6) The test of competence to drive shall be carried out in a 
vehicle of the type to which the application refers:” 
78. Sub-section (2) of Rule 15 of MV Rules titled ‘Driving Test’ 
read thus: 
“(2) The test of competence to drive referred to in sub-section 
(3) of section 9 shall be conducted by the licensing authority 
or such other person as may be authorised in this behalf by 
the State Government in a vehicle of the type to which the 
application relates.” 
79. The type of the vehicle referred above, under the ‘Transport 
Vehicle’ class could therefore either be a three-wheeler weighing 
less than 7,500 kgs or a heavy passenger vehicle of more than 
12,000 kgs, if the class for which Sri applied is broadly taken as 
a ‘transport Vehicle’, with no distinction between heavy, medium 
or light category.  Then our hypothetical driver Sri, although will 
be tested to drive an ‘auto’, could end up driving a heavy 
passenger vehicle using the  ‘Transport Vehicle’ license. Such a 
conclusion on valid authority would be incompatible in the 
context.    

Page 80 of 126 
 
80. Let us also look at the syllabus that would be prescribed for 
Sri for his application to drive a ‘Transport Vehicle’. As noted 
earlier, for ‘Transport Vehicles’, the syllabus as per Rule 31 is 
contained in Part E,F,G,H,I,J and K:  
Part A: Driving Theory-I 
Part B: Traffic Education-I 
Part C: Light Vehicles Driving Practice 
Part D: Vehicle Mechanism and Repairs 
Part E: Medium and Heavy Vehicle Driving: Driving Theory-II 
Part F: Traffic Education—II 
Part G. Public Relations For Drivers 
Part H. Heavy Vehicle Driving Practice 
Part I. Fire Hazards 
Part J. Vehicle Maintenance 
Part K. First Aid 
the syllabus is contained in Part E,F,G,H,I,J and K:  
81. Our hypothetical Sri, who wants to drive an auto would then 
be imparted training for the syllabus outlined in Parts E, F, G, H, 
I, J & K. These parts primarily pertain to ‘Medium and Heavy 
Vehicle Driving’.  The extensive syllabus covers topics such as fire 
hazards, heavy vehicle maintenance, cross-country practice and 
hill driving but those would hardly be germane for Sri who is 
desirous of driving only an auto rickshaw falling within the Light 

Page 81 of 126 
 
Motor Vehicle class.  The legislature in its wisdom had stipulated 
such a wide-ranging syllabus to augment the safety measures as 
considered apposite for operating medium and heavy motor 
vehicles.  To apply this extensive level of learning for the auto 
driver Sri, would defy logic although auto is a ‘transport vehicle’ 
but of a light weight class.  To avoid such an illogical outcome, the 
argument of Mr. Bhushan has to be rejected. It would therefore 
be appropriate to interpret the provision to declare that the 
additional requirements outlined in the MV Act for ‘Transport 
Vehicle’, would not cover the LMV class but would be applicable 
only for the heavy and medium class vehicles. Such an 
interpretation would align with our harmonious interpretation, as 
explained earlier. If the alternate interpretation as suggested by 
the counsel for the insurance companies is accepted, it would 
mean that Sri’s driving skills may be tested on an autorickshaw 
but he would also be legally entitled to drive a heavy multi axle 
truck because of the broad class of ‘Transport Vehicle’. Such an 
absurd result should not be permitted.   
82. The requirement of uniforms and badges for ‘transport vehicle’ 
and the duties and conduct of such persons under Section 
28(2)(d) and 28(2)(h) are not directly related to the licensing 
regime. Similarly misplaced here is the reliance on necessity for 

Page 82 of 126 
 
Permit under Section 66 as also Rule 62 dealing with the 
‘Certificate of Fitness’ of the vehicle. Rule 62 is extracted:-  
“62. Validity of certificate of fitness.—(1) A certificate of 
fitness in respect of a transport vehicle granted under 
section 56 shall be in Form 38 and such certificate when 
granted or renewed shall be valid for the period as indicated 
below:— 
(a) new transport vehicle 
Two years 
(b) renewal of certificate of 
fitness 
in 
respect 
of 
vehicles mentioned in {a) 
above 
One year 
[(ba) renewal of certificate 
of fitness in respect of E-
rickshaw and E-cart 
Three years 
renewal of certificate of 
fitness 
in 
respect 
of 
vehicles 
covered 
under 
rule 82 of these rules 
One year 
d) fresh registration of 
important vehicles 
same period as in the case of 
vehicles 
manufactured 
in 
India having regard to the 
date of manufacture:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
83. The apprehension about a person with a license of a light 
motor vehicle class being able to drive an e-rickshaw, e-cart, a 
vehicle carrying hazardous goods or even a road roller is also 
misplaced. This is for the reason that legislature has carved out 
exceptions for these special kinds of vehicles in the MV Act and 
the MV Rules which is discernible from the following:.  

Page 83 of 126 
 
(i) Section 28 deals with the power of State Government to make 
Rules. Clause (h) provides for “the exemption of drivers of road 
rollers from all or any of the provisions of this Chapter or of the 
rules made thereunder” 
(ii) An exception is carved out in Section 7, 9 and 27 of MV Act for 
e-cart or e-rickshaw. For instance, the proviso to Section 7 states 
that “Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply 
to an e-cart or e-rickshaw”. 
(iii) Similarly, Rule 8A provides for minimum training for driving 
E-rickshaw 
or 
E-cart. 
Rule 
9 
provides 
for 
educational 
qualifications for drivers of goods carriage carrying dangerous or 
hazardous goods.     
Therefore, the present interpretation will not have any impact for 
such vehicles.  
84. It was also argued that the form of the driving license 
provides for the validity period for ‘Transport’ and ‘Non Transport 
Vehicle’. On this contention, we can benefit by the following words 
of Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy in Life Insurance Corporation v. 

Page 84 of 126 
 
Escorts36, where for a similar insistence on form, the Judge opined 
as under:- 
"Surely, the Form cannot control the Act, the Rules or the 
directions. As one learned Judge of the Madras High Court 
was fond of saying it is the dog that wags the tail and not the 
tail that wags the dog. We may add what this Court had 
occasion to say in Vasudev Ramchandra Shelat v. Pranlal 
Jayanand Thakar, [(1975) 1 S.C.R. 534 :AIR 1974 SC 1728 : 
1974 (2) SCC 323 : 1975 (45) Com. Cas. 43.] : 
 "The subservience of substance of a transaction to some 
rigidly prescribed form required to be meticulously observed, 
sevours of archaic and outmoded jurisprudence."  
 
85. A harmonious interpretation of various sections would lead 
us to conclude that a person holding a LMV license is equally 
competent to drive a Transport Vehicle, provided of course the 
vehicle’s gross weight does not exceed 7,500 kgs. The reference to 
‘transport vehicle’ in Section 3(1) and other sections of the Act and 
Rules should therefore be understood as applying to only those 
vehicles which fall beyond the scope of the sensu stricto definition, 
under Section 2(21). This interpretation would ensure that no 
provision or word is rendered otiose and the licensing regime 
remains 
coherent 
with 
the 
legislative 
intent. 
Such 
an 
interpretation would also avoid illogical outcomes as discussed 
above.

V. Discussion on the 8 Conflicting decisions 
86. The legal landscape surrounding the issue of whether a driver 
holding a license for a ‘Light motor vehicle’ can operate a 
‘Transport Vehicle’ without obtaining a specific endorsement has 
been marked by a myriad of conflicting judgments. The genesis of 
the present reference stems from eight conflicting decisions which 
were thereafter referred to a 3-judge bench in Mukund 
Dewangan(2017). On the issue of Transport Vehicles of the LMV 
class being driven by a driver with a LMV License, in the event of 
an accident involving an insured vehicle, some opinions have held 
the insurance company liable to pay compensation while few 
others have noted that the driver did not have a valid license for a 
‘transport vehicle’ although he was possessing a LMV license.  On 
a few occasions, this Court had exercised its power under Article 
142 to grant compensation despite noting that the driver did not 
possess a valid ‘transport vehicle’ license. Before proceeding any 
further, a short discussion of these decisions in chronological 
order would be appropriate for aiding clarity to the discussion.  
87. The earliest decision on the issue was in 1999, in Ashok 
Gangadhar Maratha v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. 37 (for short 
 
37 (1999) 6 SCC 620 

Page 86 of 126 
 
“Ashok Gangadhar Maratha”). The definition of LMV at that time 
stipulated a weight limit of 6000 kgs. The facts in that case was 
that the appellant who was the holder of a LMV license, owned a 
Swaraj Mazda truck weighing 5,920 kgs, which got damaged in an 
accident on 26.11.1991. When the insurer refuted the claim, 
questioning the validity of the LMV driving license, the appellant 
filed a complaint before the Consumer Forum. The case traveled to 
the Supreme Court where a two-judge bench of this Court 
pertinently observed that a holder of a LMV license can drive a 
‘transport 
vehicle’, 
without 
a 
specific 
endorsement 
and 
accordingly, compensation was granted to the claimants. The 
Supreme Court, inter alia, gave an important interpretation to 
Section 2(21) of the MV Act as well as Rule 2(e) of the MV Rules 
which defines a “non-transport vehicle”. In Para 10, the Court 
pertinently observed as under:  
“10. The definition of “light motor vehicle” as given in clause 
(21) of Section 2 of the Act can apply only to a “light goods 
vehicle” or a “light transport vehicle”. A “light motor vehicle” 
otherwise has to be covered by the definition of “motor 
vehicle” or “vehicle” as given in clause (28) of Section 2 of the 
Act. A light motor vehicle cannot always mean a light goods 
carriage. Light motor vehicle can be a non-transport vehicle 
as well.” 
88. The Court supplemented its reasoning in Para 11 as under:  

Page 87 of 126 
 
“11. To reiterate, since a vehicle cannot be used as a 
transport vehicle on a public road unless there is a permit 
issued by the Regional Transport Authority for that purpose 
and since in the instant case there is neither a pleading to 
that effect by any party nor is there any permit on record, the 
vehicle in question would remain a light motor vehicle. The 
respondent also does not say that any permit was granted to 
the appellant for plying the vehicle as a transport vehicle 
under Section 66 of the Act. Moreover, on the date of the 
accident, the vehicle was not carrying any goods and though 
it could be said to have been designed to be used as a 
transport vehicle or a goods carrier, it cannot be so held on 
account of the statutory prohibition contained in Section 66 
of the Act.” 
89. The Court additionally noted that if one accepts the contention 
of the insurer, “there can never be any light motor vehicle and 
there can never be any driving licence for driving a light motor 
vehicle. We cannot put such a construction on clause (21) of 
Section 2 of the Act so as to exclude a light motor vehicle from the 
Act altogether.” 
89.1. 
Looking at the scheme of the MV Act, the above 
conclusion was the correct one declaring that an LMV would 
include a ‘light good vehicle’ or a ‘light transport vehicle’. While the 
Court supplemented its reasoning by stating that a vehicle cannot 
be used as a transport vehicle on a public road unless there is a 
permit, we must understand that a ‘license’ is different from a 
‘permit’. The observations of the Court on the legal issue of a 
driving license, aligns with our own interpretation.   

Page 88 of 126 
 
90. In Nagashetty v United India Insurance Co 38 , the vehicle 
involved was a tractor with a trailer attached, filled with stones. 
The case revolved around an accident that occurred on 4.12.1995, 
when a tractor driven by the driver lost control and hit two 
pedestrians, resulting in the death of one person. The LRs of the 
deceased filed a compensation claim before the Motor Accident 
Claims Tribunal (MACT), which ruled in their favor and awarded 
compensation of ₹2,07,000 making the Insurance company liable 
for the insured tractor. The Insurance Company appealed before 
the High Court, contending that the driver only had a licence to 
operate a tractor and not a ‘goods vehicle’, as a trailer filled with 
stones was attached to the tractor, classifying it as a ‘transport 
vehicle’. Deciding in favour of the Insurance Company, the High 
Court held that the licence was invalid for driving a ‘transport 
vehicle’, and therefore, the Insurance Company was not liable to 
pay the compensation to the claimants.  
90.1. Setting aside the decision of the High Court, the Supreme 
Court held that a person having a valid driving license to drive a 
particular category of vehicle, does not become unauthorised to 
drive that category of vehicle, merely because a trailer is attached 
 
38 (2001) 8 SCC 56 

Page 89 of 126 
 
to it. Interpreting the terms of the Insurance Policy, it was held 
that if the submission of the Insurance Co. is accepted, then every 
time, an owner of a private car, who has a license to drive an LMV, 
attaches a roof carrier to his car, and carries goods thereon, the 
LMV would become a Transport Vehicle, and the owner would then 
be deemed to have no valid license, to drive that vehicle.  
90.2. It was rightly held in the above decision and as noted in 
Mukund Dewangan(2017), that a vehicle cannot be readily 
classified as a ‘transport vehicle’ requiring a separate endorsement 
in the driving license.  Although the Court supported its reasoning 
by referencing the insurance policy terms, the legal position 
remains that the term ‘transport vehicle’ overlaps with other 
vehicle classes. 
91. Before this Court, reliance was placed on the judgment in New 
India Assurance Company v Prabhu Lal39(for short “Prabhu Lal”).  
The decision would now require our careful consideration. In this 
case, the accident which occurred on 17.4.1998 involved a 
Roadways bus (weighing 4,100 kgs) which was being driven by one 
M. This was however disputed by the insurance company who 
claimed that the vehicle was driven by the complainant’s own 
 
39 (2008) 1 SCC 696 

Page 90 of 126 
 
brother, who held a ‘Light Motor Vehicle’ license but not a 
‘transport vehicle’ license.  The District Forum held that a “goods 
carrier” weighing 4,100 kgs defined under Section 2(14) of the MV 
Act was driven by an individual with a LMV license and hence this 
was a Transport Vehicle under Section 2(47) of the MV Act for 
which, a separate endorsement was necessary. The State 
Commission however held that the principle laid down in the 1999 
decision in Ashok Gangadhar(supra) would apply and since the 
gross weight of the vehicle was only 6,800 kgs, it did not exceed 
the permissible limits for LMV category vehicles. Accordingly, the 
Insurance company was held liable. The National Commission 
upheld the said decision of the State Commission, favouring the 
claimants.  
91.1. Reversing the concurrent decisions of the State and National 
Commissions, the Supreme Court however restored the decision of 
the District Forum which held that at the time of the accident, 
complainant’s brother was driving the insured vehicle.  On the 
validity of the LMV driving license holder driving the bus weighing 
4100 kg, this Court held that a separate endorsement was 
necessary to drive the Transport Vehicle. It was observed as under: 
“33. In our considered view, the State Commission was 
wrong in reversing the finding recorded by the District 

Page 91 of 126 
 
Forum. So far as Ashok Gangadhar [(1999) 6 SCC 620 : 
1999 SCC (Cri) 1170] is concerned, we will deal with the 
said decision little later but from the documentary 
evidence on record and particularly, from the permit 
issued by the Transport Authority, it is amply clear that 
the vehicle was a “goods carrier” [Section 2(14)]. If it is so, 
obviously, it was a “transport vehicle” falling under Clause 
(47) of Section 2 of the Act. The District Forum was, 
therefore, right in considering the question of liability of 
the Insurance Company on the basis that Tata 709 which 
met with an accident was “transport vehicle”. 
91.2. The Court in Para 40 and Para 41 also distinguished the 
1999 judgement in Ashok Gangadhar Maratha(supra) with the 
following discussion: 
“40. It is no doubt true that in Ashok Gangadhar [(1999) 6 
SCC 620 : 1999 SCC (Cri) 1170] in spite of the fact that 
the driver was holding valid driving licence to ply light 
motor vehicle (LMV), this Court upheld the claim and 
ordered the Insurance Company to pay compensation. 
But, in our considered opinion, the learned counsel for the 
Insurance Company is right in submitting that it was 
because of the fact that there was neither pleading nor 
proof as regards the permit issued by the Transport 
Authority. In absence of pleading and proof, this Court 
held that, it could not be said that the driver had no valid 
licence to ply the vehicle which met with an accident and 
he could not be deprived of the compensation. This is clear 
if one reads para 11 of the judgment, which reads thus: 
(SCC p. 626) 
“11. To reiterate, since a vehicle cannot be used 
as a transport vehicle on a public road unless 
there is a permit issued by the Regional Transport 
Authority for that purpose and since in the instant 
case there is neither a pleading to that effect by 
any party nor is there any permit on record, the 
vehicle in question would remain a light motor 
vehicle. The respondent also does not say that 
any permit was granted to the appellant for 
plying the vehicle as a transport vehicle under 
Section 66 of the Act. Moreover, on the date of 
the accident, the vehicle was not carrying any 

Page 92 of 126 
 
goods and though it could be said to have been 
designed to be used as a transport vehicle or a 
goods carrier, it cannot be so held on account of 
the statutory prohibition contained in Section 
66 of the Act.” 
41. In our judgment, Ashok Gangadhar [(1999) 6 SCC 620 
: 1999 SCC (Cri) 1170] did not lay down that the driver 
holding licence to drive a light motor vehicle need not have 
an endorsement to drive transport vehicle and yet he can 
drive such vehicle. It was on the peculiar facts of the case, 
as the Insurance Company neither pleaded nor proved that 
the vehicle was transport vehicle by placing on record the 
permit issued by the Transport Authority that the 
Insurance Company was held liable.” 
 
91.3. In Prabhu Lal (supra), this Court correctly noted that the 
vehicle was a ‘goods carrier’ under Section 2(14) and fell within the 
definition of ‘transport vehicle’. But then it strikingly overlooked 
that a ‘transport vehicle’ below 7500 kg unladen weight, would also 
be covered within the definition of LMV, under Section 2(21). This 
vital aspect was not discussed and the definition of Section 2(21) 
was also not adverted to in the judgment. The relevant portion of 
Ashok Gangadhar Maratha(supra) where it was held that the 
definition of ‘light motor vehicle’ can apply to ‘light goods vehicle’ 
as well as a ‘light transport vehicle’, was also overlooked. Instead 
the Court distinguished the judgment in Ashok Gangadhar 
Maratha(supra) on the basis of evidence and pleadings in that case. 
We have already noted earlier that the reasoning in Ashok 
Gangadhar Maratha(supra) w.r.t evidence and pleadings was only 

Page 93 of 126 
 
an additional observation. We must not confuse ‘permit’ with a 
‘driving license’ to drive a ‘Transport Vehicle’. The Supreme Court 
in Prabhu Lal(supra) should have followed the decision in Ashok 
Gangadhar Maratha(supra) which clearly stated the legal position 
that a ‘light motor vehicle’ would include a ‘light goods vehicle’.     
92. The issue in Annappa Irappa Nesaria(supra), as we have 
already discussed in Part III of the judgment, was whether a driver 
of a Matador van weighing 3,500 kgs, with a "goods carriage" 
permit, could drive a "transport vehicle" with just a LMV license. 
The van met with an accident before the 1994 amendments to the 
MV Act, when there was no separate class for "transport vehicle." 
The Court ruled that since the accident occurred before the 
amendment, the driver’s LMV license was valid for the transport 
vehicle, and the insurance company was liable to pay 
compensation. However, the Court held that post-amendment, a 
separate endorsement for driving transport vehicles is required. 
We are disinclined to accept such a view as we have already 
discussed in our judgment earlier that both before and after the 
1994 amendment, the enhanced requirements for ‘Transport 
Vehicles’ applied primarily for medium and heavy vehicles, 
particularly following the 1994 amendment. We have also 
discussed the unworkability of the broad class of ‘Transport 

Page 94 of 126 
 
Vehicles’ and the inconsistency this creates with the other 
provisions of the MV Act and MV Rules, if such an interpretation 
is adopted.  
93. In New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v Roshanben Rahemansha 
Fakir 40  (for short “Roshanben Rahemansha Fakir), the case 
involved an autorickshaw, classified as a three-wheeled transport 
vehicle, used for goods delivery. In this case, insurance company 
resisted the accident claim and argued that the driver did not have 
a valid driving licence for a ‘transport vehicle’. The Supreme Court 
however reversed the decision of the Gujarat High Court and the 
MACT  and noted that under Section 14(2)(a) of the MV Act, the 
renewal period for Transport Vehicle licences is three years, 
compared to twenty years for other vehicle categories. Based on 
this reasoning, the Court held that the driver was not authorised 
to drive the autorickshaw as he lacked the appropriate 
endorsement on his LMV License. 
93.1. The above faulty conclusion was reached primarily because 
the Court failed to take into account Section 2(21), which defines 
a Light Motor Vehicle (LMV). Since an autorickshaw falls within 
the weight limit of an LMV, the driver’s LMV licence should have 
 
40 (2008) 8 SCC 253 

Page 95 of 126 
 
been deemed sufficient. The presumption on account of the validity 
of license for 20 years could be relevant only for such vehicles 
which are covered within Medium or Heavy categories.  
94. In Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Angad Kol41(for short “Angad 
Kol”), the legal heirs of the deceased victim filed claim before the 
MACT, alleging that the deceased was fatally injured by a mini door 
auto (a goods carriage vehicle) on 31.10.2004 while she was 
standing at a location known as ‘Hardi Turning’.  The Insurance 
Company resisted the claim by contending that the driver did not 
possess a valid and effective licence to operate the vehicle. The 
Tribunal allowed the claim and directed the payment of Rs. 
1,83,000/- holding that the driver’s Light Motor Vehicle (LMV) 
licence was sufficient. This view was upheld by the High Court.  
94.1. Setting aside the above decisions favouring the claim, a two-
judge bench of this Court held that the holder of a LMV license 
must also obtain a separate endorsement for a transport vehicle. 
It noted that the definition of LMV under Section 2(21) of MV Act 
would bring within its umbrage a Transport Vehicle but a 
distinction exists between the two as per Section 3 which deals 
 
41 (2009) 11 SCC 356 

Page 96 of 126 
 
with the necessity of a driving license. It was thus noted in Para 
15 and 16 of the judgment: 
“15. Section 9 provides for “grant of driving licence”. 
Section 10 prescribes the form and contents of licences to 
drive which is to the following effect: 
“10. Form and contents of licences to drive.—(1) 
Every learner's licence and driving licence, except a 
driving licence issued under Section 18, shall be in 
such form and shall contain such information as 
may be prescribed by the Central Government. 
(2) A learner's licence or, as the case may be, driving 
licence shall also be expressed as entitling the 
holder to drive a motor vehicle of one or more of the 
following classes, namely: 
(a)-(c)*** 
(d) light motor vehicle; 
(e) transport vehicle; [ Substituted for clauses (e) to 
(h) by Act 54 of 1994, Section 8 (w.e.f. 14-11-1994).] 
(i) road roller; 
(j) motor vehicle of a specified description.” 
The distinction between a “light motor vehicle” and a 
“transport vehicle” is, therefore, evident. A transport vehicle 
may be a light motor vehicle but for the purpose of driving 
the same, a distinct licence is required to be obtained. 
16. The distinction between a “transport vehicle” and a 
“passenger vehicle” can also be noticed from Section 14 of 
the Act. Sub-section (2) of Section 14 provides for duration 
of a period of three years in case of an effective licence to 
drive a “transport vehicle” whereas in case of any other 
licence, it may remain effective for a period of 20 years.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 

Page 97 of 126 
 
94.2. Relying on the judgment in Prabhu Lal(supra) which 
distinguished Ashok Gangadhar Maratha(supra), the Court in 
Angad KoI held that a driver of the mini goods carriage auto 
holding a LMV license, need not have a license for a Transport 
Vehicle. The Court also referred to Annappa Irappa Nesaria(supra) 
to note that the amendment (applicable prospectively) specifically 
introduced the term ‘Transport Vehicle’ in Section 10.  Following 
this amendment, a specific endorsement for driving a Transport 
Vehicle would be necessary. It was also noted that since the license 
was granted for 20 years, a presumption arose that it was for a 
vehicle other than a transport vehicle. It was ultimately held that 
the driver did not have a valid driving license, for driving a ‘goods 
vehicle’ and breach of conditions of the insurance policy was found 
apparent on the face of record. However, exercising its power under 
Article 142, this Court directed the Insurance Company to deposit 
the compensation amount before the Tribunal with liberty to the 
claimants to withdraw the same providing the right of recovery to 
the Insurance Company to recover the deposited sum from the 
owner and the driver of the vehicle.  
94.3. Before this Court, the Counsel for the Insurance Companies 
placed reliance on the above decision in Angad Kol(supra) to argue 

Page 98 of 126 
 
that there is a clear distinction between ‘transport vehicle’ and 
‘light motor vehicle’. Let us examine if such argument deserves our 
endorsement. 
94.4. The decision in Angad Kol(supra) was rendered when Prabhu 
Lal(supra) and Annapa Irappa Nesaria(supra) held the field. 
However, as 
we have 
noticed earlier, 
Prabhu Lal(supra) 
conspicuously failed to notice the definition of LMV in Section 2(21) 
even though it considered the definition of Transport Vehicle. It 
also wrongly distinguished Ashok Gangadhar Maratha(supra), 
where the legal position was clearly stated as under:  
“10. The definition of “light motor vehicle” as given in clause 
(21) of Section 2 of the Act can apply only to a “light goods 
vehicle” or a “light transport vehicle”. A “light motor vehicle” 
otherwise has to be covered by the definition of “motor vehicle” 
or “vehicle” as given in clause (28) of Section 2 of the Act. A 
light motor vehicle cannot always mean a light goods carriage. 
Light motor vehicle can be a non-transport vehicle as well.” 
94.5. The Court in Angad Kol(supra) overlooked the crucial legal 
analysis in Para 9 and 10 and instead distinguished Ashok 
Gangadhar Maratha(supra) by relying on Para 11 where the 
Court only provided additional reasoning on the requirement of 
a ‘permit’. A ‘driving license’ is different from a ‘permit’. The 
conflation of the two terms led to the confusion. While a driving 

Page 99 of 126 
 
license relates to a driver’s qualification, a ‘permit’ relates to the 
vehicle’s operational classification.  
94.6. The Court in Angad Kol(supra) also relied on Annapa Irappa 
Nesaria(supra), which held that the introduction of Transport 
Vehicles post-amendment would imply that a specific endorsement 
would be needed for Transport Vehicles. At the cost of repetition, 
even otherwise, a comprehensive reading of the MV Act and Rules 
shows that the specific mention of the term Transport Vehicle in 
different places of the Act and Rules for the purpose of driving 
license would reasonably be applicable only for those Transport 
Vehicles, that fall above the weight limit prescribed in Section 2(21) 
for LMVs.  
95. In S. Iyyapan v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd42., the 2-judge 
bench relied on inter alia, Ashok Gangadhar Maratha(supra) and 
Annappa Irappa Nesaria(supra). The case stemmed from an 
accident involving a Mahindra Maxi Cab (a light motor vehicle) that 
led to the death of one person. The deceased's wife filed a claim 
before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal. The Tribunal awarded 
Rs. 2,42,000/- in compensation and held that a person holding a 
LMV License was entitled to drive a Mahindra Maxi Cab. The High 
 
42 (2013) 7 SCC 62 

Page 100 of 126 
 
Court, however reversed this decision noting that the vehicle was 
used as a taxi and hence it was a commercial vehicle. It held that 
a separate license is necessary for driving a commercial vehicle. 
The Supreme court however restored the decision of MACT stating 
that the driver with a LMV license was legally competent to drive 
the Max Cab, used as a taxi. The Court additionally considered 
Sections 146, 147, and 149 of the MV Act and noted that under 
certain circumstances, insurers could limit their liability, but they 
were still bound to pay compensation to third parties. The right of 
third parties to compensation was protected by law, and the 
insurer could later recover the amount from the insured if any 
policy violation occurred. The Supreme Court categorically held 
that since the driver had a valid LMV licence, and the Mahindra 
Maxi Cab was classified as an LMV, the insurance company was 
liable to pay the compensation. The following was the relevant 
discussion for what appears to be the correct conclusion in S 
Iyyappan(supra):-   
“18. In the instant case, admittedly the driver was holding 
a valid driving licence to drive light motor vehicle. There is 
no dispute that the motor vehicle in question, by which 
accident took place, was Mahindra Maxi Cab. Merely 
because the driver did not get any endorsement in the 
driving licence to drive Mahindra Maxi Cab, which is a light 
motor vehicle, the High Court has committed grave error 
of law in holding that the insurer is not liable to pay 
compensation because the driver was not holding the 

Page 101 of 126 
 
licence to drive the commercial vehicle. The impugned 
judgment [ Civil Misc. Appeal No. 1016 of 2002, order 
dated 31-10-2008 (Mad)] is, therefore, liable to be set 
aside.” 
96. Similarly, in Kulwant Singh v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd43,the 
question for consideration was whether the Insurance Company 
had recovery rights for breach of conditions of insurance policy 
when the driver possesses a valid driving licence for driving light 
vehicle but fails to obtain endorsement for driving goods vehicle? 
In that case, the L/Rs of the deceased had filed a claim before the 
MACT following a road accident death on 8.10.2005. The deceased 
was driving a tempo which was hit by a Tata-407 Tempo. The 
tribunal held that the claimants were entitled to compensation. 
The High Court, however, held that there was a breach of policy 
conditions and the insurance company was entitled to recover the 
compensation amount from the owner of the vehicle.  
96.1. The 2-judge bench of the Supreme Court opined that the 
issue stands covered by the judgment in S. Iyyapan(supra). It 
therefore held that the insurance company could not avoid 
liability merely because, the driver did not have an endorsmement 
to drive a commercial vehicle.  
 
43 (2015a) 2 SCC 186  

Page 102 of 126 
 
96.2 In view of the reasons assigned by us and as rightly noted in 
Mukund Dewangan(2017), the decisions in S. Iyyapan(supra) and 
Kulwant Singh(supra)  were decided correctly. However, as regards 
the reliance on Annappa Irappa Nesaria(supra), post-amendment 
in Section 10 also, the law continues to be the same for  vehicles 
falling within the LMV category.   
96.3. Therefore, the judgments where the Court has held that a 
separate endorsement for a ‘transport vehicle’ may not be 
necessary 
i.e. 
in 
Ashok 
Gangadhar 
Maratha(supra), 
Nagashetty(supra), S. Iyyapan(supra) and Kulwant Singh(supra) 
are found to align with our reasoning and interpretation and they 
are therefore upheld.   In consequence, the three judgments which 
concluded 
otherwise 
i.e. 
Prabhu 
Lal(supra), 
Roshanben 
Rahemansha Fakir(supra) and Angad Kol(supra) are overruled 
based on the reasoning provided by us in this judgment. The 
decision in Annappa Irappa Nesaria(supra) is partially overruled 
to the extent that the position even post-amendment would 
remain the same.  
VI. Is Mukund Dewangan(2017) per incuriam? 
97.  Shifting gears, we may recall that the decision in Mukund 
Dewangan(2017) was doubted for not noticing certain provisions 

Page 103 of 126 
 
of the MV Act and MV Rules. These include, inter alia, Section 4(1), 
7, 14, the second proviso to Section 15 and Section 180 and 181 
of the MV Act. It was therefore argued before this Court that the 
said decision is per incuriam. To begin with, it is useful to refer to 
some decisions that have expounded on the principle of per 
incuriam.  
98. The term per incuriam is a Latin term which means ‘by 
inadvertence’ or ‘lack of care’. English Courts have developed this 
principle in relaxation of the rule of stare decisis. In Halsbury's 
Laws of England44 , the concept of per incuriam was explained as 
under:  
“A decision is given per incuriam when the court has 
acted in ignorance of a previous decision of its own or of 
a court of coordinate jurisdiction which covered the case 
before it, in which case it must decide which case to 
follow45; or when it has acted in ignorance of a House of 
Lords decision, in which case it must follow that decision; 
or when the decision is given in ignorance of the terms of 
a statute or rule having statutory force 46 . A decision 
should not be treated as given per incuriam, however, 
simply because of a deficiency of parties47, or because the 
court had not the benefit of the best argument48, and, as 
a general rule, the only cases in which decisions should

be held to be given per incuriam are those given in 
ignorance of some inconsistent statute or binding 
authority49. Even if a decision of the Court of Appeal has 
misinterpreted a previous decision of the House of Lords, 
the Court of Appeal must follow its previous decision and 
leave the House of Lords to rectify the mistake.”  
 
  
 
                   [emphasis supplied] 
99. Lord Evershed in Morelle Ld. V Wakeling50 (for short “Morelle”) 
explained the concept as under: 
“As a general rule the only cases in which decisions should be 
held to have been given per incuriam are those of decisions 
given  in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent 
statutory provision or of some authority binding on the court 
concerned; so that in such cases some part of the decision or 
some step in the reasoning on which it is based is found, on 
that account, to be demonstrably wrong” 
  
  
 
 
            [emphasis supplied] 
100. A few months after the decision in Morelle(supra), the 
Constitution Bench of this Court in Bengal Immunity Co. 
Ltd. v. State of Bihar51 adopted the per incuriam principle. It held 
that while Article 141 states that the Supreme Court’s decisions 
are "binding on all courts within the territory of India," this does 
not extend to binding the Supreme Court itself, which remains free 
to reconsider its judgments in appropriate cases.

101. In Mamleshwar Prasad v. Kanhaiya Lal52 , reflecting on the 
principle of per incuriam, this Court speaking through Krishna Iyer 
J.  held thus:  
         “7. Certainty of the law, consistency of rulings and comity of 
courts — all flowering from the same principle — converge 
to the conclusion that a decision once rendered must later 
bind like cases. We do not intend to detract from the rule 
that, 
in 
exceptional 
instances, 
where 
by 
obvious 
inadvertence or oversight a judgment fails to notice a plain 
statutory provision or obligatory authority running counter 
to the reasoning and result reached, it may not have the 
sway of binding precedents. It should be a glaring case, 
an obtrusive omission. No such situation presents itself 
here and we do not embark on the principle of judgment 
per incuriam.”

102. In A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak53 , the Constitution Bench of 
this Court made the following observations:  
“42. It appears that when this Court gave the aforesaid 
directions on 16-2-1984, for the disposal of the case against 
the appellant by the High Court, the directions were given 
oblivious of the relevant provisions or law and the decision

.  
“Per incuriam” are those decisions given in ignorance or 
forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provision or of 
some authority binding on the court concerned, so that in such 
cases some part of the decision or some step in the reasoning 
on which it is based, is found, on that account to be 
demonstrably wrong. SeeMorelle Ltd. v. Wakeling [Morelle

that in view of the clear provisions of Section 7(2) of the 
Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 and Articles 14 and 21 
of the Constitution, these directions were legally wrong.” 
103. In MCD v Gurnam Kaur54, A 3-Judge bench of this Court held 
that:  
"11. ... A decision should be treated as given per incuriam 
when it is given in ignorance of the terms of a statute or of a 
rule having the force of a statute." 
104. 
In Punjab 
Land 
Development 
& 
Reclamation 
Corpn. 
Ltd. v. Labour Court55 , a five-judge bench of this Court said the 
following in the context of the principle of per incuriam for ignoring 
statutory provisions :-  
“43. As regards the judgments of the Supreme Court 
allegedly rendered in ignorance of a relevant constitutional 
provision or other statutory provisions on the subjects 
covered by them, it is true that the Supreme Court may not 
be said to “declare the law” on those subjects if the relevant 
provisions were not really present to its mind. But in this 
case Sections 25-G and 25-H were not directly attracted and

even if they could be said to have been attracted in laying 
down the major premise, they were to be interpreted 
consistently with the subject or context. The problem of 
judgment per incuriam when actually arises, should present 
no difficulty as this Court can lay down the law afresh, if two 
or more of its earlier judgments cannot stand together.” 
 
  
 
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
105. In N.Bhargavan Pillai v. State of Kerala56, a two-judge bench 
speaking through Arijit Pasayat J. noted that a judgment cannot 
be treated as a binding precedent, if it fails to notice a specific 
statutory bar:  
“14. Coming to the plea relating to benefits under the 
Probation Act, it is to be noted that Section 18 of the said Act 
clearly rules out application of the Probation Act to a case 
covered under Section 5(2) of the Act. Therefore, there is no 
substance in the accused-appellant's plea relating to grant 
of benefit under the Probation Act. The decision in Bore 
Gowda case [(2000) 10 SCC 260 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 1244] does 
not even indicate that Section 18 of the Probation Act was 
taken note of. In view of the specific statutory bar the view, 
if any, expressed without analysing the statutory provision 
cannot in our view be treated as a binding precedent and at 
the most is to be considered as having been rendered per 
incuriam. Looked at from any angle, the appeal is sans merit 
and deserves dismissal which we direct.” 
106. In State of M.P. v. Narmada Bachao Andolan57, this Court 
reiterated: 
"67. Thus, "per incuriam" are those decisions given in 
ignorance or forgetfulness of some statutory provision or 
authority binding on the W.P.(C)Nos.7785, 7851, court 
concerned, or a statement of law caused by inadvertence or

conclusion that has been arrived at without application of 
mind or proceeded without any reason so that in such a case 
some part of the decision or some step in the reasoning on 
which it is based, is found, on that account to be 
demonstrably wrong." 
107. Subsequently, in Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. v. Jindal Exports 
Ltd.58  this Court observed:  
“A prior decision of the Supreme Court on identical facts and 
law binds the Court on the same points of law in a later case. 
In exceptional instances, where by obvious inadvertence or 
oversight a judgment fails to notice a plain statutory 
provision or obligatory authority running counter to the 
reasoning and result reached, the principle of per incuriam 
may apply. Unless it is a glaring case of obtrusive 
omission, it is not desirable to depend on the principle of 
judgment ‘per incuriam’. It has to be shown that some part 
of the decision was based on a reasoning which was 
demonstrably wrong, for applying the principle of per 
incuriam.” 
 
  
 
 
[emphasis supplied] 
108. In State of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer 59 , the legal dilemma was 
noted as under:  
“10. … Easy course of saying that earlier decision was 
rendered per incuriam is not permissible and the matter will 
have to be resolved only in two ways — either to follow the 
earlier decision or refer the matter to a larger Bench to 
examine the issue, in case it is felt that earlier decision is not 
correct on merits.” 
 
 
58 (2001) 6 SCC 356 
59 (2003) 5 SCC 448 

Page 109 of 126 
 
109.  In Sundeep Kumar Bafna v. State of Maharashtra 60 , the 
Court expanded the definition of per incuriam in the Indian context 
and noted that:  
“A decision or judgment can also be per incuriam if it is not 
possible to reconcile its ratio with that of a previously 
pronounced judgment of a Co-equal or Larger Bench; or if 
the decision of a High Court is not in consonance with the 
views of this Court. It must immediately be clarified that the 
per incuriam rule is strictly and correctly applicable to the 
ratio decidendi and not to obiter dicta.” 
 
110.  In a recent decision in Shah Faesal v. Union of India61, a five 
judge bench of this Court reiterated that the principle of  per 
incuriam only applies on the ratio of the case. 
111.  After having examined the above decisions, when dealing 
with the ignorance of a statutory provision, we may bear in mind 
the following principles.  These may not however be exhaustive:  
(i) A decision is per incuriam only when the overlooked statutory 
provision or legal precedent is central to the legal issue in question 
and might have led to a different outcome if those overlooked 
provisions were considered. It must be an inconsistent provision 
and a glaring case of obtrusive omission.  
 
60 (2014) 16 SCC 623 
61 (2020) 4 SCC 1 

Page 110 of 126 
 
(ii) The doctrine of per incuriam applies strictly to the ratio 
decidendi and does not apply to obiter dicta. 
(iii)If a court doubts the correctness of a precedent, the appropriate 
step is to either follow the decision or refer it to a larger Bench for 
reconsideration.  
(iv)It has to be shown that some part of the decision was based 
on a reasoning which was demonstrably wrong, for applying 
the principle of per incuriam. In exceptional instances, where 
by obvious inadvertence or oversight, a judgment fails to notice 
a plain statutory provision or obligatory authority running 
counter to the reasoning and result reached, the principle of 
per incuriam may apply. 
112. Applying the above principles to the case at hand, let us now 
apply our mind to the reference made in the context of the decision 
in Mukund Dewangan(2017). The following questions were 
referred:  
         “1. What is the meaning to be given to the definition of “light 
motor vehicle” as defined in Section 2(21) of the MV Act? 
Whether transport vehicles are excluded from it? 
          2. Whether “transport vehicle” and “omnibus” the “gross 
vehicle weight” of either of which does not exceed 7500 kg 
would be a “light motor vehicle” and also motor car or 
tractor or a roadroller, “unladen weight” of which does not 
exceed 7500 kg and holder of a licence to drive the class of 
“light motor vehicle” as provided in Section 10(2)(d) would 

Page 111 of 126 
 
be competent to drive a transport vehicle or omnibus, the 
“gross vehicle weight” of which does not exceed 7500 kg or 
a motor car or tractor or roadroller, the “unladen weight” of 
which does not exceed 7500 kg? 
          3. What is the effect of the amendment made by virtue of 
Act 54 of 1994 w.e.f. 14-11-1994 while substituting clauses 
(e) to (h) of Section 10(2) which contained “medium goods 
vehicle”, “medium passenger motor vehicle”, “heavy goods 
vehicle” and “heavy passenger motor vehicle” by “transport 
vehicle”? Whether insertion of expression “transport 
vehicle” under Section 10(2)(e) is related to said substituted 
classes only or it also excluded transport vehicle of light 
motor vehicle class from the purview of Sections 10(2)(d) 
and 2(41) of the Act? 
          4. What is the effect of amendment of Form 4 as to the 
operation of the provisions contained in Section 10 as 
amended in the year 1994 and whether the procedure to 
obtain the driving licence for transport vehicle of the class 
of “light motor vehicle” has been changed?” 
 
113.   The judgment in Mukund Dewangan (2017),  shows that the 
3 Judge Bench considered Section 2(21), 2(47) read with Section 
10 of MV Act. The Court also examined the legislative intent behind 
the 1994 amendment to Section 10, noting that while the 
amendment introduced the term "transport vehicle" under Section 
10(2)(e), it did not amend the definition of LMVs under Section 
2(21). It was further observed that the newly inserted provision of 
Section 10(2)(e) would only subsume those classes of vehicles that 
were contained in Sections 10(2)(e) to 10(2)(h) of the un-amended 
Act i.e. medium goods vehicle, medium passenger vehicle, heavy 
goods vehicle and heavy passenger vehicle, and which now stand 

Page 112 of 126 
 
deleted by virtue of the amendment of 1994. Since no amendment 
was carried out in Section 10(2)(d) of the Act which contains the 
class for ‘Light Motor Vehicles’, the scope of Section10(2)(d) would 
remain intact as is contained in Section 2(21) of the Act, which is 
to say that LMV would include ‘Transport Vehicles’ in cases where 
the gross weight of such vehicle is less than 7500 Kgs. It further 
noted that the syllabus does not provide separate training for 
transport vehicles but includes them under the relevant vehicle 
class based on the vehicle’s weight. It considered Rule 75 which 
deals with ‘State Register of motor vehicles’ as provided in Form 
41. Form 41 categorizes vehicles on the basis of, inter alia, gross 
vehicle weight, unladen weight etc. Likewise, the Court observed 
that Section 41, pertaining to registration, mandates the inclusion 
of relevant information as specified in Form 20, which outlines 
details such as the class of vehicle, gross vehicle weight, and 
unladen weight, among other factors.  
114. The court analysed those key provisions of the Act and Rules 
and reached a conclusion which is aligned with the discussion and 
opinion in this judgment. It rightly concluded as under: 
“(i) ‘Light motor vehicle’ as defined in section 2(21) of the Act 
would include a transport vehicle as per the weight 
prescribed 
in section 
2(21) read 
with section 
2(15) and 2(48). Such transport vehicles are not excluded 

Page 113 of 126 
 
from the definition of the light motor vehicle by virtue of 
Amendment Act No.54/1994. 
(ii) A transport vehicle and omnibus, the gross vehicle weight 
of either of which does not exceed 7500 kg. would be a light 
motor vehicle and also motor car or tractor or a road roller, 
‘unladen weight’ of which does not exceed 7500 kg. and 
holder of a driving licence to drive class of “light motor 
vehicle” as provided in section 10(2)(d) is competent to drive 
a transport vehicle or omnibus, the gross vehicle weight of 
which does not exceed 7500 kg. or a motor car or tractor or 
road-roller, the “unladen weight” of which does not exceed 
7500 kg. That is to say, no separate endorsement on the 
licence is required to drive a transport vehicle of light motor 
vehicle class as enumerated above. A licence issued 
under section 
10(2)(d) continues 
to 
be 
valid 
after 
Amendment Act 54/1994 and 28.3.2001 in the form. 
(iii) The effect of the amendment made by virtue of Act 
No.54/1994 w.e.f. 14.11.1994 while substituting clauses (e) 
to (h) of section 10(2) which contained “medium goods 
vehicle” in section 10(2)(e), medium passenger motor vehicle 
in section 
10(2)(f), 
heavy 
goods 
vehicle 
in section 
10(2)(g) and “heavy passenger motor vehicle” in section 
10(2)(h) with expression ‘transport vehicle’ as substituted 
in section 10(2)(e) related only to the aforesaid substituted 
classes only. It does not exclude transport vehicle, from the 
purview of section 10(2)(d) and section 2(41) of the Act i.e. 
light motor vehicle. 
(iv) The effect of amendment of Form 4 by insertion of 
“transport vehicle” is related only to the categories which 
were substituted in the year 1994 and the procedure to 
obtain driving licence for transport vehicle of class of “light 
motor vehicle” continues to be the same as it was and has 
not been changed and there is no requirement to obtain 
separate endorsement to drive transport vehicle, and if a 
driver is holding licence to drive light motor vehicle, he can 
drive transport 
vehicle of such class 
without any 
endorsement to that effect.” 
 
115.  It is true that Mukund Dewangan (2017) did not analyse the 
provisions that distinguish transport and non-transport vehicles, 
as noted in the reference orders. The statutory scheme of MV is 

Page 114 of 126 
 
more nuanced than the simple weight-based distinction made in 
the said judgment. Moreover, the Court failed to notice Section 
31(2) and 31(3) which specify ‘Transport’ and ‘Non-Transport’ 
vehicles. However, the judgment gave due consideration to the 
important statutory provisions. We have carefully looked at the 
relevant and the wide ranging provisions in our analysis in this 
decision. A harmonious interpretation, as we have explained 
earlier, would lead us to the same conclusion but fortified with 
some additional reasoning based on the consideration of all the 
relevant provisions.   The overlooked provisions would not, in our 
considered 
opinion, 
alter 
the 
eventual 
pronouncement.  
Importantly, we do not notice any glaring error or omission that 
would alter the outcome of the case. Therefore, the ratio in Mukund 
Dewangan (2017) should not be disturbed by applying the 
principles of per incuriam. 
F. IMPACT ON ROAD SAFETY  
116.  The counsel for the insurance Companies raised concerns 
regarding road safety, arguing that if the present law in Mukund 
Dewangan(2017) is not interfered with, unfit drivers will start 
plying Transport Vehicles putting at risk the lives of thousands of 
people. One of the supporting Intervenors placed  reliance on Para 

Page 115 of 126 
 
57 of the decision of this Court in Savelife Foundation v. Union of 
India 62  where this Court while exercising its public interest 
litigation jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution of India 
held that the Right to life under Article 21 also includes the right 
to safety of persons travelling on the road. Per contra, in the 
intervention application filed on behalf of auto drivers, it was 
argued that the members of the Applicant Intervenor have been 
permitted to operate taxis and motorcabs while holding an LMV 
licence for the past almost 6 years. Reconsideration of the same is 
not merely an issue of insurance coverage, rather it directly 
pertains to the livelihood of those operating transport vehicles of 
the LMV class, thereby giving rise to a fair consideration of their 
rights under Article 19(1)(g). It was submitted that if this Court 
upsets Mukund Dewangan(2017), which it should not, a transition 
period of 12-24 months be provided. 
117.  The above submissions will now require our consideration. 
It is true that in its PIL jurisdiction, this Court has passed orders 
in a myriad of cases including elevating the right of road safety to 
a fundamental right. It has also taken over policy areas 63  by 
 
62 (2016) 7 SCC 194 
63 See Ashok H Desai and S Muralidhar, ‘Public Interest Litigation: Potential 
and Problems’ in B.N Kirpal and others (eds), Supreme but not Infallible – 

Page 116 of 126 
 
appointing Commissioners to gather facts or to take expert advice 
in the form of reports. However, this Court should be conscious 
that this is neither a Public Interest Litigation jurisdiction nor is 
the Court testing the constitutional validity of any of the 
provisions. Moreover, no empirical data has been produced before 
us to show that road accidents in India have increased as a direct 
result of drivers with LMV license, plying a transport vehicle of 
LMV class of vehicles whose gross weight is within 7500 Kg.  Road 
safety is indeed an important objective of the MV Act but our 
reasoning must not be founded on unverified assumptions without 
any empirical data. The dangers of reasoning without empirical 
data 64  and beyond the statutory scheme of the Act must be 
avoided.  While we are mindful of issues of road safety, the task of 
crafting policy lies within the domain of the legislature. As a 
constitutional court, it is not our role to dictate policy decisions or 
rewrite laws.  We must be mindful of the institutional limitation to 
address such concerns. 
118. The complexities surrounding the question of whether the 
Court should examine not only the existing laws and definitions, 
 
Essays in Honour of the Supreme Court of India (Oxford University Press 
2000) 
 
64 Anuj Bhuwania, ‘Courting the People— Public Interest Litigation in Post-
Emergency India’ (Cambridge University Press 2017).

but also the broader underlying issues of policy have been vividly 
captured 
in 
the 
following 
words 
from 
Salmond 
on 
Jurisprudence65: 
         “Rules, which are originally designed to fit social needs, 
develop into concepts, which then proceed to take on a life of 
their own to the detriment of legal development. The 
resulting "jurisprudence of concepts" produces a slot-
machine approach to law whereby new points posing 
questions of social policy are decided, not by reference to the 
underlying social situation, but by reference to the meaning 
and definition of the legal concepts involved. This formalistic 
a priori approach confines the law in a strait-jacket instead 
of permitting it to expand to meet the new needs and 
requirements of changing society. ……In such cases Courts 
should examine not only the existing laws and legal 
concepts, but also the broader underlying issues of policy. In 
fact presently, judges are seen to be paying increasing 
attention to the possible effects of their decision one way or 
the other…… Such an approach is to be welcomed, but it 
also warrants two comments. First, judicial inquiry into the 
general effects of a proposed decision tends itself to be of a 
fairly speculative nature. Secondly, Too much regard for 
policy and too little for legal consistency may result in a 
confusing and illogical complex of contrary decisions; and 
while it is true that ‘the life of the law has not been logic, it has 
been experience’ and that we should not wish it otherwise, 
nevertheless we should remember that ‘no system of law can 
be workable if it has not got logic at the root of it”

Maxwell 1966)

119. What follows from the above is that wherever possible, the 
Court must attempt to be consistent in its approach. The principle 
of stare decisis, which mandates that courts adhere to established 
precedents, plays a crucial role in maintaining legal stability and 
predictability. The finding in Mukund Dewangan(2017)  need not 
be disturbed owing to speculative concerns of road safety that 
intersect with broader policy issues.  
120. We may recall that during the course of the present 
proceeding, the Central Government was arrayed and the learned 
Attorney General was requested to obtain instructions on whether 
the legislative wing would wish to examine and undertake an 
appropriate amendment on the legal question of whether a person 
holding 
a driving license for 
a 
light 
motor 
vehicle 
is 
entitled to legally drive a ‘transport vehicle’ of a specified weight.  
An order to this effect was passed in light of the possible social 
impact of the reference, particularly on road safety and the 
livelihood issue. Pursuant to this, the learned Attorney General 
submitted a note, inter alia, suggesting multiple amendments 
including a further classification of LMVs into LMV Class 1 and 
LMV Class 2, each with different weight thresholds. 

Page 119 of 126 
 
121.  Had the Parliament acted sooner to amend the MV Act and 
clearly differentiated between classes, categories and types, much 
of the uncertainty surrounding driving licenses could have been 
addressed, reducing the need for frequent litigation and an unclear 
legal terrain. The confusion and inconsistency in judicial decisions 
continued to persist for 25 years starting from the 1999 decision 
in Ashok Gangadhar Maratha(supra). 
122.  Road safety is a serious public health issue globally. It is 
crucial to mention that in India, over 1.7 lakh persons66 were killed 
in road accidents in 2023. The causes of such accidents are 
diverse, and assumptions that they stem from drivers operating 
light transport vehicles with an LMV license are unsubstantiated. 
Factors67 contributing to road accidents include careless driving, 
speeding, poor road design, and failure to adhere to traffic laws. 
Other significant contributors are mobile phone usage, fatigue, 
and non-compliance with seat belt or helmet regulations. 
123. Driving a motor vehicle is a complex task requiring both 
practical skills and theoretical knowledge. Safe driving involves not

only technical vehicle control68 but also proficiency in various road 
conditions, including managing speed 69 , turns, and spatial 
awareness relative to other vehicles. Additionally, handling road 
gradients demands skill, particularly with brakes
70  and 
maneuvering. Effective driving requires awareness of road signs, 
adherence to traffic rules71 , and a focus on the road free from 
distractions. The core skills expected of all drivers apply 
universally, regardless of whether the vehicle falls into transport 
or non-transport categories.  
124. At this juncture, it is also essential to note the scheme72 
devised in accordance with Section 75 of MV Act whereby the pre-
requisites in the form of ‘General Conditions’ to be maintained by 
the ‘holder of license’ ensure safety and compliance. Certain 
guidelines73 have also been enacted in so far as aggregators are 
concerned whereby chapters outlining ‘Conditions for grant of 
licence for Aggregator’, ‘Compliance with regard to Drivers’, 
‘Compliance with regard to Vehicles’ as also ‘Compliances to

ensure safety’ further address the speculative concerns raised on 
behalf of the counsel for insurance companies. 
G. CONCLUSION 
125.  The licensing regime under the MV Act and the MV Rules, 
when read as a whole, does not provide for a separate endorsement 
for operating a ‘Transport Vehicle’, if a driver already holds a LMV 
license. We must however clarify that the exceptions carved out by 
the legislature for special vehicles like e-carts and e-rickshaws74, 
or vehicles carrying hazardous goods75, will remain unaffected by 
the decision of this Court.   
126.  As discussed earlier in this judgment, the definition of LMV 
under Section 2(21) of the MV Act explicitly provides what a 
‘Transport Vehicle’ ‘means’.  This Court must ensure that neither 
provision i.e. the definition under Section 2(21) or the second part 
of Section 3(1) which concerns the necessity for a driving license 
for a ‘Transport Vehicle’ is reduced to a dead letter of law. 
Therefore, the emphasis on ‘Transport Vehicle’  in the licensing 
scheme has to be understood only in the context of the ‘medium’ 
 
74 See Rule 8A of MV Rules,’Minimum training required for driving E-
rickshaw or E-cart’ 
75 See Rule 9 of MV Rules, ’Educational Qualification for drivers of goods 
carriages carrying dangerous or hazardous goods’ 

Page 122 of 126 
 
and ‘heavy’ vehicles. This harmonious reading also aligns with the 
objective of the 1994 amendment in Section 10(2) to simplify the 
licensing procedure76.  
127.  The above interpretation also does not defeat the broader 
twin objectives of the MV Act i.e. road safety and ensuring timely 
compensation and relief for victims of road accidents. The aspect 
of road safety is earlier discussed at length. An authoritative 
pronouncement by this Court would prevent insurance companies 
from taking a technical plea to defeat a legitimate claim for 
compensation involving an insured vehicle weighing below 7,500 
kgs driven by a person holding a driving license of a ‘Light Motor 
Vehicle’ class. 
128.  In an era where autonomous or driver-less vehicles are no 
longer tales of science fiction and app-based passenger platforms 
are a modern reality, the licensing regime cannot remain static. 
The amendments that have been carried out by the Indian 
legislature may not have dealt with all possible concerns. As we 
were informed by the Learned Attorney General that a legislative 
exercise is underway, we hope that a comprehensive amendment

goods 
vehicle[(10(2)(e)], 
medium 
passenger 
vehicle[10(2)(f)],heavy goods vehicle[10(2)(g)] and heavy passenger vehicle 
[10(2)(h)] were deleted and a new class ‘Transport Vehicle’ was introduced in 
Section 10(2)(e). 

Page 123 of 126 
 
to address the statutory lacunae will be made with necessary 
corrective measures.  
129.  Just to flag one concern, the legislature through the 1994 
amendment in Section 10(2)(e) in order to introduce ‘transport 
vehicle’ as a separate class could not have intended to merge light 
motor vehicle (which continued as a distinct class) along with 
medium, and heavy vehicles into a single class. Else, it would give 
rise to a situation in which Sri (our hypothetical character), 
wanting to participate in the cycling sport, is put through the 
rigorous training relevant only for a multisport like Triathlon, 
which requires a much higher degree of endurance and 
athleticism. The effort therefore should be to ensure that the 
statute remains practical and workable.    
130.   Now harking back to the primary issue and noticing that 
the core driving skills (as enunciated in the earlier paragraphs), 
expected to be mastered by all drivers are universal – regardless of 
whether the vehicle falls into “Transport” or “Non-Transport” 
category, it is the considered opinion of this Court that if the gross 
vehicle weight is within 7,500 kg - the quintessential common 
man’s driver Sri, with LMV license, can also drive a “Transport 
Vehicle”.  We are able to reach such a conclusion as none of the 

Page 124 of 126 
 
parties in this case has produced any empirical data to 
demonstrate that the LMV driving licence holder, driving a 
‘Transport Vehicle’, is a significant cause for road accidents in 
India.   The additional eligibility criteria as specified in MV Act and 
MV Rules as discussed in this judgment will apply only to such 
vehicle (‘medium goods vehicle’, ‘medium passenger vehicle’, 
‘heavy goods vehicle’ and ‘heavy passenger vehicle’), whose gross 
weight exceeds 7,500 Kg.  Our present interpretation on how the 
licensing regime is to operate for drivers under the statutory 
scheme is unlikely to compromise the road safety concerns.  This 
will also effectively address the livelihood issues for drivers 
operating Transport Vehicles (who clock maximum hours behind 
the wheels), in legally operating “Transport vehicles” (below 7,500 
Kg), with their LMV driving license.  Perforce Sri must drive 
responsibly and should have no occasion to be called either a 
maniac or an idiot (as mentioned in the first paragraph), while he 
is behind the wheels. Such harmonious interpretation will 
substantially address the vexed question of law before this Court. 
131. Our conclusions following the above discussion are as 
under:-  
(I) A driver holding a license for Light Motor Vehicle (LMV) 
class, under Section 10(2)(d) for vehicles with a gross 

Page 125 of 126 
 
vehicle weight under 7,500 kg, is permitted to operate a 
‘Transport 
Vehicle’ 
without 
needing 
additional 
authorization under Section 10(2)(e) of the MV Act 
specifically for the ‘Transport Vehicle’ class. For 
licensing purposes, LMVs and Transport Vehicles are 
not entirely separate classes. An overlap exists between 
the two. The special eligibility requirements will 
however continue to apply for, inter alia, e-carts, e-
rickshaws, and vehicles carrying hazardous goods.  
 
(II)  The second part of Section 3(1), which emphasizes the 
necessity of a specific requirement to drive a ‘Transport 
Vehicle,’ does not supersede the definition of LMV 
provided in Section 2(21) of the MV Act.  
 
(III) The additional eligibility criteria specified in the MV 
Act and MV Rules generally for driving ‘transport 
vehicles’ would apply only to those intending to operate 
vehicles with gross vehicle weight exceeding 7,500 kg 
i.e. ‘medium goods vehicle’, ‘medium passenger vehicle’, 
‘heavy goods vehicle’ and ‘heavy passenger vehicle’.  
 
(IV) The decision in Mukund Dewangan (2017) is upheld 
but for reasons as explained by us in this judgment. In 
the absence of any obtrusive omission, the decision is 
not per incuriam, even if certain provisions of the MV Act 
and MV Rules were not considered in the said judgment.
