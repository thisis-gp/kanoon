1. 
The premises in question were in the possession of 
three tenants. However, for the present, we are 
concerned 
with 
only 
two 
tenants, 
namely 
Vijaykumar Vishwanath Dhawale and Vinod 
Dodhu Chaudhary. As the third tenant had not 

SLP(Crl.) No. 14585 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 3 of 10 
 
filed any complaint and only the above two named 
complainants have filed the complaint, that is why 
the third tenant is not a party to the proceedings.  
 
2. 
The premises in dispute were owned by one Rajeev 
Ramrao Chavan. He sold the property to five 
persons, namely Sanjay Nathmal Jain, Sunil 
Mishrilal Jain, Manoj Mishrilal Jain, Ghanshyam 
Bansilal Agrawal and Prasannachand Sobhagmal 
Parakh, 
vide 
registered 
sale 
deed 
dated 
27.10.2021. 
Unfortunately, 
Rajeev 
Ramrao 
Chavan, the vendor of the sale deed dated 
27.10.2021, died allegedly having committed 
suicide on 08.03.2022 and having left behind a 
suicide note, naming the tenants as abettors. On 
the strength of the same, a complaint was made to 
the local police. However, an accidental death was 
registered, but no FIR1 was registered under 
Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code, 18602.  
 
3. 
Soon thereafter, i.e., on 09.03.2022, the tenants 
were called to the concerned Police Station. They

SLP(Crl.) No. 14585 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 4 of 10 
 
were held for about 24 hours, and in the meantime, 
the premises in question were demolished by the 
brother of the deceased-vendor, his widow, and 
with the support of the local police. At the Police 
Station, the tenants were also forced to sign some 
documents, apparently giving their consent of 
vacating the premises voluntarily. 
 
4. 
The two tenants, Vijaykumar Vishwanath Dhawale 
and Vinod Dodhu Chaudhary lodged complaint 
initially with the Police Station, but as the same 
was not acknowledged, they moved an application 
before the concerned Magistrate under Section 
156(3) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 19733. In the 
complaint made by the two tenants, 13 accused 
were named, namely Dr. Sanjeev Ramrao Chavan 
i.e. brother of the deceased, Smita Rajeev Chavan 
i.e. widow of the deceased, the five purchasers 
mentioned above under the sale deed dated 
27.10.2021, and six police personnel namely, 
Shatrughna Atmaram Patil, Jaipal Manikrao Hire, 
Milind Ashok Bhamare, Suryakant Raghunath 
 
3 In short, “Cr.P.C.”

Salunkhe, Nilesh Subhash More and Sunil Kautik 
Hatkar. 
 
5. 
The learned Magistrate, dealing with the Section 
156(3) Cr.P.C. application, instead of directing the 
police to register the FIR and investigate, passed an 
order on 20.12.2022 for an inquiry under Section 
202 Cr.P.C., confining it to the involvement of the 
brother of the deceased, widow of the deceased, 
and the five purchasers. This order of the 
Magistrate 
was 
challenged 
by 
the 
tenants/complainants before the Sessions Judge. 
The Sessions Judge vide order dated 23.03.2023, 
allowed the revision and directed that the 
complaint filed before the Magistrate under Section 
156(3) Cr.P.C. be forwarded to the concerned Police 
Station for registration and investigation. 
 
6. 
The order of the Revisional Court dated 23.03.2023 
was challenged before the High Court by all the 13 
accused through separate petitions titled under 
Section 482 Cr.P.C. and Article 227 of the 
Constitution of India. The High Court, while 
deciding these petitions, not only approved the 

SLP(Crl.) No. 14585 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 6 of 10 
 
order of the Sessions Judge but also issued further 
directions 
regarding 
investigation, 
by 
the 
impugned order dated 23.10.2023. It is this order 
which is under challenge before us by way of these 
six petitions. Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 15433 
of 2023 and Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 15294 
of 2023 have been filed by the brother of the 
deceased with respect to the two complaints made 
by the two tenants. Special Leave Petition (Crl.) 
Nos. 14734-14735 of 2023 have been filed by the 
five purchasers under the sale deed dated 
27.10.2021 again with respect to the two 
complaints filed by the two tenants. Special Leave 
Petition (Crl.) No. 14585 of 2023 and Special Leave 
Petition (Crl.) No. 14572 of 2023 have been filed by 
the six police personnel again arising out of the two 
complaints filed by the two tenants.  
 
7. 
During the pendency of the petitions, it appears 
that some settlement has been arrived at between 
the complainants and the 13 accused. The 
subsequent purchasers have paid an amount of Rs. 
10 lacs to each of the tenants, and in lieu thereof, 
the tenants have filed their affidavits stating that 

SLP(Crl.) No. 14585 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 7 of 10 
 
they do not wish to further prosecute their 
complaint. The details of the bank drafts have also 
been mentioned in the affidavits filed by the 
tenants along with Criminal Miscellaneous Petition 
No. 8150 of 2024 in Special Leave Petition (Crl.) 
Nos. 14734-14735 of 2023. Based on this 
settlement, it is prayed that these petitions may be 
allowed, and the proceedings arising out of the two 
criminal complaints under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. 
be quashed.  
 
8. 
From the factual matrix as recorded above, we find 
that the continuance of these two criminal 
proceedings would not be of any avail once the 
complainant has himself stated to withdraw the 
complaint. Their losses having been compensated, 
any further investigation or trial would be an 
exercise in futility. 
 
9. 
The compensation for the tenants has been given 
by the subsequent purchasers, as stated in the 
affidavits, apparently for the reason that they are 
now the owners of the property and they have been 
instrumental in carrying out the demolition 

SLP(Crl.) No. 14585 of 2023 & Ors.

illegally. The widow of the deceased (although not a 
party before us) and the brother may not be having 
any further interest inasmuch as the property had 
already been sold by the deceased four and half 
months prior to his death. However, what we are 
not satisfied with is why the police personnel have 
been allowed to go scot-free in a case where they 
had an apparent roll in conspiring and in abetting 
the crime of the illegal detention of the tenants, 
coercing them to sign the document against their 
will, and getting the premises in question 
demolished without any order from a competent 
Court.  
 
10. We, accordingly, direct that the six police personnel 
will suffer a cost of Rs. 6.0 lacs for each of the two 
complainants. Out of the six police personnel, three 
are constables, one is a Head Constable, one is a 
Sub-Inspector, and one is an Inspector. They shall 
suffer a cost of Rs. 50,000/- per Constable, 
Rs.1,00,000/- by the Head Constable, Rs. 1.50 lacs 
by the Sub-Inspector, and Rs. 2.0 lacs by the 
Inspector, totalling Rs. 6.0 lacs for each case with 
the above distribution. This amount shall be 

SLP(Crl.) No. 14585 of 2023 & Ors. 
 
Page 9 of 10 
 
deposited in Account No. 90552010165915 of the 
Armed Forces Battle Casualties Welfare Fund, 
Canara Bank, Branch South Block, Defence 
Headquarters, within four weeks from today. After 
depositing the said amount in the aforesaid fund, 
they shall file proof of deposit with the Registry of 
this Court within six weeks and also before the 
Magistrate and the High Court. Upon deposit of the 
said amount, the proceedings of the two complaint 
cases shall stand quashed and closed. 
 
11. We, however, make it clear that any observations 
made and also the direction to suffer compensation 
to the tenants by the six police personnel will not 
be treated as adverse to their interest in 
consideration of their promotions etc. that is to say 
that this order may not be kept in their service 
records. 
 
12. It is further made clear that if the proof of deposit 
is not filed within the stipulated time, these 
petitions filed by the police personnel would stand 
dismissed.

13. In light of the above, Special Leave Petition (Crl.) 
No. 15433 of 2023, Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 
15294 of 2023 and Special Leave Petition (Crl.) Nos. 
14734-14735 of 2023 are allowed. Special Leave 
Petition (Crl.) No. 14572 of 2023 and Special Leave 
Petition (Crl.) No. 14585 of 2023 are also allowed, 
subject to fulfilment of the aforesaid condition.
