FACTUAL MATRIX  
 
1. 
The Olympic Riding and Equestrian Academy, Eastern Jaunapur, 
New Delhi (for short, “OREA”), is a training facility for enthusiastic 
equestrian athletes. Mr. Kapil Nath Modi administers and runs the said 
training facility. Appellant Nos. 2, 3, 6 and Respondent No. 2 were the 
trainee athletes in OREA. Appellant No. 1 is the mother of Appellant No. 
2. Appellant Nos. 4 and 5 are the parents of Appellant No. 6.  
2. 
Appellant No. 2 was admitted for equestrian training into the 
Academy in June 2010. Appellant No. 3 was accepted into OREA in the

year 2009. Appellant No. 6 has also been receiving training in the 
Academy for a little over two years. Respondent No. 2, a passionate 
athlete who dreamt of being the first Olympic champion of dressage, 
claims to have been receiving training in equestrian sport in OREA since 
2015.  
2.1 
The equestrian sport dates back to the ancient Greek era and has 
been an Olympic sport from 1900 onwards. The dressage sport is 
popularly known as horse ballet. The riders and their horses are judged 
based on their movement, calmness, suppleness and flexibility. One 
judges the horse’s enthusiasm to perform each element with minimum 
encouragement from the rider. For strangers to the sport, including non-
equestrian athletes, this sport displays the perfect sync between the horse 
and the rider.  
3. 
The controversy considered in the present appeal reflects whether 
the athletes under training at OREA, who wanted to control the mind and 
body of a horse, have lost the calmness, suppleness and flexibility while 
being trained at OREA. The Criminal Appeal concerns the complaint filed 
by Respondent No. 2 on 29.04.2018 before SHO P.S. Fatehpur Beri, 
South Delhi under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention 
of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (for short, “the Act of 1989”) against the Appellants 
herein and the application dated 09.05.2018 filed under section 156(3) of 

3 
 
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, “the CrPC”) before the 
Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate, South Saket Court, Delhi.   
3.1 
A few dates and events between the contesting parties from 
03.04.2018 to 09.05.2018 are prefaced to the narrative. On 03.04.2018, 
Appellant No. 4 filed a complaint before SHO, P.S. Fatehpur Beri, against 
the administrator of OREA. The said complaint is not made under any 
specific section of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The administrator, 
however, considering the nature of the allegations in the FIR lodged 
against him before SHO, P.S. Fatehpur Beri, on 06.04.2018, moved an 
application for anticipatory bail before the Saket District Court, Delhi. On 
11.04.2018, the anticipatory bail application of the administrator stood 
dismissed. On 12.04.2018, Appellant No. 1 and her husband filed yet 
another complaint against the administrator of OREA, on the alleged ill-
treatment meted out to their son/Appellant No. 2 by the administrator. On 
14.04.2018 and 15.04.2018, as the calmness of all the persons concerned 
is noticeably lost, in quick succession, admittedly, yet another complaint 
alleging sexual harassment, cheating and cruelty towards animals was 
filed against the administrator by Appellant Nos. 3, 4 and 6. A WhatsApp 
group “Alliance” was created by Appellant No. 6, which included Appellant 
Nos. 2 and 3 and one Daksh Mittal, another trainee athlete at OREA. 
Daksh Mittal wrote a letter dated 21.04.2018 to the administrator, 
informing the conspiracy being hatched by the members of the “Alliance” 

4 
 
WhatsApp group to kill the administrator and attack Respondent No. 2 by 
pouring acid on Respondent No. 2. The administrator, on 22.04.2018, by 
referring to the letter dated 21.04.2018, filed a complaint before SHO P.S. 
Fatehpur Beri for protection and also to prevent any plan being executed 
either on the administrator or Respondent No. 2 by a few members of the 
WhatsApp group, “Alliance”. It is not preposterous to advert at this stage 
of the narrative that the complaint dated 22.04.2018 dealt with what is 
informed through a letter dated 21.04.2018 by Daksh Mittal/trainee athlete 
at OREA and nothing else.  
3.2 
On 28.04.2018, Appellant Nos. 3, 5 and 6, along with the police and 
officers of the Animal Husbandry Department, visited the training facility 
of OREA at Eastern Jaunapur, New Delhi. On 29.04.2018, Respondent 
No. 2 filed a complaint before SHO P.S. Fatehpur Beri against the 
Appellants herein under the Act of 1989, which is the genesis for the 
present Criminal Appeal.

The grievance of Respondent No. 2 is that the information lodged 
on 29.04.2018 was not taken up, inquired, or investigated by the SHO of 
P.S. Fatehpur Beri. Respondent No. 2, alleges to have sent 
complaints/grievance petitions complaining inaction on the Complaint 
dated 29.04.2018, between 29.04.2018 and 08.05.2018, to all the 
authorities who matter in giving apt and appropriate directions to the SHO 
of P.S. Fatehpur Beri for timely investigation of the information lodged on 
29.04.2018. 
Respondent 
No. 
2 
has 
a 
grievance 
that 
the 
inquiry/investigation, on the complaint dated 29.04.2018, did not happen 
as mandated by the Act of 1989. Hence, on 09.05.2018, Respondent No. 
2 filed an application under section 156(3), read with section 200 of the 
CrPC before the Ld. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, South Saket Court for 
the following prayers:   
“It is therefore most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may 
kindly be pleased:  
a) To order registration of FIR under appropriate provisions of 
law and order fullfledged investigation, as may be mandatory and 
necessary in accordance of law.  
b) Pass such further order, as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit, 
just and proper in the interest of justice.”  
 
4. 
The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate referred the complaint dated 
09.05.2018 to the SHO, P.S. Fatehpur Beri. Our attention has been drawn 
by the respective Counsel appearing for the parties to the complaint dated 
29.04.2018 and the application dated 09.05.2018 filed before the 
Metropolitan Magistrate in detail in support of their respective arguments. 

8 
 
The application dated 09.05.2018 under section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C 
seeks to set in motion the jurisdiction of the competent criminal court on 
the complaint presented on 29.04.2018 by Respondent No. 2. Having in 
perspective the rival contentions canvassed by the parties, we deem it 
appropriate to excerpt the complaint dated 29.04.2018 filed before the 
SHO, P.S. Fatehpur Beri and also the application dated 09.05.2018 filed 
before the Magistrate for complete depiction of the alleged commissions 
or omissions under the Act of 1989. We indicate the change or 
improvement in the text of the complaint of Respondent No. 2 against the 
Appellants within the flower brackets of the application dated 09.05.2018. 
In a controversy as the one now examined by this Court; the narrative 
must be a mirror reflection of the case stated by Respondent No. 2. The 
excerpts would do the requirement and the complaint dated 29.04.2018 
reads thus:

“I am Praveen Kumar (Prashant) S/OLate Shri Sitam Singh, age 
23 Years, I am a boy from the Chamar caste. And I am a 
international horse riding champion and compete in Dressage 
(This is a Olympic event of horse riding). I have won over 30 
International and national medals in International Dressage 
Development league competitions.  
From July 205, I have been training under Mr. Kapil Modi who is 
a  and International dressage champions. 
From last two years, I have been intentionally abused and 
humiliated and my self respect was shattered. These dirty and 
dangerous actions against me were done by 3 students and their 
parents. These persons belong to very rich families. Their names 
are: Anush Agarwalla, Priti Agarwalla (mother ofAnush), Ameera 
Pasrich, her mother and father: Amir, Shivani Pasrich and Shikha 
Mundkur.  
International insult and Humiliation by, Anush Agarwalla on many 
occasions has publicly abused me by calling me "chuda, 
Chamar, chakka and faggot " 
International insult Humiliation by Priti Agarwalla (mother of 
Anush Agarwalla): whenever Priti visited Delhi to watch Anush 
Agarwalla during IDDL competitions she would tell me "Prashant 
you are a chamar and we rich Marwari’s don't like the fact that 
untouchables like you come close to us, you are unfit to even act 

11 
 
as a sweeper in our house. Whenever my son asks you for 
water/food you must wear plastic gloves and serve him"  
International insult and Humiliation by Amir Pasrich: on 17 
December when Amir came to the farm house he told me 
"Prashant sport of Dressage is not meant for chura and chamars 
like you, this sport is only meant for rich peopie like us. Tum apni 
aukat mai raha karo and when my daughter comes to ride don't 
come in front of her"  
International insult and humiliation by Shikha Mundkur and 
Ameera Pasrich: On 28 January 2018, I was riding a horse called 
“xanthos”. When Shikha and Ammera saw me riding the horse, 
both ran towards me hurling abuses at me and pushed me off the 
horse, they spat on me and said "you bloody mother fucking 
faggot if you ever dare to ride a horse again then it will have very 
bad consequences"  
All these people are jealous of me because I have become a 
champion rider via the IDDL and they hate me because I get 
trained for free. And these people have to pay fees and I have 
got all the Olympic horses from Kapil sir for competition purposes 
for free.   
When I got the print out of the detailed chat record of a whatsapp 
group called Alliance which was created by Shikha, Ameera, 
Anush with full support of their parents. In this group all these 
persons had planned to acid attack or torture me. on 22 April 
2018 DD No. 28B, 3:55pm Kapil Sir had registered a complaint 
in which he wrote that my life is under threat from these people. 
Till today police has not taken any action on this copy of the 
complaint is attached.  
On 28 April 20I8 evening Shivani, Ameera & Shikha came to the 
farm along with officers of animal husbandry and 6-7 police 
officers. Shivani found a opportune moment and threatened me 
that she will get me killed and said that you must have seen that 
inspite of your trainers 22nd April complaint I have come with the 
police and that I have no status.  
These person can get me killed because of these persons my 
self belief, self respect and self confidence has been totally 
destroyed. My dream was to get a gold medal for India at Olympic 
dressage event, but today these people have snatched 
everything from me.

furthermore 
the 
accused 
Shikha 
Mundkur, Anush Aggarwala and Preeti Aggarwala were not 
examined. ACP is the lncharge of the investigation who has filed 
the action taken report dated 09.07.2018. There is no bar in the 
law that he cannot take assistance of officers of the rank of SI 
S.K. Singh. The written interrogation cannot be held as illegal 
interrogation particularly from the perspective of the complainant, 
however appears to be proper interrogation considering the fact 
that the case is for the preliminary inquiry and not the 
investigation after the registration of the FIR. Furthermore, that 
interrogation was also done in presence of the advocate of the 
complainant, therefore the said ATR cannot be brushed aside on 
the ground of bias and incompetency of the concerned ACP. The 
ACP Rajender Pathania as noticed is the designated officer to 
conduct the inquiries under SC/ST Act.  
 
25. 
On overall consideration of the facts, I do not find any 
reasonable ground to reject the ATR dated 09.07.2018 of ACP 
Rajender Pathania. Therefore, I do not find it fit to issue any 
direction to concerned police u/s 156(3) Cr.P.C. to register FIR 
against the alleged accused namely Anush Aggarwala, Preeti 
Aggarwala, Ameera Pasrich, Ameer Pasrich and Shikha 
Mundkur. 
 
26. 
The respondent in present application u/s 156(3) 
Cr.P.C r/w 200 Cr.P.C is only SHO PS Fatehpur Beri and none 

14 
 
of the alleged accused as mentioned above are made 
respondents/accused in this application/ complaint. The prayer 
clause of this application is only restricted to order of registration 
of FIR. There is nothing prayed in the prayer clause that in the 
alternative to treat this complaint as u/s 200 Cr.P.C for 
examination of the complainant and his witnesses and further to 
proceed with trial as per complaint case.  
 
 
Neither in oral submissions nor in written submissions 
submitted that this matter be treated alternatively as a complaint 
u/s 200 Cr.P.C for the purpose of inquiry and trial.  
 
27. 
Therefore, in these circumstances, this court cannot 
continue proceedings by treating this as complaint case u/s 200 
Cr.P.C. Accordingly, the present application U/s 156(3) Cr.P.C. 
r/w 200 Cr.PC stands dismissed.” 
 
7. 
Respondent No. 2, aggrieved by the order dated 02.08.2018, filed 
Criminal Appeal No. 817/2018 before the High Court of Delhi. On 
28.04.2020, the High Court allowed the Criminal Appeal filed by 
Respondent No. 2, and the operative portion reads as follows: 
“61. Accordingly, to meet the end (sic) of justice, this Court hereby 
directs the SHO of Police Station Fatehpur Beri to register FIR on the 
Complaint made by appellant and after investigation file report as per 
law.  
62. However, no coercive steps shall be taken agains.t the alleged 
accused persons.  
63. Accordingly, impugned order dated 02.08.2018 passed by learned 
Special Judge is hereby set-aside.  
64. In view above, present appeal is allowed and disposed of. 
65. This order be transmitted to the learned counsel/representative of 
the parties. 
66. Pending applications stand also disposed of.”  
 
8. 
By a separate judgment dated 28.04.2020, the High Court directed 
the prosecution of SHO of P.S. Fatehpur Beri under section 4(2)(b) of the 
Act of 1989. The operative portion reads thus: 
“59. Regarding allegations falling under SC/ST Act, the SHO of 
Police Station Fatehpur Beri was duty bound to entertain 
complaint and perform his duty required to be performed under 

15 
 
section 4(1) and 4(2) of the SC/ST Act, however, he failed to do 
so. Moreover, the courts below have ignored the above facts.  
60. In view of above discussion and settled legal position of law 
and statute, this Court is of the view that the then SHO of Police 
Station Fatehpur Beri is liable to be prosecuted under section 
4(2)(b) of SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 as 
amended up-to-date.” 
 
8.1.   The State of GNCT of Delhi and the officers filed Criminal Appeal 
No. 349 of 2021 before this Court against the order dated 28.04.2020 in 
CRL.A. 667/2018 & CRL.M.A. 11836/2018, 2660-61/2020. The said 
Criminal Appeal has been heard as a companion appeal and for 
convenience, disposed of by a separate judgment. Therefore, the instant 
Criminal Appeal is at the instance of Respondent Nos. 2 to 4 in criminal 
appeal No. 817/2018 before the High Court of Delhi.  
9. 
We have heard Mr. Siddharth Luthra, Ld. Senior Advocate for the 
Appellants and Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, Ld. ASG for Respondent No. 1. We 
have also heard from Mr. Kapil Nath Modi, the Ld. Advocate, who is also 
the administrator and supervisor of OREA. Mr. Kapil Modi has been noted 
as a witness on one of the occasions to the casteist slur allegedly made 
by the Appellants at Respondent No. 2. Therefore, a faint objection to Mr. 
Kapil Modi appearing as the Counsel for Respondent No. 2 has been 
raised by Mr. Siddharth Luthra. Mr. Siddharth Luthra in support of his 
objection to Advocate Kapil Modi appearing in the appeal relied on a 
decision reported in Kokkanda B. Poondacha & Ors. v. K.D. Ganapathi 

16 
 
& Anr.1 In reply, Advocate Kapil Modi invited our attention to section 
15A(12) read with section 20 of the Act of 1989 and contended that the 
prescription in either the Advocates Act, 1961 or Bar Council of India 
Rules is subject to the special protection granted by section 15A(12) read 
with section 20 of the Act of 1989 to a victim. To be fair to the Ld. Counsel 
appearing for the parties, allowing Mr. Kapil Modi to appear as Advocate 
for Respondent No. 2, is entirely left open to the discretion of this Court. 
However, as a principle, it may not be understood that we have 
considered the rigor of the Advocates Act read with the Code of Conduct 
on the one hand and section 15A(12) read with section 20 of the Act of 
1989 on the other hand, when we allow Advocate Kapil Modi to appear for 
Respondent No. 2. At this juncture, we advert to an excerpt from 
Kokkanda B. Poondacha (supra), wherein it was observed that: 
“12. …Since the client entrusts the whole obligation of handling 
legal proceedings to an advocate, he has to act according to the 
principles of uberrima fides, i.e., the utmost good faith, integrity, 
fairness, and loyalty.”  
 
Respondent No. 2 rightly believes in Mr. Kapil Modi’s training in an 
equestrian sport and in the effective representation of the case of 
Respondent No. 2. Without deciding the objection raised by the Counsel 
for the Appellants, we have proceeded and heard Mr. Kapil Modi, from 
now on, the Ld. Counsel for Respondent No. 2.  
 
1 (2011) 12 SCC 600.

II. SUBMISSIONS  
10. 
Mr. Siddharth Luthra, firstly, argues that the order under appeal had 
not appreciated the full conspectus of the controversy preceding the filing 
of the complaint dated 29.04.2018 or the application dated 09.05.2018 
before the Ld. Magistrate. The administrator of OREA has encouraged 
Respondent No. 2 to file a complaint alleging the commission of offences 
under the Act of 1989, though none existed over the years. He argues that 
the trainee Appellants and Respondent No. 2 have been trained at OREA, 
and nothing is stated to have happened for years, and everything was 
brought to the fore after the Appellants filed the complaints dated 
03.04.2018 and 11.04.2018 against the administrator. The administrator, 
having been unsuccessful in getting anticipatory bail, etc., in the FIRs filed 
by the Appellants, has pursued or pressurized Respondent No. 2 to initiate 
prosecution by filing a complaint dated 29.04.2018 and the application 
dated 09.05.2018 under the Act of 1989 against the appellants. It is 
argued that these complaints are false and motivated. An attempt has 
been made by inviting our attention to the various complaints filed by the 
Appellants against the administrator of OREA to canvass that Respondent 
No. 2 has been roped in without any grievance vis-à-vis the Appellants. It 
is further argued that a bare reading or perusal of either complaint dated 
29.04.2018 or application dated 09.05.2018 would be sufficiently clear 

18 
 
that no case warranting setting in motion of prosecution under the Act of 
1989 is made out. Secondly, the complaint dated 29.04.2018 and the 
application dated 09.05.2018 do not disclose that an act or omission made 
punishable by any law for the time being in force has been made out. The 
offence alleged against Appellants is stated under section 3(1)(r) and 
3(1)(s) of the Act of 1989. To constitute an offence under section 3(1)(r) 
of the Act of 1989, the complaint must aver that the commission or 
omission has been made in public view. He relied on the decisions 
reported in Hitesh Verma v. State of Uttarakhand & Anr.2, Pramod 
Suryabhan Pawar v. State of Maharashtra & Anr.3 (before this Court), 
State v. Om Prakash Rana & Ors.4, Kusum Lata v. State & Ors.5 and 
Swaran Singh & Ors. v. State & Anr6, to contend on what and when the 
“public view” requirement is satisfied. The instant complaints do not satisfy 
the required ingredients of an offence under the Act of 1989.  
10.1 Thirdly, it is argued that the allegations in the complaints are vague 
and indefinite and do not constitute an offence arising under the Act of 
1989, independent of examination of any other material. Fourthly, it is 
argued that Respondent No. 2 has moved the court under section 156(3) 
of the CrPC. The Action Taken Report discloses that no offence has been 
 
2 (2020) 10 SCC 710. 
3 (2019) 9 SCC 608.  
4 (2013) SCC OnLine Delhi 5107.  
5 (2016) SCC OnLine Del 1379.  
6 (2008) 8 SCC 435.  

19 
 
made out against the Appellants under section 3(1)(r) of the Act of 1989. 
Respondent No. 2 has since moved the court of competent jurisdiction; 
the court of competent jurisdiction is guided by the requirements of section 
156(3) of the CrPC in providing with the matter. In other words, the 
contention proceeds that the Metropolitan Magistrate is expected not to 
act mechanically but apply judicial discretion to the acts complained 
against before directing registration of FIR or closure of the complaint as 
no case is made out.  
10.2 Mr. Siddharth Luthra contends that section 156(3) requires the 
Magistrate to carefully consider and apply its judicious mind and exercise 
its discretion before issuing any directions to the jurisdictional police 
station. If the Magistrate believes there is enough reason to proceed 
immediately, he could issue directions under section 156(3) for the 
registration of an FIR; on the contrary, if the allegations as made, require 
calling for a report, the Magistrate is enabled by the discretion in section 
156(3) to call for a report. In support, he relies on the following 
judgements:  
(1) 
Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd. v. State of Gujarat7: 
“22.1. The direction under Section 156(3) is to be issued only 
after application of mind by the Magistrate. When the Magistrate 
does not take cognizance and does not find it necessary to 
postpone the issuance of process and finds a case made out to 
proceed forthwith, direction under the said provision is issued. In 
other words, where on account of credibility of information 
 
7 (2015) 6 SCC 439.  

20 
 
available, or weighing the interest of justice it is considered 
appropriate to straightaway direct investigation, such a direction 
is issued.” 
 
(2) 
Kailash Vijayvargiya v. Rajlakshmi Chaudhuri8:  
“83. We were informed that the Magistrate, on remand, has 
passed an order under Section 156(3) directing registration of the 
FIR. He has misread the order and directions given by the High 
Court. In terms of the judgments of this Court, the Magistrate is 
required to examine, apply his judicious mind and then exercise 
discretion whether or not to issue directions under Section 156(3) 
or whether he should take cognizance and follow the procedure 
under Section 202. He can also direct a preliminary inquiry by the 
Police in terms of the law laid down by this Court in Lalita Kumari 
(supra).” 
 
10.3 Fifthly, the allegations, even going by the tenor of respective 
complaints, are not made in public view, no third party or a witness has 
heard or seen any of the acts complained against the Appellants. 
Respondent No. 2, for a reason easily discernable, introduces the 
administrator and Cdr. Kuldeepak Mittal as witnesses to several incidents 
spreading over two years. The Counsel commends to the Court to 
juxtapose the primary complaint, requirements of the Act of 1989 and 
section 156(3) of the CrPC and decide whether any semblance of an 
offence is made out warranting registration of FIR/investigation, etc., 
under the Act of 1989 against the Appellants. If the ingredients of an 
offence under section 3(1)(r) of the Act of 1989 are made out, there is no 
gainsaying in drawing inferences on the innocence or otherwise of a 
person accused of these offences at this stage. In such cases, the motion 
 
8 2023 SCC OnLine SC 569.  

21 
 
set in for prosecution must reach its logical end. The registration of an 
FIR, investigation and prosecution result in consequences for the accused 
who are called upon to face investigation and trial, in spite of no charge/ 
offence being made out from the bare perusal of the complaint. Hence, 
the Ld. Trial Judge was correct in rejecting the application dated 
09.05.2018. specifically adverting to the “Alliance” WhatsApp group chat, 
he argues that the sharing of views on this application cannot be 
construed as “public view” and, secondly, the WhatsApp conversation 
prima facie does not attract any of the ingredients constituting an offence 
under section 3(1)(r) of the Act of 1989. The Ld. Counsel argues that the 
entire WhatsApp conversation read together, no offence either under the 
Indian Penal Code, 1860 or the Act of 1989 is made out. At best, the chat 
reflects the immaturity of a few of the members of the “Alliance” WhatsApp 
group.  The word ‘faggot’ means a male homosexual but not a casteist 
slur intended by the Act of 1989.  
11. 
Mr. Kapil Modi, per contra, argues that a casteist remark, is 
punishable under the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The Parliament, realizing 
the need to protect the marginalized sections of the Indian society from 
caste slurs or abetment of offences against people and property, enacted 
the Act of 1989. Respondent No. 2 is a standalone and one in several 
million SC/ST citizens of the country aspiring to win a gold medal in 
dressage in the Olympics. The complaint dated 29.04.2018 does disclose 

22 
 
cognizable offences under the Act of 1989. The grievances of Respondent 
No. 2 made through Complaint dated 29.04.2018 fell on deaf ears of the 
police; when the recourse to section 156(3) of the CrPC was made, the 
Court of Metropolitan Magistrate through the order dated 09.07.2018, 
rendered the prosecution of an offence under the Act of 1989 just 
impossible. He asserts that the theory of the counter case by Respondent 
No. 2 for the cause of the administrator, etc., is yet another species 
employed to defeat the complaints. Ld. Counsel argues that this Court 
considers the complaints dated 29.04.2018 and 09.05.2018 and the 
relevant material to appreciate the offence complained against the 
Appellants herein. For a judicious consideration, the allegations in other 
FIRs are not looked into or examined by this Court in deciding whether an 
offence is made out.  
11.1 Secondly, the appeals have been filed, either by suppressing 
material circumstances or by setting out the narrative in a misleading way. 
Thirdly, the order dated 09.07.2018 of the Metropolitan Magistrate is 
contrary to the tests of judicial discretion laid down by this Court under 
section 156(3) of the CrPC. The Trial Court records a finding as if no 
offence has been made out even without conducting a mini trial in the 
matter. Respondent No. 2, considering his background, suffered in silence 
the slurs alleged at him for months and years, and filed the complaint and 
application on 29.04.2018 and 09.05.2018, respectively, so the delay, 

23 
 
would not lead to any adverse inference on the alleged commission of an 
offence under section 3(1)(r) of the Act of 1989. The argument on “public 
view” as sine qua non for attracting section 3(1)(r) is untenable in the 
circumstances of the case. Although OREA is a private training institute, 
the utterances satisfy as having been made within the academy. 
Therefore, these utterances once are made in OREA satisfy as having 
been made in public view. The absence of names of witnesses or the 
public who witnessed this slur is not fatal. During the investigation, the 
names of witnesses can be stated. Respondent No. 2 filed a complaint, 
which prima facie satisfies the requirements of an offence under section 
3(1)(r) of the Act of 1989. The non-mentioning of witnesses who were 
present when these slurs and insidious comments were made is not fatal 
to the registration of FIR against the Appellants. The averments in the 
complaints are not ambiguous, indefinite or uncertain. The WhatsApp chat 
is also in the public domain, and Daksh Mittal is a third party. Daksh Mittal 
knows these slurs and knowing amounts to an allegation made in public 
view. He relies on judgements in Union of India v. State of Maharashtra 
& Ors.9, National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights & Ors. v. Union 
 
9 (2020) 4 SCC 761.  

24 
 
of India and Ors.10 and Prithvi Raj Chauhan v. Union of India & Ors.11 
and prays for dismissing the appeal.  
12. 
We have taken note of the rival submissions and perused the record 
relevant to the issue arising under the Act of 1989. The above raises the 
following points for our decision: 
 
A. 
Whether the order dated 09.07.2018 of the Metropolitan 
Magistrate conforms to the material on record and satisfies the 
mandate of section 156(3) of the CrPC? 
 
B. 
Whether the complaint(s) dated 29.04.2018/09.05.2018 make 
out a prima facie case of an offence under section 3(1)(r) and 
3(1)(s) of the Act 1989? 
 
 
C. 
Whether the impugned order is valid, legal and tenable in the 
facts and circumstances of the case?

11 (2020) 4 SCC 727.

III. 
ANALYSIS 
13. 
On 20.03.2018, this Court delivered judgment in Dr. Subhash 
Kashinath Mahajan v. the State of Maharashtra & Anr.12 In Union of 
India v. State of Maharashtra13, the directions in Dr. Subhash 
Kashinath Mahajan (supra) have been substantially reviewed/modified. 
In the interregnum, the Parliament stepped in and made the amendments 
vide the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of 
Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2018 (for short, “Act No. 27 of 2018”) to the 
parent act.   
14. 
The statutory scheme under the Act of 1989, through Act No. 27 of 
2018, has undergone a few major changes. Section 18A is one of the 
sections that has a bearing on the procedure followed by the Trial Court 
and needs to be appreciated. Section 18A of the Act of 1989 came into 
effect on 20.08.2018. In the instant appeal, as already noticed, the alleged 
complaints were made between 29.04.2018 and 02.08.2018, and refer to 
the allegation made two years prior to the complaints.  Respondent No. 2, 
by moving the application under section 156(3) of the CrPC invoked the 
jurisdiction of the Magistrate and therefore, the procedure and 
 
12 AIR 2018 SC 1498.  
13 (2020) 4 SCC 761.  

26 
 
requirements of section 156(3) are attracted in examining the correctness 
of the order impugned.  
14.1 Let us examine the discretion and jurisdiction of a Magistrate on the 
application filed under section 156(3), CrPC. Whether the Magistrate has 
to act and accept mechanically a complaint presented to him and direct 
registration of FIR or in his discretion, upon the examination of allegations 
order preliminary enquiry then proceed in the matter. The answer to the 
question centres around section 156(3) of the CrPC. The position in law 
is fairly well-settled and we advert to a few decisions on the point. In 
Priyanka Srivastava & Anr. v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors.14, this 
Court observed that the Magistrate can look into the veracity of an 
application under section 156(3) because ordering inquiry requires the 
application of judicial mind and affidavit by the applicant and has held 
thus:  
“30. 
In our considered opinion, a stage has come in this 
country where Section 156(3) of the CrPC applications are to be 
supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the applicant who seeks 
the jurisdiction of the Magistrate. That apart, in an appropriate 
case, the Ld. Magistrate would be well advised to verify the truth 
and also verify the veracity of the allegations. This affidavit can 
make the applicant more responsible. We are compelled to say 
so as such kind of applications are being filed in a routine manner 
without taking any responsibility whatsoever, only to harass 
certain persons…” 
 
  
 
14 2015 6 SCC 287.  

27 
 
14.2 In Khalid Khan & Anr. v. State of U.P. & Anr.15, dealing with a 
converse situation, the High Court of Judicature of Allahabad observed 
that when the application under section 156(3) of the CrPC discloses the 
commission of a cognizable offence, then the concerned Magistrate must 
direct the registration of the FIR. Under the provisions of section 156(3) of 
the CrPC, a Judicial Magistrate has the discretion to direct a preliminary 
inquiry before ordering the registration of the FIR in cases where no 
cognizable offence is made out. Referring to Priyanka Srivastava 
(supra), the High Court highlighted the importance of verifying the veracity 
of allegations levelled in a complaint to keep in check the filing of 
applications under section 156(3) as a tool to harass people. Thus, from 
the above judgments, it is crystal clear when the application under section 
156(3) of CrPC discloses a cognizable offence, then it is the duty of the 
concerned Magistrate to direct registration of the FIR, which is 
investigated by the investigation agency, in accordance with the law. 
Conversely, when the information received does not prima facie disclose 
the commission of a cognizable offence, but indicates the necessity for 
inquiry, in that case, the preliminary inquiry may be conducted in order to 
ascertain whether the offence complained is cognizable or not. The 
purpose of the preliminary inquiry is not to verify the veracity or otherwise 
 
15 (2023) SCC OnLine All 2277.  

28 
 
of the information received but only to ascertain whether the information 
received reveals a cognizable offence or not. 
14.3 We do not propose to multiply citations on the point and succinctly 
stated, the Magistrate, under section 156(3) of the CrPC, asks himself a 
question: whether the complaint, as presented, makes out a case for 
directing the registration of an FIR or calls for inquiry or report from the 
jurisdictional police station. The inner and outer limit of the exercise of this 
jurisdiction is on a case-to-case basis dependent on the complaint, nature 
of allegations and offence set out by such a complaint. Therefore, it is 
fairly well-settled and axiomatic by the decisions rendered under section 
156(3) of the CrPC that the Magistrate does not act mechanically and 
exercises his discretion judiciously by applying mind to the circumstances 
complained of and the offence alleged against the accused for taking one 
or the other step. The case on hand principally concerns deciding whether 
the discretion is invalidly exercised by the Magistrate while ordering a 
report from the SHO.  
15. 
From careful consideration of material between 29.04.2018 and the 
application dated 09.05.2018 read with the Action Taken Report, we are 
of the considered view that the Metropolitan Magistrate did not commit an 
illegality or irregularity seeking preliminary inquiry or receiving the Action 
Taken Report from the jurisdictional police station. It is further noted that 
the controversy before the High Court in Crl. A. 817/2018 was whether the 

29 
 
Metropolitan Magistrate was legally correct in ordering a preliminary 
inquiry and the Action Taken Report on the application dated 09.05.2018, 
is vitiated or not. The impugned judgement has expanded the discussion 
and recorded a few findings, which are not need at all. Therefore, the order 
of the Magistrate calling upon a report in the circumstances set out above 
is legal.  
16. 
The answer to Point-A would not decide the outcome of the appeal. 
This Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the 
Constitution of India, ensures that not only the initiation of the criminal 
process is continued in just and deserving cases, but also avoids initiation 
of criminal process where the material does not disclose a prima facie 
case. What begs the question is that assuming, for deliberation, that the 
Metropolitan Magistrate was procedurally correct in ordering an inquiry or 
receiving the Action Taken Report; still this Court examines whether the 
complaint makes out a cognizable offence under the Act of 1989, and by 
accepting the report, the Magistrate has aborted the investigation and trial 
on the complaint dated 09.05.2018? The answer to the said question 
depends on the very material relied on by the complainant.  
17. 
With the above perspective, we will refer to the allegations against 
each one of the Appellants as made in the complaints. The following 
tabular statement is prepared for a quick understanding of the offences 
specifically and generally alleged against the Appellants:

There cannot be two views on the proposition that to cause or 
register an FIR and consequential investigation based on the same 
petition filed under section 156(3) of the CrPC, the complaint satisfies the 
essential ingredients of the offences alleged. In other words, if such 
allegations in the petition are vague and do not specify the alleged 
offences, it cannot lead to an order for registration of an FIR and 
investigation.  
18.1 In National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (supra) and Union 
of India v. State of Maharashtra (supra), this Court has held that the 
constitutional goal of equality for all citizens of this country can be 
achieved only when the rights of members of the Scheduled Castes and 
Scheduled Tribes are protected. The prosecution machinery and 
adjudicatory bodies work to achieve this constitutional goal. The FIR 
registered and investigation must be taken forward subject to the 
complaint satisfying the requirements of an offence complained under the 

32 
 
Act of 1989. See Usha Chakraborty & Anr. v. State of West Bengal & 
Anr.16: 
“10. …There cannot be any doubt with respect to the position that 
in order to cause registration of an F.I.R. and consequential 
investigation based on the same the petition filed under Section 
156(3), Cr.P.C., must satisfy the essential ingredients to attract 
the alleged offences. In other words, if such allegations in the 
petition are vague and are not specific with respect to the alleged 
offences it cannot lead to an order for registration of an F.I.R. and 
investigation on the accusation of commission of the offences 
alleged…” 
 
19. 
Sections 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the Act of 1989 read thus:  
“3. Punishments for offences of atrocities- (1) Whoever, not 
being a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe,-  
 
xxx xxx 
xxx xxx 
 
(r) intentionally insults or intimidates with the intent to humiliate a 
member of the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe in any place 
with public view.   
 
(s) abuses any member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled 
Tribe by caste name in any place 
within public view;” 
 
19.1 Section 3(1)(r) 
Section 3(1)(r) makes an intentional insult or intimidation intended to 
humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in any 
place within public view an offence. Structured in the golden rule of 
interpretation, this section flows as follows:  
i. 
Intentionally insults or intimidates. 
 
16 (2023) SCC OnLine SC 90.  

33 
 
ii. 
With intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a 
Scheduled Tribe. 
iii. 
In a place within public view.  
19.2 Section 3(1)(s) 
i. 
Abuses any member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe.  
ii. 
By caste name.   
iii. 
In any place within public view.  
20. 
The cumulative effect of the structured application to a given 
situation is that the intentional insult or abuse coupled with the humiliation 
is made in any place within public view. The expression “in any place 
within public view” has an important role to play in deciding whether the 
allegation attracts the ingredients of an offence or not, and has been the 
subject matter of consideration in the following decisions:  
(1) 
Swaran Singh (supra)- 
“28. It has been alleged in the FIR that Vinod Nagar, the first 
informant, was insulted by Appellants 2 and 3 (by calling him a 
“chamar”) when he stood near the car which was parked at the 
gate of the premises. In our opinion, this was certainly a place 
within public view since the gate of a house is certainly a place 
within public view. It could have been a different matter had the 
alleged offence been committed inside a building and also was 
not in the public view. However, if the offence is committed 
outside the building e.g. in a lawn outside a house, and the lawn 
can be seen by someone from the road or lane outside the 
boundary wall, the lawn would certainly be a place within the 
public view. Also, even if the remark is made inside a building, 
but some members of the public are there (not merely relatives 
or friends) then also it would be an offence since it is in the public 
view. We must, therefore, not confuse the expression “place 
within public view” with the expression “public place”. A place can 
be a private place but yet within the public view. On the other 

34 
 
hand, a public place would ordinarily mean a place which is 
owned or leased by the Government or the municipality (or other 
local body) or gaon sabha or an instrumentality of the State, and 
not by private persons or private bodies.” 
 
(2) 
Daya Bhatnagar & Ors. v. State17-  
“19. The SC/ST Act was enacted with a laudable object to protect 
vulnerable section of the society. Sub-clauses (i) to (xv) of 
Section 3(1) of the Act enumerate various kinds of atrocities that 
might be perpetrated against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled 
Tribes, which constitute an offence. However, Sub-clause (x) is 
the only clause where even offending “utterances” have been 
made punishable. The Legislature required ‘intention’ as an 
essential ingredient for the offence of ‘insult’, ‘intimidation’ and 
‘humiliation’ of a member of the Scheduled Casts or Scheduled 
Tribe in any place within ‘public view’. Offences under the Act are 
quite grave and provide stringent punishments. Graver is the 
offence, stronger should be the proof. The interpretation which 
suppresses or evades the mischief and advances the object of 
the Act has to be adopted. Keeping this in view, looking to the 
aims and objects of the Act, the expression “public view” in 
Section 3(1)(x) of the Act has to be interpreted to mean that the 
public persons present, (howsoever small number it may be), 
should be independent and impartial and not interested in any of 
the parties. In other words, persons having any kind of close 
relationship or association with the complainant, would 
necessarily get excluded.”

Pramod Suryabhan Pawar v. State of Maharashtra 
(before the High Court of Bombay)18- 
 
“17. Requirement of section 3(1)(x) of the old Act is intentional 
insult and intimidation with intent to humiliate the person 
belonging to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe in any place 
within public view. Messages sent on whatsapp cannot be said 
to be an act of intentional insult or intimidation or an intent to 
humiliate in public place within public view. As such it is prima 
facie seen that no offence under the provisions of the Scheduled 
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 
1989 is attracted in the case in hand.” 
 
 
17 (2004) SCC OnLine Del 33.  
18 2016 SCC OnLine Bom 15947.  

35 
 
21. 
Bearing in mind, the above interpretation, we examine and sum up 
the factual position as follows: 
The accusation of intentionally abusing and humiliating Respondent No. 
2 spans over a period of two years between 2016 and 2018. The allegation 
prima facie appears to be an omnibus and ambiguous allegation. The 
specific allegation in the complaint on Appellant No. 2 is that Appellant 
No. 2 called Respondent No. 2 “chuda”, “chamar”, “chakka” and “faggot”. 
The allegation does not refer to the place nor the public view before whom 
it was made.  
21.1 Respondent No. 2 alleges that Appellant No. 1 made an insinuating 
casteist remark during the International Dressage Development League 
(IDDL) competitions. The Court ought not to be searching for a complete 
description of the accusation in a matter such as the present, but the 
litmus test is the date, time, and year when the incident said to have 
happened.  
21.2 Appellant No. 4 is accused of humiliating Respondent No. 2 with a 
casteist remark allegedly on 17th December. The date is stated, but the 
year is not stated, leaving one to infer whether these remarks were made 
in 2016 or 2017. The accusation against Appellant No. 3 and Appellant 
No. 6 do not refer to a casteist slur but refer to abuses hurled at 
Respondent No. 2.  

36 
 
22. 
The above ex-facie consideration of accusations is kept in our 
perspective and we also take note of the change made to the allegations 
in the application filed before the Metropolitan Magistrate under section 
156(3) on 09.05.2018. The marked change in incorporation of the words 
‘public place’, in the application filed before the Metropolitan Magistrate. 
The improvement, at best, may be a verbatim reproduction of the 
language of section 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the Act of 1989. An important 
test for “in any place within public view” is within the view of persons other 
than the complainant. In this case, we are not examining whether OREA 
is a private or public place, but to appreciate the alleged offence. We 
juxtapose the allegation(s) with the requirement of insulting or intimidating 
in any place within public view is satisfied or not. These allegations read 
together or individually do not satisfy the requirement of having been 
made in public view. Serial Nos. 1-4 in the tabular statement intend to 
attract the offences punishable under the Act of 1989. Serial Nos. 5-7 
cannot by any interpretation, whether as standalone or in the company of 
other allegations, be related to an offence under the Act of 1989.  
23. 
The other allegation in the complaint is regarding the 
chat/conversation of the “Alliance” WhatsApp group members. In Pramod 
Suryabhan Pawar (supra; before this Court), this Court dealt with a 
chat between the complainant and the accused on WhatsApp and 

37 
 
considered the effect of the conversation whether it was in public view or 
not. The relevant portion reads thus:  
“23. Without entering into a detailed analysis of the content of the 
WhatsApp messages sent by the appellant and the words 
alleged to have been spoken, it is apparent that none of the 
offences set out above are made out. The messages were not in 
public view, no assault occurred, nor was the appellant in such a 
position so as to dominate the will of the complainant. Therefore, 
even if the allegations set out by the complainant with respect to 
the WhatsApp messages and words uttered are accepted on 
their face, no offence is made out under the SC/ST Act (as it then 
stood). The allegations on the face of the FIR do not hence 
establish the commission of the offences alleged.” 
 
24. 
After appreciating the allegation on the exchange of WhatsApp 
messages in the group, we are not deciding on whether these allegations 
were made in public view or not but examine on the intrinsic element of 
the very accusation covering this aspect of the matter. At the cost of 
repetition, we quote the very sentence from the complaint: 
“…International insult and Humiliation by, Anush Agarwalla on 
many occasions has publicly abused me by calling me “chuda, 
Chamar, chakka and faggot. 
xxx xxx 
xxx xxx 
 
International insult and humiliation by Shikha Mundkur and 
Ameera Pasrich: On 28January 2018 I was riding a horse called 
"xanthos". When Shikha and Ameera saw me riding the horse, 
they both ran towards me hurling abuses at me and pushed me 
off the horse, they spat on me and said "you bloody mother 
fucking faggot if you ever dare to ride a horse again then it will 
have very bad consequences…" 
 
25. 
The insinuation/slur does not cover ingredients of section 3(1)(r) or 
3(1)(s) of the Act of 1989. The said word does not take within its fold any 
of the commissions or omissions made penal by the Act of 1989. 

38 
 
25.1 In his jurisdiction, the Metropolitan Magistrate examined the 
allegations and the requirements of law from this perspective. Let us now 
refer to the operative part of the Action Taken Report dated 09.07.2018: 
“During course of enquiry, statement of Mr. Amir Pasrich his wife 
Ms. Shivani Pasrich and Ameera Pasrich were recorded. 
Complainant Mr. Praveen @ Prashant was also enquired to 
verify the facts mentioned in the complaint. No witness named by 
the complainant in complainant (sic) or in the statement in 
respect of above allegations, there is no apparent intent to 
humiliate a member of SC/ST in any place within Public view. 
Allegation of threats are not made out in presence of Police 
personnel as per complaint and upon investigation found that 
those Police Staff did accompany complainants along with 
animal husbandry department officials of the inspection horses 
regarding the investigation of Case FIR No. 134/2018 and 
135/2018. 
 
It is also pertinent to mention that the Case FIR No. 134 and 135 
of 2018 U/s 354A/509 IPC were registered against Mr. Kapil Modi 
on 21/04/2018 on the complaint of Ms. Ameera Pasrich and Ms. 
Shikha Mundkar respectively. Just after one day of the 
registration of said FIR's on 22/04/2018, complaint of Mr. Kapil 
Modi was received at Police Station and complaint of 
Complainant Mr. Praveen Kumar @ Prashaht was filed on 
02/05/2018, almost after 3 months of the alleged incidents of 
casteism remarks. WhatsApp group information and review 
reveals 2 young teenagers, One young adult and one minor in 
casual quick conversations not pursuing dangerous plans. 
Complaint had submitted short extract version of conversation 
without full chat records. 
 
On the basis of material on record and the statements of the 
parties concerned, the allegations leveled by the complainant 
could not be substantiated. The complaint seems to have been 
filed after thought to counter the criminal cases filed by Ms. 
Ameera Pasrich 
and Ms. Shikha Mundkar against the trainer of the complainant 
Mr. Kapil Modi. Therefore, from the enquiry carried out prima 
facie no case was made out under the 
provision of SC/ST Prevention of Atrocity Act. 
 
With regard to the application for action for delay in enquiry/non 
registration of FIR, the matter has already been dismissed by the 
Hon'ble Court of ASJ Sh. A.K.Jain of Saket Courts vide order 
dated 05/06/2018. The appeal filed by the present applicant 

39 
 
before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court against this order is still 
pending and is placed on hearing on 25/07/2018. 
 
However, any direction of this Hon'ble Court will be complied with 
meticulously.” 
 
26. 
From the above consideration, the available conclusion is that firstly, 
the Metropolitan Magistrate at the relevant point of time was justified in 
ordering a preliminary inquiry on the application dated 09.05.2018 and 
receiving the Action Taken Report from the jurisdictional police station. 
Further, the accusations in the complaints do not satisfy as having been 
made in any place within public view. Therefore, in a case such as the 
present, directing registration of FIR and further steps is unsustainable. 
Points A and B are answered in favour of the Appellants.  
27. 
We have perused the judgment under appeal and the voluminous 
record filed by the contesting parties to support their respective 
contentions. Having gone through the record, by a judicious exclusion of 
material, we do not propose to delve into the reasons assigned by the 
judgment under appeal or the material relied on by the contesting parties. 
The observations of the High Court of Delhi directing the registration of an 
FIR, for the reasons we have recorded in the preceding paragraphs is 
untenable and warrants interference in the appeal. Accordingly, Point C is 
answered in favor of the Appellants and consequently, the impugned 
judgement is held unsustainable.  

40 
 
28. 
By looking at the number of cases filed, acrimonious allegations and 
counter-allegations made between parties, a doubt arises whether 
someone who cannot calm oneself can calm and guide a horse in the 
horse’s 
enthusiasm 
to 
perform 
each 
element 
with 
minimum 
encouragement from the rider and be an equestrian. We leave it to the 
passion and path of the parties.  
29. 
For the above reasons and discussion, the criminal appeal stands 
allowed, and the order of the Metropolitan Magistrate dated 09.07.2018 is 
upheld.

The instant Criminal Appeal has been tagged and taken up for

examined in both the Appeals are same. But for convenience, separate 
judgments are delivered. 
2. 
On 29.04.2018, the respondent lodged a complaint before the 
Station House Office, P.S. Fatehpur Beri, New Delhi (for short, “the 
SHO”). The complaint dated 29.04.2018 narrates alleged offences under 
the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 
1989 (for short, “the Act of 1989”) against Preeti Agarwalla, Anush 
Agarwalla, Shikha Mundkur, Amir Pasrich, Shivani Pasrich and Ameera 

2 
Pasrich (Appellant Nos. 1 to 6, respectively, in Criminal Appeal No. 348 of 
2021). On 09.05.2018, the respondent filed an application under section 
156(3), read with section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for 
short, “the CrPC”), before the Ld. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, South 
Saket Court, to direct registration of an FIR on the complaint dated 
29.04.2018.  
2.1 
The Respondent, on 25.05.2018, filed a Criminal Miscellaneous 
Application under sections 4(2) and 4(3) of the Act of 1989 before the 
Special Court of Shri Ajay Kumar Jain, Special Judge, New Delhi and is 
directed against the Special Commissioner of Police, Southern Range (for 
short, “Spl. CP”) etc. for registering an FIR and action as deemed just and 
proper, is taken in accordance with the Act of 1989. In effect and 
substance, the subject application deals with the alleged commissions 
and omissions by public servants in the discharge of the duties and 
functions under the Act of 1989. The miscellaneous application has been 
numbered as C.T. No. 536/2018. To wit, the respondent impleaded the 
Spl. CP, the SHO, P.S. Fatehpur Beri, and Shri Anurag Das, the Ld. 
Metropolitan Magistrate (South), Saket Court, New Delhi, as respondents 
in the application under Section 4 of the Act 1989 for initiating prosecution 
against them. The application alleges that the public servants neglected 
the duties and functions assigned to them by the Act of 1989, viz. register 
an FIR on the information lodged on 29.04.2018, investigate the 

3 
allegations and take prompt and timely action, by keeping in perspective 
the scope and object of the Act of 1989. It would be apposite to refer to 
the allegations, without diminishing or diluting the grievance stated in C.T. 
No. 536/2018 by the sole respondent, against the public servants as 
precisely as possible for our consideration:  
(i) 
The application alleges that the SHO and staff, allegedly influenced 
by Amir Pasrich, accused in the complaint dated 29.04.2018, refused to 
acknowledge the respondent’s complaint dated 29.04.2018. The multiple 
representations said to have been made by the respondent, to all the 
concerned, after the purported refusal to register the complaint are stated 
in the application. During the proceedings, the Metropolitan Magistrate 
vide order dated 22.05.2018 instructed the SHO to submit an Action 
Taken Report, scheduling the next date of hearing of the application filed 
under section 156(3) of the CrPC for 19.07.2018. The respondent, after 
being dissatisfied with the next date of the hearing, applied for an urgent 
hearing. On 24.05.2018, the respondent was heard, but the Metropolitan 
Magistrate dismissed the request for dasti. The respondent, then, filed the 
application under section 4 for the registration of an FIR against the public 
servants. 
(ii) 
Vide order dated 05.06.2018, the Ld. ASJ, Special Judge, Saket, 
disposed of the respondent’s application under section 4 of the Act of 
1989. The ASJ observed that in substance, the respondent's grievance 

4 
was that the Metropolitan Magistrate did not order the registration of FIR 
and refused to prepone the matter for filing the Action Taken Report. In 
this background, it is noticed, that a judicial remedy cannot be sought 
against the Spl. CP and SHO, P.S. Fatehpur Beri, since they are not 
judicial officers. The respondent, aggrieved by the rejection of prayer, filed 
an appeal under section 14A before the High Court of Delhi, praying to call 
the records of C.T. No. 536/2018 and CC No. 24/01 for perusal, citing the 
imminent threat of acid attack again. 
3. 
By Order dated 05.07.2018, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate 
transferred the application dated 09.05.2018 filed by the Respondent 
under section 156(3) read with section 200 of the CrPC from the Court of 
Shri Anurag Das, Metropolitan Magistrate to the Court of Shri Gaurav 
Gupta, Metropolitan Magistrate. On 06.07.2018, the Metropolitan 
Magistrate directed the Assistant Commissioner of Police (for short, 
“ACP”) to furnish the enquiry report on the complaint dated 09.05.2018 of 
the respondent. On 09.07.2018, the ACP filed an Action Taken Report. By 
Order dated 02.08.2018, the application dated 09.05.2018 filed under 
section 156(3) was dismissed by the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate. 
The order dismissing the application was challenged in Crl.A. 817/2018 
before the High Court of Delhi. Through the judgement dated 20.04.2020, 
the criminal appeal was allowed. The accused, aggrieved by the said 
judgment, filed Crl.A. No. 348/2021 in this Court. The Metropolitan 

5 
Magistrate, on the prayers for registering an FIR against the public 
servants, by a separate order dated 05.06.2018 in C.T. No. 536/2018, 
held as under:  
“In this factual scenario, at present stage, I do not find any ground 
to take action u/s 4 SC/ST Act against the respondents as per 
memo of parties ie Spl. CP Southern Range, SHO PS Fatehpur 
Beri and Sh Anurag Das, Ld. MM, South. Hence, the present 
application stands dismissed. However, nothing in this order shall 
be construed as opinion over the merits of allegations levelled by 
the complainant against the alleged accused persons mentioned 
above. Application disposed off accordingly. Copy of this order 
be given dasti. File be consigned to record room.

4. 
Aggrieved by the order dated 05.06.2018, the respondent, on 
06.06.2018, filed Criminal Appeal No. 667/2018 before the High Court of 
Delhi. The Commissioner of Police, Delhi, the Spl. CP, the SHO, P.S. 
Fatehpur Beri and Shri Anurag Das, Metropolitan Magistrate-01, (South) 
Saket Court, New Delhi were added as respondents in the appeal. The 
grounds of challenge were that the dereliction or negligence of the named 
public servants was deliberate and willful, facilitated the accused in the 
main complaint to go scot-free and also defeated the objective of the Act 
of 1989. The grounds of challenge are adverted to hereunder: 
“(i) The public servants wilfully ignore the statutory duty and 
functions under the Act 1989.The dictum in Lalitha Kumari v. 
State of Uttar Pradesh was not followed, while examining the 
complaint dated 29.04.2018. 
 
That on 29-04-2018 at 12.30pm the appellant went  to register 
his police complaint in P.S Fatehpur Beri the police officials 
disgracefully refused to recieve and register the complaint and 
disgracefully turned away the complainanant in the evening the 

6 
appellant again tweets to the Hon'ble PM and others mentioning 
that to register his complaint. 
That because the public servants, SHO  P.S Fatehpur Beri, Spl 
CP Southern Range and commissioner of Police-as well as Shri 
Anurag Das Ld. N.M.01 (South) Saket Court wilfully neglected 
their duties- expected to be performed under section 4(1) & 4(2) 
of the SC &ST (sic of Atrocities) Act 1989 as amended up to 
date, The  appellant filed a complaint case 536/2018 accordingly 
before Shri Ajay Kumar Jain,Ld. ASJ-02(South) Spl Judge Saket 
Court New Delhi on 25- 05-2018 which came up for hearing on 
2.6- 05-2 018, On 26-05-2018 matter was heard by Shri Ajay Kr. 
Jain Ld. ASJ and initially gave a date for 9th July and only after 
intensive pleading from the counsel the date was fixed for 4th 
June for calling of ATR. These acts in fine refer to the alleged 
commissions and ommissions under the Act 1989 by the public 
servants.” 
 
5. 
Through the impugned judgment, the criminal appeal filed by the 
respondent stood allowed, and the operative portion reads thus:  
“57. This Court is conscious of the fact that the complaint in 
question was dated 29.04.2018, however, as per the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court in case of Dr. Subhash Kashinath Mahajan (supra) dated 
20.03.2018, the Police was not supposed to register FIR straightway, 
if allegations are falling under section SC/ST Act, but after enquiry if 
prima facie case is made out. The said directions were in operation till 
Parliament had brought amendment and said directions were 
reviewed on 010.10.2019 01.10.2019 by the Hon'ble  Supreme Court. 
As per directions dated 20.03.2018 of the Supreme Court in Dr. 
Subhash Kashinath Mahajan (supra), preliminary enquiry must be 
conducted within 7 days, whereas in the present case, enquiry report 
was submitted by the ACP on 18.06.2018 i.e. after 59 days.  
58. In view of above facts, it is not in dispute that during the sun-set 
period, on the allegations falls under SC/ST Act, preliminary enquiry 
was to be conducted but for other allegations and there was no 
embargo to register FIR. On perusal of complaint dated 29.04.2018, 
there are allegations falling the other offences of IPC. But, the then 
SHO of Police Station Fatehpur Beri failed to register FIR for other 
offences, not under SC/ST Act.  
59. Regarding allegations falling under SC/ST Act, the SHO of 
Police Station Fatehpur Beri was duty bound to entertain complaint 
and perform his duty required to be performed under section 4(1) and 
4(2) of the SC/ST Act, however, he failed to do so. Moreover, the 
courts below have ignored the above facts.  
60. In view of above discussion and settled legal position of law and 
statute, this Court is of the view that the then SHO of Police Station 
Fatehpur Beri is liable to be prosecuted under section 4(2)(b) of SC & 
ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 as amended up-to-date. 

7 
61. Accordingly, the impugned order dated 05.06.2018 is hereby 
set aside and Trial Court is directed to initiate proceedings against the 
then SHO of Police Station Fatehpur Beri as per law, however, no 
coercive steps shall be taken against the above said alleged accused. 
62. In view of above, present appeal is allowed and disposed of. 
63. This order be transmitted to learned counsel/representative for 
the parties. 
64. A copy of this order be transmitted to the learned Trial Court for 
information and compliance. 
 
CRL.M.As.11836/2018 & 2660-6112/2020  
65. In view of the order passed in the present petition, these 
applications have been rendered infructuous and are accordingly, 
disposed of.” 
  
6. 
The State and the respondents in Criminal Appeal No. 667 of 2018, 
hence, filed the instant appeal.  
7. 
The Ld. Additional Solicitor General, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, 
appearing for the Appellants contends that the direction in the impugned 
judgment, calling upon the SHO to register FIR against the then SHO, 
P.S. Fatehpur Beri, is illegal, untenable and contrary to the mandate of 
section 4 of the Act of 1989. The direction to initiate proceedings against 
the then SHO of P.S. Fatehpur Beri ignores the inbuilt protection of section 
4 available to a public servant. 
7.1 It is vehemently argued that before initiating the proceedings, the 
viewpoint of the then SHO, P.S. Fatehpur Beri, on the alleged dereliction 
of duty or function should have been enquired into. 
7.2 There has been a denial of opportunity to the public servant and in 
essence, the principles of natural justice are also violated. 

8 
7.3 The mechanism under section 4 of the Act of 1989 is firstly to 
undertake an administrative enquiry by the competent authority and arrive 
at a recommendation for initiating legal proceedings against the negligent 
public servant. In the case on hand, the application was moved before the 
court, and the Trial Court did not find a reason to order a departmental 
enquiry or initiate proceedings against the public servants named in CT. 
No. 536/2018. However, the High Court of Delhi examined each one of 
the dates and events narrated in the applications and recorded a finding 
on the public servant, resulting in a direction to initiate proceedings 
against the then SHO, P.S. Fatehpur Beri. The procedure followed is 
contrary to section 4 of the Act of 1989. Ms. Aishwarya Bhati made a few 
submissions on merits against the impugned judgment. For the present 
consideration, we are of the view that the contentions on merits, if need 
be, are adverted to and decided.   
8. 
Mr. Kapil Nath Modi, Ld. Counsel appearing for the sole respondent 
argues that the appeal suffers from serious suppressions on material facts 
and the grounds raised on violation of principles of natural justice by the 
Court below is a convenient plea as well as a concocted version pressed 
before this Court only to avoid facing criminal proceedings for dereliction 
of duty. In the instant appeal, the public servants have deliberately flouted 
the duties and functions under the Act of 1989. Enough prevarications and 
suppressions are stated while invoking the jurisdiction of the Court. 

9 
Section 4 of the Act of 1989 is intended to make the public servants act 
and react to a complaint received under the Act of 1989 strictly in 
accordance with the law. The initiation of criminal proceedings through the 
impugned Judgment is justified, and no exception could be stated. He 
prays for dismissing the appeal.  
9. 
In the accompanying Criminal Appeal No. 348 of 2021, filed by the 
accused, we have referred to the series of complaints and counter-
complaints by the athletes, the administrator of OREA and the 
Respondent herein. We have referred to a few reported judgments of this 
Court on the object achieved by the Act of 1989. For brevity, these 
contentions are not adverted to in the instant judgment.  
10. 
We have perused the record and noted the rival contentions 
canvassed by the Counsel appearing for the parties.   
10.1 In the above narrative, this Court formulates and addresses the 
following two points:  
A. 
Whether initiating proceedings against the then SHO, P.S. 
Fatehpur Beri by the impugned judgment conforms to the 
requirements of section 4 of the Act of 1989?  
B. 
Whether on merits and in the circumstances of the case, the 
impugned direction to initiate proceedings against the then SHO 
is justified and tenable? 

10 
11. 
After careful consideration of the arguments and the record, we are 
of the view that the examination of Point B would be dependent on the 
outcome of Point A.  
12. 
Section 4 of the Act of 1989 has been substituted by the 
Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of 
Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015 (Act No. 1 of 2016). To appreciate 
the change in the procedure, for taking cognizance of an offence 
punishable for the negligence of duty by a public servant, the 
unamended and amended section 4 are excerpted here under:- 
Section 4, Act of 1989 
Section 4, Act of 1989 after 
amendment by Act No. 1 of 2016 
4. Punishment for neglect of duties- 
Whoever, being a public servant but not 
being a member of a Scheduled Caste or 
a Scheduled Tribe, wilfully neglects his 
duties required to be performed by him 
under this Act, shall be punishable with 
imprisonment for a term which shall not 
be less than six months but which may 
extend to one year. 
4. Punishment for neglect of duties- 
(1) Whoever, being a public servant but 
not being a member of a Scheduled 
Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, wilfully 
neglects his duties required to be 
performed by him under this Act and the 
rules 
made 
thereunder, 
shall 
be 
punishable with imprisonment for a term 
which shall not be less than six months 
but which may extend to one year. 
 
(2) The duties of public servant referred 
to in sub-section (1) shall include— 
 
(a) to read out to an informant the 
information 
given 
orally, 
and 
reduced to writing by the officer in 
charge of the police station, before 
taking the signature of the informant; 
(b) to register a complaint or a First 
Information Report under this Act 
and other relevant provisions and to 
register 
it 
under 
appropriate 
sections of this Act; 
(c) to furnish a copy of the information 
so recorded forthwith to the in 
formant; 

11 
(d) to record the statement of the 
victims or witnesses; 
(e) to conduct the investigation and file 
charge sheet in the Special Court or 
the Exclusive Special Court within a 
period of sixty days, and to explain 
the delay if any, in writing; 
(f) to correctly prepare, frame and 
translate any document or electronic 
record; 
(g) to perform any other duty specified 
in this Act or the rules made 
thereunder: 
Provided that the charges in this 
regard against the public servant 
shall 
be 
booked 
on 
the 
recommendation 
of 
an 
administrative enquiry. 
 
(3) The cognizance in respect of any 
dereliction of duty referred to in sub-
section (2) by a public servant shall be 
taken by the Special Court or the 
Exclusive Special Court and shall give 
direction for penal proceedings against 
such public servant. 
 
13. 
Section 4(1), interpreted by the golden rule, has the following facets:  
i. 
Firstly, section 4(1) is meant to operate against a public servant, and 
the threshold requirement is that the public servant shall not be a 
member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe; 
ii. 
Secondly, such a public servant willfully neglects his duties, as 
mandated under the Act of 1989 and the Rules of 1995. 
13.1 Section 4(2) has set out the duties for performance by a public 
servant and sub-section (2) uses the word ‘include’. The word ‘include’ is 
a phrase of extension and not of restrictive connotations. The word 
‘include’ is not equivalent to ‘mean’. The word ‘include’ is very generally 

12 
used in interpretation clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of the words 
or phrases occurring in the body of the statute. [See Dilworth v. 
Commissioner 
of 
Stamps1; 
 
South 
Gujarat 
Roofing 
Tiles 
Manufacturers Association & Anr. v. State of Gujarat & Anr.2; Dadaji 
alias Dina v. Sukhdeobabu & Ors.3].  
13.2 The words and phrases in sub-section (2) must be construed as 
comprehending not only such acts as they signify according to their 
natural import but also those which the interpretation clause declares that 
they shall include. In the case on hand, the dispute is not on whether the 
alleged commission or omission comes within any of the clauses of sub-
section (2) of section 4. The consideration is on the interpretation of the 
proviso to sub-section (2) of section 4 and consequent cognizance under 
section 4(3) of legal proceedings. Conversely, whether cognizance of an 
offence can be directed/carried out without the recommendation of the 
administrative enquiry.   
13.3 In other words, to set in motion the penal proceedings including 
taking cognizance for an offence of commission and omission under 
section 4(2) of the Act of 1989, the recommendation of the administrative 
enquiry is a sine qua non. The proviso is an inbuilt safeguard to the public 
servant from initiation of prosecution by every dissatisfied complainant.

2 (1976) 4 SCC 601. 
3 (1980) 1 SCC 621.  

13 
On appreciation of offences covered by section 3 and the nature of 
offences conversely dealt with under section 4 of the Act of 1989, it is 
noted that a complaint under section 3 presupposes insult, accusation, 
victimization, etc. of a member of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled 
Tribes by a non-Scheduled Caste/Tribe person. However, the commission 
or omission by a public servant is rendered as an offence when the public 
servant contravenes the duties spelt in section 4(2) of the Act of 1989 read 
with the Rules of 1995 and by a recommendation made to that effect. The 
test in an enquiry is whether the public servant willfully neglected the 
duties required to be performed by the public servant under the Act of 
1989 or not.  
13.4 A proviso is a clause that introduces a condition by the word 
‘provided’.4 The main function of a proviso is to put a qualification and to 
attach a condition to the main provision. It indicates the exceptions to the 
provision but may aid in explaining what is meant to be conveyed by its 
part.5 A proviso is “introduced to indicate the effect of certain things which 
are within the statute but accompanied by the peculiar conditions 
embraced within the proviso”.6 A proviso is enacted to modify the 
immediately preceding language. It is apposite while reiterating the 
 
4 Webster’s Second New International Dictionary1995 (1934).

14 
interpretation of a proviso to refer to the recent judgement of this Court in 
Union of India & Ors. v. VKC Footsteps (India) (P) Ltd.7: 
                 “F.4. Construing the proviso 
91. Provisos in a statute have multi-faceted personalities. As 
interpretational principles governing statutes have evolved, 
certain basic ideas have been recognised, while heeding to the 
text and context. Justice G.P. Singh, in his seminal 
text, Principles 
of 
Statutory 
Interpretation [ 
Justice 
G.P. 
Singh, Principles of Statutory Interpretation, (14th Edn., Lexis 
Nexis, 2016) pp. 215-234.] formulates the governing principles of 
interpretation which have been adopted by courts while 
construing a statutory proviso. The first rule of interpretation is 
that: 
“The normal function of a proviso is to except 
something out of the enactment or to qualify 
something enacted therein which but for the 
proviso would be within the purview of the 
enactment. 
As 
stated 
by 
Lush, 
J. 
[Mullins v. Treasurer of the County of Surrey, (1880) 
LR 5 QBD 170] : (QBD p. 173) ‘… When one finds a 
proviso to the section, the natural presumption is that 
but for the proviso the enacting part of the section 
would have included the subject-matter of the 
proviso.’ In the words of Lord Macmillan [Madras & 
Southern Mahratta Railway Co. Ltd. v. Bezwada 
Municipality, 1944 SCC OnLine PC 7] : (SCC OnLine 
PC) ‘… The proper function of a proviso is to except 
and to deal with a case which would otherwise fall 
within the general language of the main enactment, 
and its effect is confined to that case.’ The proviso 
may, 
as 
Lord 
Macnaghten 
[Local 
Govt. 
Board v. South Stoneham Union, 1909 AC 57 (HL)] 
laid down, be ‘a qualification of the preceding 
enactment which is expressed in terms too general to 
be quite accurate’ (AC p. 62). The general rule has 
been stated by Hidayatullah, J. [Shah Bhojraj Kuverji 
Oil Mills & Ginning Factory v. Subbash Chandra 
Yograj Sinha, AIR 1961 SC 1596] , in the following 
words : (AIR p. 1600, para 9) ‘9. … As a general rule, 
a proviso is added to an enactment to qualify or create 
an exception to what is in the enactment, and 
ordinarily, a proviso is not interpreted as stating a 
general rule.’ And in the words of Kapur, J. 
[CIT v. Indo-Mercantile Bank Ltd., AIR 1959 SC 713] : 
(AIR p. 717, para 9) ‘9. … The proper function of a 
proviso is that it qualifies the generality of the main 
 
7 (2022) 2 SCC 603.  

15 
enactment by providing an exception and taking out 
as it were, from the main enactment, a portion which, 
but for the proviso would fall within the main 
enactment.…’ ” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
92. But then these principles are subject to other principles of 
statutory interpretation which may supplement or even substitute 
the above formula. These other rules which have been 
categorised by Justice G.P. Singh are summarised as follows: 
 
92.1. A proviso is not construed as excluding or adding 
something by implication: 
“Except as to cases dealt with by it, a proviso has no 
repercussion on the interpretation of the enacting 
portion of the section so as to exclude something by 
implication which is embraced by clear words in the 
enactment.” [ Justice G.P. Singh, Principles of 
Statutory Interpretation (14th Edn., Lexis Nexis, 2016) 
p. 218.] 
 
92.2. A proviso is construed in relation to the subject-matter of 
the statutory provision to which it is appended: 
“The language of a proviso even if general is normally 
to be construed in relation to the subject-matter 
covered by the section to which the proviso is 
appended. In other words, normally a proviso does not 
travel beyond the provision to which it is a proviso. ‘It 
is a cardinal rule of interpretation’, observed Bhagwati, 
J. [Ram Narain Sons Ltd. v. CST, AIR 1955 SC 765, 
p. 769, para 10] , ‘that a proviso to a particular 
provision of a statute only embraces the field which is 
covered by the main provision. It carves out an 
exception to the main provision to which it has been 
enacted as a proviso and to no other.’ ” [ Justice G.P. 
Singh, Principles of Statutory Interpretation (14th 
Edn., Lexis Nexis, 2016) p. 221.] 
 
92.3. Where the substantive provision of a statute lacks clarity, a 
proviso may shed light on its true meaning: 
“If the enacting portion of a section is not clear, a 
proviso appended to it may give an indication as its 
true meaning. As stated by Lord Herschell [West 
Derby Union v. Metropolitan Life Assurance Society, 
1897 AC 647 at p. 655 (HL)] : (AC p. 655) “Of course 
a proviso may be used to guide you in the selection of 
one or other of two possible constructions of the words 
to be found in the enactment, and shew when there is 
doubt about its scope, when it may reasonably admit 

16 
of doubt as to its having this scope or that, which is 
the proper view to take of it;” [ Justice G.P. 
Singh, Principles of Statutory Interpretation (14th 
Edn., Lexis Nexis, 2016) p. 223.] 
 
92.4. An effort should be made while construing a statute to give 
meaning both to the main enactment and its proviso bearing in 
mind that sometimes a proviso is inserted as a matter of 
abundant caution: 
“The general rule in construing an enactment 
containing a proviso is to construe them together 
without making either of them redundant or otiose. 
Even if the enacting part is clear effort is to be made 
to give some meaning to the proviso and to justify its 
necessity. But a clause or a section worded as a 
proviso, may not be a true proviso and may have been 
placed by way of abundant caution.” [Id, p. 226.] 
 
92.5. While ordinarily, it would be unusual to interpret the proviso 
as an independent enacting clause, as distinct from its main 
enactment, this is true only of a real proviso and the draftsperson 
of the statute may have intended for the proviso to be, in 
substance, a fresh enactment: 
“… To read a proviso as providing something by way 
of an addendum or as dealing with a subject not 
covered by the main enactment or as stating a general 
rule as distinguished from an exception or qualification 
is ordinarily foreign to the proper function of a proviso. 
However, this is only true of a real proviso. The 
insertion of a proviso by the draftsman has not always 
strictly adhered to its legitimate use and at times a 
section worded as a proviso may wholly or partly be in 
substance a fresh enactment adding to and not merely 
excepting something out of or qualifying what goes 
before.” [Id, p. 228.] 
 
93. Perhaps the most comprehensive and oft-cited precedent 
governing the interpretation of a proviso is the decision of this 
Court in S. Sundaram Pillai v. V.R. Pattabiraman [S. Sundaram 
Pillai v. V.R. Pattabiraman, (1985) 1 SCC 591] . S. Murtaza Fazal 
Ali, J. speaking for a three-Judge Bench of this Court held : (SCC 
p. 610, para 43) 
“43. …To sum up, a proviso may serve four different 
purposes: 
(1) qualifying or excepting certain provisions from the 
main enactment; 
(2) it may entirely change the very concept of the 
intendment of the enactment by insisting on certain 

17 
mandatory conditions to be fulfilled in order to make 
the enactment workable; 
(3) it may be so embedded in the Act itself as to 
become an integral part of the enactment and thus 
acquire the tenor and colour of the substantive 
enactment itself; and 
(4) it may be used merely to act as an optional 
addenda to the enactment with the sole object of 
explaining the real intendment of the statutory 
provision.” 
 
94. While enunciating the above principles, S. Sundaram Pillai 
[S. Sundaram Pillai v. V.R. Pattabiraman, (1985) 1 SCC 591] 
took note of the decision in Hiralal Rattanlal v. State of U.P. 
[Hiralal Rattanlal v. State of U.P., (1973) 1 SCC 216 : 1973 SCC 
(Tax) 307] where K.S. Hegde, J., speaking for a four-Judge 
Bench of this Court observed that while ordinarily, a proviso is in 
the nature of an exception, the precedents indicate that 
sometimes a proviso is in the nature of a separate provision, with 
a life of its own. The Court held : (Hiralal Rattanlal case [Hiralal 
Rattanlal v. State of U.P., (1973) 1 SCC 216 : 1973 SCC (Tax) 
307] , SCC p. 224, para 22) 
 
“22. … Ordinarily a proviso to a section is intended to 
take out a part of the main section for special 
treatment. It is not expected to enlarge the scope of 
the main section. But cases have arisen in which this 
Court has held that despite the fact that a provision is 
called a proviso, it is really a separate provision and 
the so-called proviso has substantially altered the 
main section. In CIT v. Bipinchandra Maganlal & Co. 
Ltd. [CIT v. Bipinchandra Maganlal & Co. Ltd., AIR 
1961 SC 1040 : (1961) 2 SCR 493 : (1961) 41 ITR 
290] this Court held that by the fiction in Section 
10(2)(vii) second proviso read with Section 2(6-C) of 
the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 what is really not 
income is, for the purpose of computation of 
assessable income, made taxable income.” 
 
Besides the decision in CIT v. Bipinchandra Maganlal & Co. Ltd. 
[CIT v. Bipinchandra Maganlal & Co. Ltd., AIR 1961 SC 1040 : 
(1961) 2 SCR 493 : (1961) 41 ITR 290] , the Court in Hiralal 
Rattanlal [Hiralal Rattanlal v. State of U.P., (1973) 1 SCC 216 : 
1973 SCC (Tax) 307] adverted to the earlier decisions in State of 
Rajasthan v. Leela Jain [State of Rajasthan v. Leela Jain, AIR 
1965 SC 1296] and Bihta Coop. Development Cane Mktg. Union 
Ltd. v. Bank of Bihar [Bihta Coop. Development Cane Mktg. 
Union Ltd. v. Bank of Bihar, AIR 1967 SC 389] .” 
 

18 
Interpreting the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 4, on the principles 
noted above, we notice that the proviso has an important role to play and 
in the scheme of proceedings under section 4 of the Act of 1989, acts as 
a condition precedent. Therefore, the commission or omission of any of 
the duties by the public servant becomes a cognizable offence against the 
public servant only on the recommendation of the administrative enquiry, 
for in law, an offence means any act or omission made punishable by any 
law for the time being in force. A combined reading of sub-sections (1), 
(2) and (3) of section 4, would demonstrate that the commission or 
omission by a public servant has penal consequences and the willful 
neglect is recommended by an administrative enquiry and the cognizance 
can be taken thereafter. The recommendation of administrative enquiry 
on alleged failure of duty or function by a public servant would make the 
neglect of an offence clear and the cognizance of such an offence is legal. 
The competent court can take cognizance of the commission or omission 
of any duty specified under sub-section (2) of section 4 when made along 
with the recommendation and direct legal proceedings. Therefore, to 
constitute a prima facie case of negligence of duty, the proviso to sub-
section (2) of section 4 contemplates an administrative enquiry and 
recommendations.  
14. 
In law, an administrative enquiry presupposes an enquiry into the 
circumstances in which a public servant has a reason for not acting as 

19 
expected by the provisions of the Act or whether willfully neglected the 
duties assigned to the public servant by the Act of 1989.  
14.1 Sub-section (3) of section 4 enables the Special Court or Exclusive 
Special Court to take cognizance of the dereliction of a duty referred to in 
sub-section (2) of section 4 by a public servant. The reference to sub-
section (2) in sub-section (3) of section 4 would include the requirement 
in the proviso and the need for recommendation of an administrative 
enquiry as well. Alternatively, tapering the application of proviso to a later 
stage, viz., framing the charge, would defeat the very safeguard the 
proviso intends to accord to a public servant in the matter of registration 
of an FIR or facing criminal proceedings. The public servants are 
governed by conduct and discipline rules. The officers in charge of a 
police station are fastened with obligations, duties and functions in matters 
relating to crimes, prosecution, etc. The deviation of conduct is called 
misconduct by a public servant. Normally the word “misconduct”, among 
other contextual connotations, implies a wrongful intention and not a mere 
error of judgment. In service jurisprudence, the expression “misconduct” 
means wrong or improper misconduct, unlawful behaviour, misfeasance, 
wrong conduct, misdemeanor, etc. [See Baldev Singh Gandhi v. State 
of Punjab & Anr.8] Misconduct has not been defined in the Advocates 
Act, 1961. Misconduct, inter alia, envisages a breach of discipline, 
 
8 (2002) 3 SCC 667.  

20 
although it would not be possible to lay down exhaustively what would 
constitute misconduct and indiscipline, which, however, is wide enough to 
include wrongful omission or commission whether done or omitted to be 
done intentionally or unintentionally. It means, “improper behaviour, 
intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of a rule or standard of 
behaviour”. Misconduct is said to be a transgression of some established 
and definite rule of action, where no discretion is left except what 
necessity may demand; it is a violation of definite law [See Noratanmal 
Chouraria v. M.R. Murli & Anr.9]  
14.2 In the absence of section 4, the dereliction of duty by a public 
servant would have resulted in disciplinary proceedings and a punishment 
commensurate to the misconduct found against the public servant. Now 
for the same set of acts of commission or omission, section 4 makes them 
punishable and stipulates imprisonment of public servants for a term not 
less than six months which may extend to one year. The penal action can 
be set in motion by taking cognizance under section 4(3) of the Act of 
1989. Therefore, it is all the more reason that the requirement in the 
proviso to sub-section (2) of section 4 receives grammatical interpretation 
and makes a condition precedent for taking cognizance of an offence 
under section 4(2) of the Act of 1989.  
 
9 (2004) 5 SCC 689.  

21 
14.3 At this juncture, we refer to the decision in Bijender Singh v. State 
and Anr.10 of the High Court of Delhi, which considered a point nearer to 
the one considered by us in this judgment. We notice with approval the 
view expressed in Bijender Singh (supra) and the operative portion reads 
thus:  
“49. The argument of the learned counsel for the complainant is 
that the word “charges” occurring in proviso to Section 4(2) of the 
SC/ST Act is to be interpreted that the enquiry report is to be 
sought before framing of charges and not before the registration 
of the FIR. 
50. To my mind, the said argument is bereft of merit as the law 
laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Charansingh (supra) 
and as per the proviso noted above, the enquiry report is to be 
sought before the criminal proceedings are initiated and not 
before the framing of charges.” 
14.4 The absence of recommendation would bar taking cognizance by 
the Court. In a given case, if a complaint without recommendation is filed 
before the Magistrate, the Magistrate before proceeding further to keep 
his decision conforming to section 4(2) read with the proviso, calls for a 
report/recommendation from the Department against the named public 
servant. The Special Court or the Exclusive Special Court based on an 
administrative enquiry report can take cognizance of the alleged offence 
and thereon direct penal proceedings. By keeping in perspective, the 
language/scheme of section 4, and on the literal interpretation of sub-
 
10  (2024) 308 DLT 149. 

22 
sections (1), (2) and (3) of section 4, it would be legally permissible that 
the jurisdiction for infraction of sub-section (2) of section 4 is attracted only 
on the recommendation of the administrative enquiry and then, the 
cognizance under sub-section (3) of section 4 is ordered.  
15. 
By adhering to the above procedure, we hold that the Magistrate 
would have the accusation of a party and view of the Department while 
deciding to take cognizance of the offence or not. At the cost of repetition 
stated that, the purpose of an administrative enquiry is to find out the 
conduct of a public servant against whom allegations of failure of duty or 
function are made and the omission or commission is bonafide or willful. 
16. 
Let us juxtapose the statutory requirement with the chronology of 
events in the case on hand. On 05.06.2018, the Respondent moved the 
Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate for action against the named public 
servant under section 4 of the Act of 1989. The record does not disclose 
that the Magistrate called for an administrative enquiry report on the 
dereliction of duties complained against the named public servants. The 
material records that no case warranting penal proceedings under section 
4 has been made out and by the order dated 05.06.2018 the Metropolitan 
Magistrate dismissed C.T. No. 536/2018. In the above background, let us 
review the impugned judgment. As noted in paragraph 60 of the impugned 
judgment, the High Court of Delhi adjudicated the alleged omission or 
commission by the public servants, and a direction was issued for penal 

23 
action. Upon due consideration of the method and manner of taking 
cognizance of an offence against the public servant under section 4 of the 
Act of 1989, we note that the impugned judgment, for all purposes, 
adjudicated the alleged dereliction of duty by the named public servants 
and directed penal prosecution. These directions are not in conformity 
with the mandate of law. We are convinced that the direction in the 
impugned judgment for the above reasons and discussion is 
unsustainable, and accordingly, Point A is answered in favour of the 
Appellants. 
17. 
As adverted to in paragraph no. 11 (supra), the consideration of 
negligence in the performance of duty as a fact is not taken up for 
consideration by us in this judgment. Taking up the merits of the 
negligence of duty by the public servant would be without the 
recommendation of the administrative enquiry and is impermissible. The 
Metropolitan Magistrate, keeping in perspective the binding precedents 
under section 156(3) of the CrPC, applied his discretion to the 
circumstances of the case and concluded that no offence was made out 
in the complaint and application dated 29.04.2018 and 09.05.2018, 
respectively, and also in the complaint dated 25.05.2018 under section 4 
of the Act of 1989. In our considered view, the decision of the Metropolitan 
Magistrate is correct and unassailable in the circumstances of the case. 
Therefore, the impugned judgment, for the above reasons and 

24 
deliberation, is unsustainable and contrary to the proviso to section 4(2) 
of the Act of 1989. Hence, the impugned judgment is set aside and the 
Criminal Appeal is allowed.
