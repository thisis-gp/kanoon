THE CONTRACT 
2.   
OPG Power Generation Private Ltd (in short OPG -
the appellant in the leading appeal), a subsidiary of Gita 
Power and Infrastructure Private Limited (in short Gita 
Power – Respondent No.2 (R-2) in the leading appeal, and 
appellant in the connected appeal), floated a composite 
tender for design, manufacture, supply, erection and 
commissioning of air-cooled condenser unit (ACC Unit) 
with auxiliaries for 160 MW Coal Based Thermal Power 
Plant (Project) at Gummidipoondi in the State of Tamil 
Nadu.  Enexio Power Cooling Solutions (in short Enexio - 
Respondent No.1 (R-1) in the leading appeal) bid for the 
project. After a series of correspondences /negotiations, 
on 4 March 2013, R-2 issued two separate orders: (i) for 
design, engineering and supply of one ACC Unit with 
auxiliaries for 160 MW Coal Based Power Project at 
Gummidipoondi (in short, Supply Purchase Order); and (ii) 
for erection and commissioning of one unit of ACC with 
auxiliaries for 160 MW Coal Based Power Project at 
Gummidipoondi (in short, Erection Purchase Order). 
Interestingly, the tender was floated by OPG but the 
supply and erection orders were issued by its holding

company (Gita Power - R-2) on 4 March 2013. However, 
later, in the month of July 2013, OPG confirmed those 
orders by issuing two separate orders with same terms 
and bearing the same date i.e. 4 March 2013.  
 
3.      The supply / erection purchase orders with its 
enclosures contained an arbitration clause in the following 
terms:  
 
“Clause 21. ARBITRATION

THE DISPUTE BETWEEN PARTIES 
 
6.   
The intended completion/ commissioning date, as 
originally contemplated, was 31 March 2014. However, 
commissioning took place in May 2015.  The total amount 
billed by Enexio (R-1) for the aforesaid two orders was Rs. 
46,71,04,493 but the amount paid to it was Rs. 
39,59,19,629 only.  This gave rise to a dispute. According 
to Enexio (R-1), Rs.6,75,15,631 remained payable to it. 
Whereas, according to the appellant, nothing was due as 
from the remaining amount, following sums were 
deductible:

“(i) Rs.3,30,00,000, vide debit note dated

(iv) Rs. 27,40,161 towards ACC duct fabrication. 
Totaling Rs. 9,53,19,708.” 
 
7.   
 On 19 April 2018 a meeting took place between 
the representatives of the parties. Minutes of that meeting 
were drawn in the following terms:

The above figures are validated by respective

However, we request that the CD, CVD and LD’s 
be looked at leniently and mutually settled. The 
Contract calls for all taxes such as ED, ST to be 
reimbursed and CVD is equivalent to Excise 
duty. 
LD is not only due to our ENEXIO’s fault. In any 
case, this did not cause for any delay in Plant 
commissioning. We have had huge losses due to 
US dollar increase during Project stage to the 
tune of Rs.1.82 crores.  
ENEXIO requested that the above amount of 
Rs.2,78,04,090/- payable by them to M/s. OPG 
Power Generation Pvt. Ltd. be adjusted against 
the amount to be received by M/s. ENEXIO

8.   
According to Enexio (R-1), in that meeting, the 
parties were ad idem regarding the outstanding principal 
amount payable to Enexio (R-1) and there was no 
consensus on any other item mentioned in the minutes of 
the meeting. 
 
9.         On 26 May 2018 OPG extended an offer of Rs. 300 
lacs to Enexio (R-1) as full and final settlement of the 
account. This was not accepted by Enexio. Hence, the 
claim.

11. 
On 15 July 2019 OPG submitted its defense, and 
raised counterclaims in respect of: (a) liquidated damages 
for delay; (b) customs duties; (c) cost of erection of 
horizontal and vertical exhaust through external agency; 
(d) cost of repair/ replacement of gear boxes; and (e) cost 
of repair/ replacement of fan modules.  
 
THE AWARD 
 
12. 
On 13 July 2020 ICC Arbitral Tribunal, comprising 
of three members, delivered a unanimous award, 
whereunder OPG and Gita Power, who have separately 
filed these two appeals, were required to pay, jointly and 
severally, to the claimant (R-1 - Enexio): 
(i) Rs. 6,11,75,470/- towards outstanding 
principal amount due under the purchase 
orders; 
(ii) 
Rs. 
95,27,533/- 
towards 
ICC 
Administrative Costs and the Tribunal 
fees and expenses incurred in the 
arbitration; and 
(iii) Rs. 40,65,515/- towards claimant’s 
legal fees and expenses. 
     In addition to the above, OPG and Gita 
Power were directed to pay simple interest 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 9 of 150 
 
 
at a rate of 10% per annum on: (a) Rs. 
6,11,75,470/- from 30 October 2015 
until 
the 
date 
of 
payment; 
(b) 
Rs.95,27,533/- from the date of the 
award till the date of payment; and (c) Rs. 
40,65,515/- from the date of the award 
till the date of payment. 
 
However, all other claims including 
counterclaims were rejected. 
 
KEY FINDINGS IN THE AWARD 
 
13. 
The key findings of the Arbitral Tribunal were: 
 
(a) Gita Power and OPG are jointly and severally 
liable – Gita Power, being the holding company of OPG, 
had actively participated in the negotiations and had 
placed the purchase orders, which were later confirmed 
by OPG. In fact, they both acted as a single economic 
enterprise. Therefore, mere issuance of another set of 
purchase orders by OPG with same terms and 
conditions would not relieve Gita Power of its 
obligations, rather both would be jointly and severally 
liable to the claimant (Enexio). 
 
(b) Claimant is entitled to the unpaid principal 
amount with interest – Principal amount of Rs. 
6,75,15,631/- is due and payable to the claimant 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 10 of 150 
 
 
(Enexio) under the terms of the purchase orders, subject 
to reconciliation of Rs.63,40,161 spent on vertical duct 
erection. Thus, net amount payable to the claimant is 
Rs. 6,11,75,470 plus interest. 
 
(c) No Damages are payable by Enexio to OPG/ Gita 
Power for the delay – The claimant was entitled to 
extension up to the date of completion i.e., 21 
September 2015. Therefore, Enexio has no liability 
towards liquidated damages for the delay. Moreover, all 
the completion requirements were achieved by that 
date.  
 
(d) No liability of Enexio to pay customs duty – 
Clause 6 of the Supply / Erection Purchase orders 
stipulated that all taxes, duties and local levies payable 
would be borne and paid by the purchaser. Therefore, 
liability to pay customs duty would fall upon the 
purchaser/ employer. 
(e) Limitation -  
(i) Declaratory relief sought by Enexio qua the 
debit notes (i.e., towards liquidated damages and 
customs duty) is beyond the period of limitation 
prescribed by Article 58 of the Limitation Act, 19634;  
 
4 1963 Act 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 11 of 150 
 
 
(ii) However, Enexio’s claim for unpaid dues 
payable under the contract is within the period of 
limitation; and 
(iii) 
OPG’s 
counterclaim 
for 
cost 
of 
repair/replacement of gearboxes and fan modules is 
barred by limitation.  
 
Reasoning of the Arbitral Tribunal on limitation: 
 
14. 
Regarding the finding on limitation, the Arbitral 
Tribunal (in short the “Tribunal”) observed that the 
declaratory relief qua the debit notes (i.e., towards: (a) 
Liquidated damages for the delay; and (b) Customs duty) 
was sought beyond three years from the date when the 
right to sue first accrued, therefore it was beyond the 
limitation period prescribed by Article 58 of the Schedule 
to the 1963 Act. The Tribunal noticed that the debit note 
for liquidated damages was issued on 24 August 2015; the 
claimant acknowledged its receipt vide letter dated 28 
August 2015; whereas the request for arbitration was 
received by ICC Secretariat on 2 May 2019.  Likewise, the 
debit note for customs duty was issued on 12 January 
2016 that is, beyond three years from the date of request 
for arbitration. 
 
15. 
Insofar as the relief for recovery of the unpaid 
amount under the purchase orders was concerned, the 
Tribunal opined that it was not barred by limitation 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 12 of 150 
 
 
because meaningful negotiations were ongoing between 
the parties as evidenced by the minutes of meeting dated 
19 April 2018, which was followed by a written offer of the 
purchaser/ employer, dated 26 May 2018, to pay Rupees 
three crores to the claimant as full and final settlement of 
the account. The relevant observations in that regard are 
found in paragraph 16.03 (d) of the award, which is 
extracted below: 
“16.03 (d) Based on the arguments of the Parties’ 
respective Counsel and with reference to the case 
law and statutes cited during the oral hearing in 
this arbitration, the Tribunal finds that as long 
as 
meaningful 
negotiations 
were 
ongoing 
between the parties the period of limitation of 
three years had not begun to run. Following the 
meeting held between the parties on 19th April 
2018 the respondents made a written offer to 
settle the matter on 26th May 2018. Thus, the 
Tribunal finds that the period of limitation had 
not commenced until 26th May 2018 and 
consequently had not expired when the Request 
for Arbitration was received by the ICC 
Secretariat on 2nd May 2019. Accordingly, the 
Tribunal finds that items A, D, E and F claiming 
payment of money are not time barred.” 
 
16. 
Regarding the counterclaim for cost of repair/ 
replacement of gearboxes and fan modules as barred by 
limitation, the Tribunal reasoned thus: 
“16.04 Time Bar in relation to the Respondents’ 
counterclaims for the cost of repair/replacement 
of gearboxes and fan modules. 
There is no evidence that these counterclaims 
were included in the ongoing negotiations. The 
Tribunal has found that the Taking Over 
Certificate is deemed to have been issued on 21st 
September 2015. (See Section 13.13 above). On 
that date the Claimant is deemed to have 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 13 of 150 
 
 
completed its obligations and thus, that is the 
latest date from which the limitation period of 
three years must run. The Claimant’s liabilities 
are barred by limitation on or earlier than 21st 
September 
2018. 
The 
Counterclaim 
was 
delivered on 15th July 2019 and is, thus, barred 
by limitation……….” 
 
CHALLENGE TO THE AWARD U/S 34 OF THE 1996 
ACT 
 
17. 
Two applications, namely, O.P. Nos. 533 and 562 
of 2020, were filed by OPG (the appellant in the leading 
Civil Appeal) and Gita Power (appellant in the connected 
appeal and R-2 in the leading appeal) respectively, under 
Section 34 of the 1996 Act, for setting aside the award 
dated 13 July 2020.   
 
Grounds of Challenge 
 
18. 
OPG and Gita Power laid challenge to the arbitral 
award, inter alia, on the following grounds:   
(i) 
Enexio’s (R-1’s) claim was made beyond the 
period of limitation prescribed by Articles 14 and 
18 of the Schedule to the 1963 Act. The 
arbitration clause was invoked on 2 May 2019, 
well beyond three years from the date (i.e., 31 
March 2014) when the work ought to have been 
completed as per the contract. It was also beyond 
three years from the deemed date of completion 
(i.e., 21 September 2015).  

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 14 of 150 
 
 
(ii) Different yardstick was adopted in computing the 
limitation period of the claim than what was 
adopted for the counterclaim, which was not at all 
justified as both arose out of same contractual 
relationship.  
(iii) One part of the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 
2018 that supported the counterclaim was 
discarded, while the other part, which favored the 
claimant, was accepted. This is nothing but 
perverse. 
(iv) The time for completion of the work under the 
contract was extended without any basis.   
(v) Findings in the award are self-contradictory in as 
much as, if challenge to the debit note for 
damages on account of the delay was beyond 
limitation, there was no logic in denying 
adjustment of those damages against the unpaid 
dues payable to Enexio under the purchase 
orders.     
(vi) Material evidence qua liability for customs duty 
was ignored.

After charting the relevant dates, and perusing the 
arbitral award, in paragraph 25 of the judgment, the 
learned Single Judge observed:  
 
“25. There is a clear dichotomy in impugned 
award regarding the legal drill of testing 
limitation. AT has taken 26.05.2018 as the 
reckoning date, that being the date on which 
written offer to settle the matter was made by 
Gita/OPG vide Ex. C. 79, but for testing the 
counter claim of Gita/OPG, AT has taken

Page 16 of 150 
 
 
21.09.2015 as the reckoning date or starting 
point of limitation, that being the date of deemed 
completion 
of 
said 
work. 
This 
Court 
is 
constrained to observe that this dichotomy is 
akin to classical division between science and 
mysticism. Therefore, this Court unhesitatingly 
holds that this is patently illegal and an 
implausible view. To be noted, this dichotomy is 
not a mere erroneous application of law, and it 
needs no reappreciation of evidence. It is also an 
infract of section 18 of A and C Act which 
provides for equal treatment of parties. More 
importantly, the law of limitation being based on 
public policy, as already delineated supra, 
infract of the same would clearly vitiate the 
impugned award as one being in conflict with 
public policy of India.”  
 
 
21. 
The learned Single Judge thereafter proceeded to 
observe that the counterclaim and heads of claim were so 
intertwined with each other that a decision on one, with 
no decision on the other, would vitiate the entire award. 
Further, it was observed, if the arbitral tribunal had taken 
the date of joint meeting (i.e., 19 April 2018), and the 
follow up offer dated 26 May 2018, as the starting point of 
limitation for the claim, the same would be the starting 
point of limitation for the counterclaim as well.  And if the 
starting point of limitation is taken as 21 September 2015 
(i.e., the date of completion of the work), the claim, which 
was filed on 2 May 2019, was well beyond three years and 
as such barred by limitation. Thus, according to the 
learned Single Judge there was inherent contradiction in 
the arbitral award which made it vulnerable to a challenge 
under Section 34 of the 1996 Act. Consequently, the 
learned Single Judge set aside the arbitral award.

Aggrieved by the judgment and order of the learned 
Single Judge, dated 23 December 2020, Enexio (R-1 
herein) filed two appeals, namely, O.S.A. (CAD) Nos. 174 
and 175 of 2021, before the Division Bench of the High 
Court, which came to be allowed by the impugned 
judgment. 
 
IMPUGNED JUDGMENT 
 
23. 
 The Division Bench of the High Court, inter alia, 
took the view that the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 
2018, read with e-mail dated 26 May 2018, amounted to 
an acknowledgment of the dues payable to Enexio, thereby 
satisfying the ingredients of Section 18 of the 1963 Act for 
a fresh period of limitation to run from that date. It 
observed that when the last part of the minutes’ dated 19 
April 2018 is read with subsequent communication dated 
26 May 2018, it belies the stand of the counterclaimant 
that the counterclaims were admitted to the claimant. 
Thus, the Division Bench, inter alia, held that the view 
taken by the arbitral tribunal was a possible view and 
there was no patent illegality in the award meriting 
interference under Section 34 of the 1996 Act.  
Consequently, the order of the learned Single Judge was 
set aside, and the arbitral award was restored.

We have heard Mr. Abhimanyu Bhandari for the 
appellants; Mr. Gaurab Banerjee for the claimant-
respondent and have perused the record. 
 
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT(S) 
 
25. 
The learned counsel for the appellants, inter alia, 
submitted:  
 
(i) 
The Arbitral Tribunal, in paragraph 16.03(d) of 
the award qua claims (i), (iv), (v) and (vi) 
(corresponding claim numbers A, D, E and F) of 
the claimant-respondent, observed:  
“As long as meaningful negotiations were ongoing 
between the parties, the period of limitation of three 
years had not begun to run. Following the meeting 
held between the parties on 19th April, 2018 the 
respondents made a written offer to settle the matter 
on 26 May 2018. Thus, the Tribunal finds that the 
period of limitation had not commenced until 26 May 
2018 and consequently had not expired when the 
request for arbitration was received by the ICC 
Secretariat on 2 May 2019.”  
 
The afore-quoted observations are in teeth of 
decisions of this Court in (i) Bharat Sanchar 
Nigam Limited v. Nortel Networks Pvt. Ltd.5 
and (ii) B & T AG v. Ministry of Defence6 where 
it has been held that mere negotiations will not 
postpone the cause of action for the purpose of 
limitation.

Page 19 of 150 
 
 
 
(ii) The period of limitation for the claim would have 
to be counted as three years from the date of 
completion i.e., 21 September 2015, which got 
over before 2 May 2019 i.e., the date when request 
was received for arbitration. Once the claim is 
barred by limitation, the award allowing the claim 
would be deemed to be violative of fundamental 
policy of Indian law and, therefore, vulnerable in 
the light of the law declared in (i) Ssangyong 
Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI7 and (ii) 
Associate Builders v. Delhi Development 
Authority.8   
 
(iii) The Arbitral Tribunal applied different yardstick 
for computing limitation of the claim than what 
was adopted for the counterclaim. For example, 
the start point of limitation for the claim was 
taken as 26 May 2018 whereas for the 
counterclaim it was taken as 21 September 2015. 
This amounted to unequal treatment of the 
parties 
more so 
when claim as 
well as 
counterclaim arose from the same contractual 
relationship.

Page 20 of 150 
 
 
(iv) Once the declaratory relief qua Debit Notes dated 
24 August 2015 (i.e. in respect of Rs. 3,30,00,000 
towards liquidated damages for the delay in 
supply and erection under the purchase orders) 
and 12 January 2016 (i.e. in respect of Rs. 
5,94,06,693/- towards Customs Duties) was held 
barred by limitation, the amount reflected in the 
Debit Notes ought to have been deemed payable 
by the claimant and that amount ought to have 
been adjusted against any amount payable to the 
claimant.  
 
(v) The Division Bench erroneously relied on the 
minutes dated 19 April 2018 to apply Section 18 
of the 1963 Act for extending the period of 
limitation of the claim when it was nobody’s case 
that limitation stood extended thereby. Further, if 
the minutes dated 19 April 2018 were to be relied, 
it ought to have been relied in toto and not in part. 
That is, it should have been taken as an 
admission of liability of the claimant towards 
liquidated damages for the delay as well as 
customs duty. 
 
(vi) In paragraph 13 of the impugned judgment, the 
Division Bench sought to appreciate the evidence 
i.e. the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018, 
which was beyond the scope of powers exercisable

under Section 37 read with Section 34 of the 1996 
Act. In this regard, reliance was placed on: (i) UHL 
Power Company limited v. State of Himachal 
Pradesh9; (ii) Dyna Technologies Pvt. Ltd. v. 
Crompton Greaves Lt.,10; (iii) Heidelbergh 
Cement India Ltd. v. The Indure Pvt. Ltd.11; (iv) 
MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd.12; (v) Ssangyong 
Engg (supra); and (vi) Haryana Tourism Ltd. v. 
Kandhari Beverages Ltd.13 
 
(vii) The learned Single Judge justifiably set aside the 
award that was self-contradictory and perverse. 
  
(viii) Counterclaims for cost of repair/ replacement of 
gear boxes, which were defective, ought to have 
been adjudicated. In absence thereof, the arbitral 
award is rendered bad in law. 
 
(ix) The 
Division 
Bench 
of 
the 
High 
Court 
misconstrued the ratio of the decision of this 
Court in Geo Miller & Co. (P) Ltd. v. Rajasthan 
Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd14 for treating the 
claim within, and the counterclaim beyond, the 
period of limitation.

(x) The subsequent purchase orders issued by OPG 
replaced the earlier purchase orders issued by 
Gita Power, and the supply/ work was in respect 
of an OPG project, therefore Gita Power could not 
have been dragged into arbitration and made 
jointly and severally liable with OPG.    
 
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF FIRST RESPONDENT 
/ENEXIO 
 
26. 
The learned counsel for the first respondent, inter 
alia, submitted: 
(i) 
The findings in the award are factually 
correct. There is no patent illegality, as 
alleged, or otherwise, which may warrant 
interference under Section 34 of the 1996 
Act. Therefore, the Division Bench of the 
High Court was justified in setting aside 
the order of the Single Judge and restoring 
the award.  
 
(ii) 
 The appellant’s case that all counterclaims 
were treated as barred by limitation and, 
therefore, not considered on merits, is 
factually incorrect. In all five counterclaims 
were there. Out of those five, counterclaims 
towards: (i) liquidated damages for the 
delay in supply and erection; (ii) customs 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 23 of 150 
 
 
duty; and (iii) cost of erection of horizontal 
and vertical exhaust duct through an 
external agency, were considered and 
decided on merits. The counterclaims for 
liquidated damages and customs duty were 
rejected whereas counterclaim for cost of 
erection of vertical duct was allowed. Only 
two counterclaims towards (i) cost of 
repair/ replacement of Gear Boxes, due to 
alleged defective supply, amounting to 
Rs.9,76,000, and (ii) cost of repair/ 
replacement of Fan Modules, due to alleged 
defective 
supply, 
amounting 
to 
Rs.14,80,802, were dismissed as barred by 
limitation. The finding that these two 
counterclaims were barred by limitation is 
premised on there being no material to 
indicate that they were included in the 
ongoing negotiation. 
 
(iii)  The arbitral tribunal considered the three 
counterclaims on merit by adopting the 
same yardstick qua limitation as applied to 
the claims. These three counterclaims were 
not treated as barred by limitation as they 
were cited in the minutes of the meeting 
dated 19 April 2018 wherein the principal 
amount 
due 
to 
OPG 
was 
also 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 24 of 150 
 
 
acknowledged.  It is thus incorrect to state 
that the arbitral tribunal adopted different 
yardstick on the point of limitation while 
deciding counterclaims than what was 
adopted to decide the claims. 
 
(iv) 
Enexio’s claim of the balance amount was 
not barred by limitation even if the 
limitation period is counted from the date 
of completion of the project i.e., 21 
September 2015, because before expiry of 
the period of limitation of three years, that 
is before 20 September 2018, vide minutes 
of the meeting dated 19 April 2018, OPG 
had acknowledged in writing its liability 
towards the balance of the principal 
amount 
(i.e., 
Rs. 
6,75,15,631) albeit 
subject to deductions. Thus, by virtue of 
Section 18 of the 1963 Act, from the date 
of written acknowledgment, which was 
followed by written communication dated 
26 May 2018, fresh period of limitation of 
three years began to run.  
 
(v) 
Inference drawn from the minutes of the 
meeting as well as subsequent conduct of 
the parties to conclude lack of consent on 
Enexio’s part for deductions in the 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 25 of 150 
 
 
outstanding amount, is a decision within 
the remit of the arbitral tribunal. Therefore, 
any error, if at all, would be an error within 
its jurisdiction, which is not amenable to 
interference under Section 34 of the 1996 
Act. Because, while examining the validity 
of an award under Section 34, the Court 
exercises supervisory and not appellate 
jurisdiction (vide: (i) Steel Authority of 
India Ltd. versus Gupta Brothers Steel 
Tubes Ltd.15; (ii) Associated Builders 
(supra); (iii) Ssangyong Engg (supra); and 
(iv) Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd. 
v. DMRC Ltd.16).  
 
(vi) 
The learned Single Judge had erred in 
observing: 
(a) ‘That any infract qua limitation 
would violate public policy and attract 
Section 34 (2) (b) (ii) read with 
Explanation 1 of the 1996 Act.’ 
Because 
limitation 
is 
a 
mixed 
question of fact and law and if its 
determination 
depends 
on 
interpretation 
/ 
appreciation 
of 
evidence / materials on record, any

Page 26 of 150 
 
 
error, ipso facto, would not render the 
award amenable to interference as is 
clear from the Proviso to sub-section 
(2-A) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act. 
 
(b) ‘That different dates could not have 
been taken for determining limitation 
of the claim and the counterclaim, 
when both were intertwined and had 
arisen from a common supply/works 
contract.’  Because three out of five 
counterclaims were decided on merits 
and not on limitation. The remaining 
two were rejected on limitation as 
they were not reflected in the minutes 
of meeting dated 19 April 2018. 
Therefore, benefit of Section 18 of the 
1963 Act was not available qua those 
counterclaims. 
Moreover, 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
general 
rule 
that 
limitation 
for 
claims 
and 
counterclaims must have a common 
run 
because 
counterclaim 
is 
a 
separate action which must stand on 
its own legs, as has been held by this 
Court in Oil and Natural Gas

(vii) The counterclaim for the cost of repair/ 
replacement of gearboxes and fan modules 
was rightly rejected by the arbitral tribunal 
as barred by limitation as regarding it there 
was no recital in the minutes of meeting 
dated 19 April 2018. Moreover, it was not 
intertwined with the claim for the balance 
amount as the cause of action for the two 
were different. One arose from supply and 
erection, and the other arose subsequently, 
post commissioning/ completion of the 
project, on account of alleged defect in the 
material supplied.

OPG and having actively participated in the 
formation of the contract as also in 
issuance of purchase orders for the 
supply/ 
works, 
which 
carried 
the 
arbitration clause, was bound by the 
arbitration agreement and also liable 
jointly and severally along with OPG for the 
dues.

ISSUES 
 
27. 
Upon consideration of the rival submissions, the 
core issue which falls for our determination is: 
 
“Whether the arbitral award is in conflict with 
the public policy of India, or/ and is vitiated 
by patent illegality appearing on the face of 
the award?” 
 
28. 
The answer to the above issue would depend, inter 
alia, on our determination of the following sub-issues: 
 
(a) Whether Gita Power (R-2) could have 
been subjected to arbitration and made 
jointly and severally liable along with 
OPG for the award, when the project 
beneficiary was OPG?    
 
(b) Whether 
Enexio’s 
claim 
for 
the 
outstanding principal amount barred 
by limitation? 
  
(c) Whether the counter claim, in respect 
of cost of repair / replacement of gear 
boxes and fan modules, could be 
treated as barred by time when the 
other side’s claim, arising out of same 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 29 of 150 
 
 
contractual relationship, was found 
within limitation?    
 
(d) Whether arbitral award for payment of 
the outstanding principal amount with 
interest is perverse because it makes 
no adjustment for debit note(s) entries 
even though the prayer to declare them 
as invalid was rejected as barred by 
time?  
 
(e)  Whether the reasoning of the arbitral 
tribunal is flawed and vitiated by 
adopting 
different 
yardstick 
for 
adjudging the counterclaim than what 
was adopted for adjudging the claim? If 
so, whether it vitiated the award and 
rendered it vulnerable to a challenge 
under Section 34 of the 1996 Act? 
   
 
RELEVANT 
LEGAL 
PRINCIPLES 
GOVERNING 
A 
CHALLENGE TO AN ARBITRAL AWARD 
 
29. 
Before we delve into the issue/ sub-issues culled 
out above, it would be useful to have a look at the relevant 
legal principles governing a challenge to an arbitral award. 
Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be 
made through an application for setting aside such award 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021

in accordance with sub-sections (2), (2-A) and (3) of 
Section 34 of the 1996 Act18.  Sub-section (2) of Section 34 
has two clauses, (a) and (b). Clause (a) has five sub-
clauses which are not relevant to the issues raised before 
 
18 Section 34. Application for setting aside arbitral award. --- (1) ……….. 
 
(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if--- 
 
 
(a) the party making the application establishes on the basis of the record of the arbitral 
tribunal that--- 
(i) a party was under some incapacity; or 
(ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it 
or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or 
(iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an 
arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or 
(iv) the arbitral award deals with the dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the 
terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the 
submission to arbitration: 
Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so 
submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to 
arbitration may be set aside; or 
(v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance 
with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with the provision of this 
Part from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with 
this Part; or 
 
 
(b) the Court finds that – 
 
 
 
(i) the subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration 
under the law for the time being in force, or 
 
 
 
(ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India. 
 
 
Explanation 1. — For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict 
with the public policy of India, only if, – 
(i) 
the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in 
violation of section 75 or section 81; or 
(ii) 
it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law; or 
(iii) 
it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice. 
Explanation 2--- For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention 
with the fundamental policy of Indian law, shall not entail a review on the merits of the 
dispute. 
 
(2A) An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations, 
may also be set aside by the Court, if the Court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on 
the face of the award: 
 
Provided that an award shall not be set aside, merely on the ground of an erroneous application of 
the law or by reappreciation of evidence. 
 
(3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date 
on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made 
under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal: 
 
Provided that if the court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making 
the application within the set period of three months it may entertain the application within a period of 30 
days, but not thereafter.

us. Insofar as clause (b) is concerned, it has two sub-
clauses, namely, (i) and (ii). Sub-clause (i) of clause (b) is 
not relevant to the controversy in hand. Sub-clause (ii) of 
clause (b) provides that if the Court finds that the arbitral 
award is in conflict with the public policy of India, it may 
set aside the award.  
 
Public Policy 
 
30. 
“Public policy” is a concept not statutorily defined, 
though it has been used in statutes, rules, notification etc. 
since long, and is also a part of common law.   Section 2319 
of the Contract Act, 1872 uses the expression by stating 
that the consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, 
unless, inter alia, opposed to public policy. That is, a 
contract which is opposed to public policy is void. 
 
31. 
In Chitty on Contracts20, scope of public policy, 
largely accepted across jurisdictions for invalidation of 
contracts, has been summarized in the following terms: 
 
“Objects which on grounds of public policy 
invalidate contracts may, for convenience, be 
generally classified into five groups: first, objects 
 
19 Section 23.-- What consideration and objects are lawful, and what not. -- The consideration or object of an 
agreement is lawful, unless –  
it is forbidden by law; or  
is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law; or is fraudulent; or  
involves or implies, injury to the person or property of another; or 
the court regards it as immoral, or opposed to public policy. 
In each of these cases, the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. Every agreement of 
which the object or consideration is unlawful is wide.

which are illegal by common law or by 
legislation; secondly, objects injurious to good 
government either in the field of domestic or 
foreign affairs; thirdly, objects which interfere 
with the proper working of the machinery of 
justice; fourthly, objects injurious to marriage

In Gherulal Parakh v. Mahadeodas Maiya and 
others21, a three-Judge Bench of this Court, in the context 
of Section 23 of the Contract Act, summarized the doctrine 
of public policy as follows: 
 
“Public policy or the policy of the law is an elusive 
concept; it has been described as untrustworthy 
guide, variable quality, uncertain one, unruly 
horse, etc; the primary duty of a court of law is 
to enforce a promise which the parties have 
made and to uphold the sanctity of contracts 
which formed the basis of society, but in certain 
cases, the court may relieve them of their duty 
on a rule founded on what is called the public 
policy; for want of better words Lord Atkin 
describes that something done contrary to public 
policy is a harmful thing, but the doctrine is 
extended not only to harmful cases but also to 
harmful tendencies; this doctrine of public policy 
is only a branch of common law, and, just like 
any other branch of common law, it is governed 
by 
precedents; 
the 
principles 
have 
been 
crystallized under different heads and though it 
is permissible for courts to expound and apply 
them to different situations, it should only be 
invoked in clear and incontestable cases of harm 
to the public; Though the heads are not closed 
and though theoretically it may be permissible to 
evolve 
a 
new 
head 
under 
exceptional 
circumstances of a changing world, it is 
advisable in the interest of stability of society not

to make any attempt to discover new heads in 
these days.

33. 
In Central Inland Water Transport Corporation 
v. Brojo Nath Ganguly22, this Court observed that the 
expressions ‘public policy’, ‘opposed to public policy’, or 
‘contrary to public policy’ are incapable of precise 
definition. It was observed that public policy is not the 
policy of a particular government. Rather it connotes some 
matter which concerns the public good and the public 
interest. It was observed: 
“92.……what is for the public good or in the 
public interest or what would be injurious or 
harmful to the public good or the public interest 
has varied from time to time. As new concepts 
take the place of old, transactions which were 
once considered against public policy are now 
being upheld by the courts and, similarly, where 
there has been a well- recognized head of public 
policy, the courts have not shirked from 
extending it to new transactions and changed 
circumstances and have at times not even 
flinched from inventing a new head of public 
policy.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
  
34. 
In Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric 
Co.23, a three-Judge Bench of this Court observed that the 
doctrine of public policy is somewhat open- textured and 
flexible. By citing earlier decisions, it was observed that 
there are two conflicting positions which are referred to as 
the “narrow view” and the “broad view”.  According to the 
 
22 (1986) 3 SCC 156, paragraph 92 
23 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 34 of 150 
 
 
narrow view, courts cannot create new heads of public 
policy whereas the broad view countenances judicial law 
making in these areas. In the field of private international 
law, it was pointed out, courts refuse to apply a rule of 
foreign law or recognize a foreign judgment or a foreign 
arbitral award if it is found that the same is contrary to 
the public policy of the country in which it is sought to be 
invoked or enforced. However, it was clarified, a 
distinction is to be drawn while applying the rule of public 
policy between a matter governed by domestic law and a 
matter involving conflict of laws. It was observed that the 
application of the doctrine of public policy in the field of 
conflict of laws is more limited than that in the domestic 
law and the courts are slower to invoke public policy in 
cases involving a foreign element than when a purely 
municipal legal issue is involved. It was held that 
contravention of law alone will not attract the bar of public 
policy, and something more than contravention of law is 
required. 
 
35. 
In fact, in Renusagar (supra), this Court was 
dealing with the enforceability of a foreign award. For that 
end, it had to interpret the expression “contrary to public 
policy” in the context of Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of Foreign 
Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 196124.  While 
 
24 Section 7. Conditions for enforcement of foreign awards. – (1) A foreign award may be enforced under this 
Act— 
 
 
******* 
 
(b) if the court dealing with the case is satisfied that – 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 35 of 150 
 
 
doing so, this Court held that -- (a) contravention of law 
alone will not attract the bar of public policy, and 
something more than contravention of law is required25; 
and (b) the expression ‘public policy’ must be construed in 
the sense the doctrine of public policy is applied in the 
field of private international law. Applying the said criteria, 
it was held that enforcement of a foreign award could be 
refused on the ground of being contrary to public policy if 
such enforcement would be contrary to (a) fundamental 
policy of Indian law or (b) the interests of India or (c) justice 
or morality26. The Court thereafter proceeded to hold that 
a contravention of the provisions of the Foreign Exchange 
Regulation Act would be contrary to the public policy of 
India as that statute is enacted for the national economic 
interest to ensure that the nation does not lose foreign 
exchange which is essential for the economic survival of 
the nation27.  
   
36. 
What is clear from above is that for an award to be 
against public policy of India a mere infraction of the 
municipal laws of India is not enough. There must be, inter 
alia, infraction of fundamental policy of Indian law 
including a law meant to serve public interest or public 
good.

(ii) the enforcement of the award will be contrary to the public policy.

In Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) v. 
Saw Pipes Ltd.28 a two-Judge Bench of this Court, in the 
context of a challenge to a domestic arbitral award under 
Section 34(2)(b)(ii) of the 1996 Act as it stood prior to 2015 
amendment, ascribed wider meaning to the expression 
‘public policy of India’ in the following terms: 
 
“31.  ……. the phrase public policy of India used 
in section 34 in context is required to be given a 
wider meaning. It can be stated that the concept 
of public policy connotes some matter which 
concerns public good and the public interest. 
What is for public good or in public interest or 
what would be injurious or harmful to the public 
good or public interest has varied from time to 
time. However, the award which is, on the face of 
it, patently in violation of statutory provisions 
cannot be said to be in public interest. Such 
award/ judgment/ decision is likely to adversely 
affect the administration of justice. Hence, in our 
view, in addition to narrower meaning given to 
the term “public policy” in Renusagar case, it is 
required to be held that the award could be set 
aside if it is patently illegal. The result would be 
– award could be set aside if it is contrary to:  
(a) 
fundamental policy of Indian law; or  
(b) 
 the interest of India; or  
(c) 
 justice or morality, or  
(d) 
 in addition, if it is patently illegal. 
Illegality must go to the root of the matter and if 
the illegality is of trivial nature, it cannot be held 
that award is against the public policy. Award 
could also be set aside if it is so unfair and 
unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of 
the court. Such award is opposed to public policy 
and is required to be adjudged void.

Following the expansive view of the concept 
“contrary to public policy”, in D.D.A v. M/s. R.S. Sharma 
& Co.29, which related to a matter arising from a 
proceeding under Section 34, as it stood prior to 2015 
amendment, a two-Judge Bench of this Court, on the 
scope of the power to set aside an arbitral award, 
summarized the general principles as follows:  
“21. … 
(a) An award, which is 
(i) contrary to substantive provisions of 
law; or 
(ii) the provisions of the arbitration and 
Conciliation Act, 1996; or 
(iii) against the terms of the respective 
contract; or 
(iv) patently illegal; or 
(v) prejudicial to the rights of the parties; 
Is open to interference by the court 
under Section 34(2) of the Act. 
(b) The award could be set aside if it is contrary 
to: 
(a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or 
 
(b) the interest of India; or 
 
(c) justice or morality. 
(c) The award could also be set aside if it is so 
unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the 
conscience of the court. 
(d) It is open to the court to consider whether 
the award is against the specific terms of 
contract and if so, interfere with it on the 
ground that it is patently illegal and opposed 
to public policy of India.”

related to the period prior to 2015 amendment of Section 
34 (2)(b)(ii)31, a three-Judge Bench of this Court, after 
considering the decision in Saw Pipes (supra), without 
exhaustively enumerating the purport of the expression 
‘fundamental policy of Indian law’, observed that it would 
include all such fundamental principles as providing a 
basis for administration of justice and enforcement of law 
in this country.  The Court thereafter illustratively referred 
to three fundamental juristic principles, namely, (a) that 
in every determination that affects the rights of a citizen 
or leads to any civil consequences, the court or authority 
or quasi-judicial body must adopt a judicial approach, 
that is, it must act bona fide and deal with the subject in 
a fair, reasonable and objective manner and not actuated 
by 
any 
extraneous 
consideration; 
(b) 
that 
while 
determining the rights and obligations of parties the court 
or tribunal or authority must act in accordance with the 
principles of natural justice and must apply its mind to 
the attendant facts and circumstances while taking a view 
one way or the other; and (c) that its decision must not be 
perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would 
have arrived at the same.  
 
40. 
In Associate Builders (supra), a two-Judge Bench 
of this Court, held32 that audi alteram partem principle is

undoubtedly a fundamental juristic principle in Indian law 
and is enshrined in Sections 1833 and 34 (2)(a)(iii)34 of the 
1996 Act.  In addition to the earlier recognized principles 
forming fundamental policy of Indian law, it was held that 
disregarding: (a) orders of superior courts in India; and (b) 
the binding effect of the judgment of a superior court 
would also be regarded as being contrary to the 
fundamental policy of Indian law35.  Further, elaborating 
upon the third juristic principle (i.e., qua perversity), as 
laid down in Western Geco (supra), it was observed that 
where: (i) a finding is based on no evidence; or (ii) an 
arbitral tribunal takes into account something irrelevant 
to the decision which it arrives at; or (iii) ignores vital 
evidence in arriving at its decision, such decision would 
necessarily be perverse36. To this a caveat was added by 
observing that when a court applies the ‘public policy test’ 
to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court of appeal 
and, consequently, errors of fact cannot be corrected; and 
a possible view by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily 
to pass muster as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of 
the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied upon 
when he delivers his arbitral award. It was also observed 
that an award based on little evidence or on evidence 
which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal

mind would not be held to be invalid on that score. Thus, 
once it is found that the arbitrator’s approach is not 
arbitrary or capricious, it is to be taken as the last word 
on facts37. 
 
2015 Amendment in Sections 34 and 48  
 
41. 
The afore-mentioned judicial pronouncements 
were all prior to 2015 Amendment. Notably, prior to the 
Amendment, 2015 the expression “in contravention with 
the fundamental policy of Indian law” was not used by the 
legislature in either Section 34(2)(b)(ii) or Section 48(2)(b).  
The pre-amended Section 34(2)(b)(ii) and its Explanation 
read: 
“S.34. Application for setting aside arbitral 
award— 
(1) ******* 
(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the court 
only if— 
****** 
(b) the court finds that – 
****** 
(ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public 
policy of India. 
Explanation.-- Without prejudice to the generality of 
sub-clause (ii) it is hereby declared, for the avoidance 
of any doubt, that an award is in conflict with the 
public policy of India if the making of the award was 
induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in 
violation of section 75 or section 81. 
 
Whereas 
pre-amended 
Section 
48(2)(b) 
and 
its 
Explanation read:

(2) Enforcement of an arbitral award may also be

(b) the enforcement of the award would be contrary 
to the public policy of India.  
Explanation. – Without prejudice to the generality of 
sub-clause (b) of this section, it is hereby declared, 
for the avoidance of any doubt, that an award is in 
conflict with the public policy of India if the making 
of the award was induced or affected by fraud or 
corruption. 
  
 
 
 
42. 
By the Amendment, 2015, in place of the old 
Explanation to Section 34(2)(b)(ii), Explanations 1 and 2 
were added to remove any doubt as to when an arbitral 
award is in conflict with the public policy of India.   
 
43. 
At this stage, it would be pertinent to note that we 
are dealing with a case where the application under 
Section 34 of the 1996 Act was filed after the Amendment, 
2015, 
therefore 
the 
newly 
substituted/ 
added 
Explanations would apply38.   
 
44. 
The Amendment, 2015 adds two explanations to 
each of the two sections, namely, Section 34(2)(b)(ii)39 and 
Section 48(2)(b)40, in place of the earlier Explanation.  The 
 
38 Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd (supra)  
39 See footnote 18 
40 Section 48(2)(b).-- 
Explanation 1. — For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict with the 
public policy of India, only if ,-- 
(i) 
the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of 
section 75 or section 81; or  
(ii) 
it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law; or  

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 42 of 150 
 
 
significance of the newly inserted Explanation 1 in both 
the sections is two-fold. First, it does away with the use of 
words: (a) “without prejudice to the generality of sub-clause 
(ii)” in the opening part of the pre-amended Explanation to 
Section 34(2)(b)(ii); and (b) “without prejudice to the 
generality of clause (b) of this section” in the opening part 
of the pre-amended Explanation to Section 48(2)(b); 
secondly, it limits the expanse of public policy of India to 
the three specified categories by using the words “only if”. 
Whereas, Explanation 2 lays down the standard for 
adjudging whether there is a contravention with the 
fundamental policy of Indian law by providing that a 
review on merits of the dispute shall not be done. This 
limits the scope of the enquiry on an application under 
either Section 34(2)(b)(ii) or Section 48(2)(b) of the 1996 
Act. 
 
45. 
The Amendment, 2015 by inserting sub-section (2-
A)41 in Section 34, carves out an additional ground for 
annulment of an arbitral award arising out of arbitrations 
other than international commercial arbitrations. Sub-
section (2-A) provides that the Court may also set aside an 
award if that is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on 
the face of the award.  This power of the Court is, however, 
 
(iii) 
it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice. 
Explanation 2.-- For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the 
fundamental policy of Indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute. 
 
41 See Footnote 18 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021

circumscribed by the Proviso, which states that an award 
shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an 
erroneous application of the law or by re-appreciation of 
evidence. 
 
46. 
 Explanation 1 to Section 34(2)(b)(ii), specifies that 
an arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of 
India, only if,- (i)  the making of the award was induced or 
affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of 
Section 75 or Section 81; or (ii) it is in contravention with 
the fundamental policy of Indian law; or (iii) it is in conflict 
with the most basic notions of morality or justice.   
 
47. 
In the instant case, there is no allegation that the 
making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or 
corruption, or was in violation of Section 75 or Section 81. 
Therefore, we shall confine our exercise in assessing as to 
whether the arbitral award is in contravention with the 
fundamental policy of Indian law, and/ or whether it 
conflicts with the most basic notions of morality or justice. 
Additionally, in the light of the provisions of sub-section 
(2-A) of Section 34, we shall examine whether there is any 
patent illegality on the face of the award.  
  
48. 
Before undertaking the aforesaid exercise, it would 
be apposite to consider as to how the expressions (a) “in 
contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law”; 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 44 of 150 
 
 
(b) “in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or 
justice”; and (c) “patent illegality” have been construed.   
 
 
In contravention with the fundamental policy of 
Indian law 
 
49. 
As discussed above, till the Amendment, 2015 the 
expression “in contravention with the fundamental policy 
of Indian law” was not found in the 1996 Act. Yet, in 
Renusagar (supra), in the context of enforcement of a 
foreign award, while construing the phrase “contrary to 
the public policy”, this Court held that for a foreign award 
to be contrary to public policy mere contravention of law 
would not be enough rather it should be contrary to: (a) 
the fundamental policy of Indian law; and /or (b) the 
interest of India; and/ or (c) justice or morality.  
 
50. 
In the judicial pronouncements that followed 
Renusagar (supra), already discussed above, the domain 
of what could be considered contrary to the ‘public policy 
of India’/ ‘fundamental policy of Indian law’ expanded, 
resulting in much greater interference with arbitral 
awards than what the lawmakers intended. This led to the 
Amendment, 2015 in the 1996 Act.   
 
51. 
In Ssangyong Engineering (supra), this Court 
dealt with the effect of the Amendment, 2015. While doing 
so, it took note of a supplementary report of February 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021

2015 of the Law Commission of India made in the context 
of 
the 
proposed 
2015 
amendments. 
The 
said 
supplementary report has been extracted in paragraph 30 
of that judgment. The key features of it are summarized 
below: 
 
(a) Mere violation of law of India would not be a 
violation 
of 
public 
policy 
in 
cases 
of 
international commercial arbitrations held in 
India. 
 
(b) The proposed 2015 amendments in 1996 Act 
(i.e., 
in 
Sections 
34(2)(b)(ii) and 
48(2)(b) 
including insertion of sub-section (2-A) in 
Section 34) were on the assumption that the 
terms, such as, “fundamental policy of Indian 
law” or conflict with “most basic notions of 
morality or justice” would not be widely 
construed. 
 
(c) The power to review an award on merits is 
contrary to the object of the Act and 
international practice. 
 
(d) The judgment in Western Geco (supra) 
would expand the court’s power, contrary to 
international practice. Hence, a clarification 
needs to be incorporated to ensure that the term 
‘fundamental policy of Indian law’ is narrowly

construed. The applicability of Wednesbury 
principles to public policy will open the 
floodgates. Hence, Explanation 2 to Section 
34(2)(b)(ii) has been proposed. 
 
After taking note of the supplementary report, the 
statement of objects and reasons of the Amendment Act, 
2015, and the amended provisions of Sections 28, 34 and 
48, this Court held: 
 
“34. What is clear, therefore, is that the 
expression public policy of India, whether 
contained in section 34 or in section 48, would 
now mean the fundamental policy of Indian law 
as explained in paras 18 and 27 of Associate 
Builders i.e. the fundamental policy of Indian law 
would 
be 
relegated 
to 
Renusagar's 
understanding of this expression. This would 
necessarily mean that Western Geco expansion 
has been done away with. In short, Western 
Geco, as explained in Paras 28 and 29 of 
Associate Builders, would no longer obtain, as 
under the guise of interfering with an award on 
the ground that the arbitrator has not adopted a 
judicial approach the court’s intervention would 
be on the merits of the award, which cannot be 
permitted post amendment. However, in so far as 
principles of natural justice are concerned, as 
contained in sections 18 and 34(2)(a) (iii) of the 
1996 Act, these continue to be the grounds of 
challenge of an award, as is contained in para 30 
of Associate Builders. 
 
35.***** 
 
36****** 
 
37.  In so far as domestic awards made in India 
are concerned, an additional ground is now 
available under sub-section (2-A), added by the 
Amendment Act, 2015 to section 34. Here, there 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021

must be patent illegality appearing on the face of 
the award, which refers to such illegality as goes 
to the root of the matter, but which does not 
amount to mere erroneous application of the law. 
In short, what is not subsumed within the 
fundamental policy of Indian law, namely, the 
contravention of a statute not linked to public 
policy or public interest, cannot be brought in by 
the back door when it comes to setting aside an 
award on the ground of patent illegality.  
 
38. Secondly, it is also made clear that 
reappreciation of evidence, which is what an 
appellate court is permitted to do, cannot be 
permitted under the ground of patent illegality 
appearing on the face of the award. 
 
39. To elucidate, para 42.1 of Associate Builders, 
namely, a mere contravention of the substantive 
law of India, by itself, is no longer a ground 
available to set aside an arbitral award. Para 
42.2 of Associate Builders, however, would 
remain, for if an arbitrator gives no reasons for 
an award and contravenes section 31(3) of the 
1996 Act, that would certainly amount to a 
patent illegality on the face of the award.  
 
40. The change made in Section 28(3) by the 
Amendment Act really follows what is stated in 
paras 42.3 to 45 in Associate Builders, namely, 
that the construction of the terms of a contract 
is primarily for an arbitrator to decide, unless the 
arbitrator construes the contract in a manner 
that no fair minded or reasonable person would; 
in short, that the arbitrator’s view is not even a 
possible view to take. Also, if the arbitrator 
wanders outside the contract and deals with the 
matters not allotted to him, he commits an error 
of jurisdiction. This ground of challenge will now 
fall within the new ground added under Section 
34 (2-A). 
 
41. What is important to note is that a decision 
which is perverse, as understood in paras 31 and 
32 of Associate Builders, while no longer being a 
ground for challenge under “public policy of 
India”, would certainly amount to a patent 
illegality appearing on the face of the award. 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021

Thus, a finding based on no evidence at all or an 
award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at 
its decision would be perverse and liable to be set 
aside on the ground of patent illegality. 
Additionally, a finding based on documents 
taken behind the back of the parties by the 
arbitrator would also qualify as a decision based 
on no evidence inasmuch as such decision is not 
based on evidence led by the parties, and 
therefore, would also have to be characterized as 
perverse.  
 
********* ******* ******* 
69. We therefore hold, following the aforesaid 
authorities, that in the guise of misinterpretation 
of the contract, and consequent errors of 
jurisdiction, it is not possible to state that the 
arbitral award would be beyond the scope of 
submission to arbitration if otherwise the 
aforesaid 
misinterpretation 
[which 
would 
include going beyond the terms of the contract], 
could be said to have been fairly comprehended 
as disputes within the arbitration agreement or 
which were referred to the decision of the 
arbitrators as understood by the authorities 
above. If an arbitrator is alleged to have 
wandered outside the contract and dealt with 
matters not allotted to him, this would be a 
jurisdictional error which could be corrected on 
the ground of patent illegality, which, as we have 
seen, 
would 
not 
apply 
to 
international 
commercial arbitrations that are decided under 
Part II of the 1996 Act. To bring in by the back 
door grounds relatable to Section 28 (3) of the 
1996 Act to be matters beyond the scope of 
submission 
to 
arbitration 
under 
section 
34(2)(a)(iv) would not be permissible as this 
ground must be construed narrowly and so 
construed, must refer only to matters which are 
beyond the arbitration agreement or beyond the 
reference to the arbitral tribunal.” 
 
52. 
The legal position which emerges from the 
aforesaid discussion is that after the ‘2015 amendments’ 
in Section 34 (2)(b)(ii) and Section 48(2)(b) of the 1996 Act, 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 49 of 150 
 
 
the phrase “in conflict with the public policy of India” must 
be accorded a restricted meaning in terms of Explanation 
1. The expression “in contravention with the fundamental 
policy of Indian law” by use of the word ‘fundamental’ 
before the phrase ‘policy of Indian law’ makes the 
expression narrower in its application than the phrase “in 
contravention with the policy of Indian law”, which means 
mere contravention of law is not enough to make an award 
vulnerable. To bring the contravention within the fold of 
fundamental policy of Indian law, the award must 
contravene all or any of such fundamental principles that 
provide a basis for administration of justice and 
enforcement of law in this country. Without intending to 
exhaustively enumerate instances of such contravention, 
by way of illustration, it could be said that (a) violation of 
the principles of natural justice; (b) disregarding orders of 
superior courts in India or the binding effect of the 
judgment of a superior court; and (c) violating law of India 
linked to public good or public interest, are considered 
contravention of the fundamental policy of Indian law. 
However, while assessing whether there has been a 
contravention of the fundamental policy of Indian law, the 
extent of judicial scrutiny must not exceed the limit as set 
out in Explanation 2 to Section 34(2)(b)(ii).

Most basic notions of morality and justice 
 
53. 
In Renusagar (supra) this Court held that an 
arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India 
if it is, inter alia, contrary to “justice and morality”. 
Explanation 1, inserted by 2015 Amendment, makes it 
clear that an award is in conflict with the public policy of 
India, inter alia, if it conflicts with the ‘most basic notions 
of morality or justice’.  
 
Justice 
 
54. 
Justice is the virtue by which the society/ court / 
tribunal gives a man his due, opposed to injury or wrong. 
Justice is an act of rendering what is right and equitable 
towards one who has suffered a wrong. Therefore, while 
tempering justice with mercy, the court must be very 
conscious, that it has to do justice in exact conformity 
with some obligatory law, for the reason that human 
actions are found to be just or unjust on the basis of 
whether the same are in conformity with, or in opposition 
to, the law42. Therefore, in ‘judicial sense’, justice is 
nothing more nor less than exact conformity to some 
obligatory law; and all human actions are either just or 
unjust as they are in conformity with, or in opposition to, 
the law43.

55. 
 But, importantly, the term ‘legal justice’ is not 
used in Explanation 1, therefore simple conformity or non-
conformity with the law is not the test to determine 
whether an award is in conflict with the public policy of 
India in terms of Explanation 1.  The test is that it must 
conflict with the most basic notions of justice.  For lack of 
any objective criteria, it is difficult to enumerate the ‘most 
basic notions of justice’. More so, justice to one may be 
injustice 
to 
another. 
This 
difficulty 
has 
been 
acknowledged by many renowned jurists, as is reflected in 
the observations of this Court in Delhi Administration v. 
Gurdip Singh Uban44 , extracted below: 
 
“23. The words ‘justice’ and ‘injustice’, in our 
view, are sometimes loosely used and have 
different 
meanings 
to 
different 
persons 
particularly to those arrayed on opposite sides. 
One man's justice is another's injustice [Raplph 
Waldo Emerson: Essays (1803-82), First Series, 
1841, “Circles]. Justice Cardozo said: “The web 
is entangled and obscure, shot through with a 
multitude of shades and colors, the skeins 
irregular and broken. Many hues that seem to be 
simple, are found, when analyzed, to be a 
complex and uncertain blend. Justice itself, 
which we are wont to appeal to what as a test as 
well as an ideal, may mean different things to 
different minds and at different times. Attempts 
to objectify its standards or even to describe 
them have never wholly succeeded (Selected 
Writings of Cardozo, pp 223-224, Falcon 
Publications, 1947).”

56. 
In Associate Builders (supra), while this Court 
was dealing with the concept “public policy of India”, in 
the context of a Section 34 challenge prior to 2015 
amendment, it was held that an award can be said to be 
against justice only when it shocks the conscience of the 
court45.  The Court illustrated by stating that where an 
arbitral award, without recording reasons, awards an 
amount much more than what the claim is restricted to, it 
would certainly shock the conscience of the court and 
render the award vulnerable and liable to be set aside on 
the ground that it is contrary to justice. 
  
57. 
In Ssyangyong (supra), which dealt with post 
2015 amendment scenario, it was observed that an 
argument to set aside an award on the ground of being in 
conflict with ‘most basic notions of justice’, can be raised 
only in very exceptional circumstances, that is, when the 
conscience of the court is shocked by infraction of some 
fundamental principle of justice. Notably, in that case the 
majority award created a new contract for the parties by 
applying a unilateral circular, and by substituting a 
workable formula under the agreement by another, dehors 
the agreement. This, in the view of the Court, breached the 
fundamental principles of justice, namely, that a 
unilateral addition or alteration of a contract can never be 
foisted upon an unwilling party, nor can a party to the 
 
45 See paragraph 36 of the judgment in Associate Builders (supra) 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021

agreement be liable to perform a bargain not entered with 
the other party46.  However, a note of caution was 
expressed in the judgment by observing that this ground 
is available only in very exceptional circumstances and 
under no circumstance can any court interfere with an 
arbitral award on the ground that justice has not been 
done in the opinion of the court because that would be an 
entry into the merits of the dispute.  
 
58. 
In the light of the discussion above, in our view, 
when we talk about justice being done, it is about 
rendering, in accord with law, what is right and equitable 
to one who has suffered a wrong.  Justice is the virtue by 
which the society/ court / tribunal gives a man his due, 
opposed to injury or wrong. Dispensation of justice in its 
quality may vary, dependent on person who dispenses it. 
A trained judicial mind may dispense justice in a manner 
different from what a person of ordinary prudence would 
do. This is so, because a trained judicial mind is likely to 
figure out even minor infractions of law/ norms which may 
escape the attention of a person with ordinary prudence.  
Therefore, the placement of words “most basic notions” 
before “of justice” in Explanation 1 has its significance. 
Notably, at the time when the 2015 Amendment was 
brought, the existing law with regard to grounds for 
setting aside an arbitral award, as interpreted by this 
 
46 See paragraph 76 of the judgment in Ssyanyong (supra) 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021

Court, was that an arbitral award would be in conflict with 
public policy of India, if it is contrary to: (a) the 
fundamental policy of Indian law; (b) the interest of India; 
(c) justice or morality; and /or is (d) patently illegal.  As we 
have already noticed, the object of inserting Explanations 
1 and 2 in place of earlier explanation to Section 34(2)(b)(ii) 
was to limit the scope of interference with an arbitral 
award, therefore the amendment consciously qualified the 
term ‘justice’ with ‘most basic notions’ of it.  In such 
circumstances, giving a broad dimension to this category47 
would be deviating from the legislative intent. In our view, 
therefore, considering that the concept of justice is open- 
textured, and notions of justice could evolve with changing 
needs of the society, it would not be prudent to cull out 
“the most basic notions of justice”. Suffice it to observe, 
they48 ought to be such elementary principles of justice 
that their violation could be figured out by a prudent 
member of the public who may, or may not, be judicially 
trained, which means, that their violation would shock the 
conscience of a legally trained mind.  In other words, this 
ground would be available to set aside an arbitral award, 
if the award conflicts with such elementary/ fundamental 
principles of justice that it shocks the conscience of the 
Court.

Morality 
 
59. 
The other ground is of morality. On the question of 
morality, in Associate Builders (supra), this Court, after 
referring to the provisions of Section 23 of the Contract 
Act, 1872; earlier decision of this Court in Gherulal 
(supra); and Indian Contract Act by Pollock and Mulla, held 
that judicial precedents have confined morality to sexual 
morality. And if ‘morality’ were to go beyond sexual 
morality, it would cover such agreements as are not illegal 
but would not be enforced given the prevailing mores of 
the day. The court also clarified that interference on this 
ground would be only if something shocks the court’s 
conscience49.  
 
Patent Illegality 
 
60. 
 Sub-section (2-A) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act, 
which was inserted by 2015 Amendment, provides that an 
arbitral award not arising out of international commercial 
arbitrations, may also be set aside by the Court, if the 
Court finds that the award is visited by patent illegality 
appearing on the face of the award. The proviso to sub-
section (2-A) states that an award shall not be set aside 
merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the 
law or by reappreciation of evidence. In Saw Pipes (supra), 
while dealing with the phrase ‘public policy of India’ as 
 
49 See paragraph 39 of Associate Builders (supra) 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 56 of 150 
 
 
used in Section 34, this court took the view that the 
concept of public policy connotes some matter which 
concerns public good and public interest. If the award, on 
the face of it, patently violates statutory provisions, it 
cannot be said to be in public interest. Thus, an award 
could also be set aside if it is patently illegal. It was, 
however, clarified that illegality must go to the root of the 
matter and if the illegality is of trivial nature, it cannot be 
held that award is against public policy.  
   
61. 
In Associate Builders (supra), this Court held that 
an award would be patently illegal, if it is contrary to:  
(a) substantive provisions of law of India; 
(b) provisions of the 1996 Act; and 
(c) terms of the contract50. 
The Court clarified that if an award is contrary to the 
substantive provisions of law of India, in effect, it is in 
contravention of Section 28(1)(a)51 of the 1996 Act.  
Similarly, violating terms of the contract, in effect, is in 
contravention of Section 28(3) of the 1996 Act.

Prior to substitution by Act 3 of 2016, sub-section (3) of Section 28 read as under:

62. 
In Ssangyong (supra) this Court specifically dealt 
with the 2015 Amendment which inserted sub-section (2-
A) in Section 34 of the 1996 Act. It was held that “patent 
illegality appearing on the face of the award” refers to such 
illegality as goes to the root of matter, but which does not 
amount to mere erroneous application of law.  It was also 
clarified that what is not subsumed within “the 
fundamental 
policy 
of 
Indian 
law”, 
namely, 
the 
contravention of a statute not linked to ‘public policy’ or 
‘public interest’, cannot be brought in by the backdoor 
when it comes to setting aside an award on the ground of 
patent illegality52. Further, it was observed, reappreciation 
of evidence is not permissible under this category of 
challenge to an arbitral award53. 
 
Perversity as a ground of challenge 
  
63. 
Perversity as a ground for setting aside an arbitral 
award was recognized in Western Geco (supra).  Therein 
it was observed that an arbitral decision must not be 
perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would 
have arrived at the same. It was observed that if an award 
is perverse, it would be against the public policy of India. 
 
 
52 See paragraph 37 of Ssyangyong (supra)

Page 58 of 150 
 
 
64. 
In Associate Builders (supra) certain tests were 
laid down to determine whether a decision of an arbitral 
tribunal could be considered perverse.  In this context, it 
was observed that where: (i) a finding is based on no 
evidence; or (ii) an arbitral tribunal takes into account 
something irrelevant to the decision which it arrives at; or 
(iii) ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision, such 
decision would necessarily be perverse. However, by way 
of a note of caution, it was observed that when a court 
applies these tests it does not act as a court of appeal and, 
consequently, errors of fact cannot be corrected. Though, 
a possible view by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily 
to pass muster as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of 
the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied upon. It 
was also observed that an award based on little evidence 
or on evidence which does not measure up in quality to a 
trained legal mind would not be held to be invalid on that 
score. 
 
65. 
In Ssangyong (supra), which dealt with the legal 
position post 2015 amendment in Section 34 of the 1996 
Act, it was observed that a decision which is perverse, 
while no longer being a ground for challenge under “public 
policy of India”, would certainly amount to a patent 
illegality appearing on the face of the award.  It was 
pointed out that an award based on no evidence, or which 
ignores vital evidence, would be perverse and thus 
patently illegal. It was also observed that a finding based 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 59 of 150 
 
 
on documents taken behind the back of the parties by the 
arbitrator would also qualify as a decision based on no 
evidence in as much as such decision is not based on 
evidence led by the parties, and therefore, would also have 
to be characterized as perverse54.   
 
66. 
The tests laid down in Associate Builders (supra) 
to determine perversity were followed in Ssyanyong 
(supra) and later approved by a three-Judge Bench of this 
Court in Patel Engineering Limited v. North Eastern 
Electric Power Corporation Limited55. 
 
67. 
In a recent three-Judge Bench decision of this 
Court in Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v. Delhi 
Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.56, the ground of patent 
illegality /perversity was delineated in the following terms: 
 
 
“40. In essence, the ground of patent illegality is 
available for setting aside a domestic award, if 
the decision of the arbitrator is found to be 
perverse, or so irrational that no reasonable 
person would have arrived at it; or the 
construction of the contract is such that no fair 
or reasonable person would take; Or, that the 
view of the arbitrator is not even a possible view. 
A finding based on no evidence at all or an award 
which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its 
decision would be perverse and liable to be set 
aside under the head of patent illegality. An 
award without reasons would suffer from patent 
illegality. The arbitrator commits a patent

illegality by deciding a matter not within its 
jurisdiction or violating a fundamental principle 
of natural justice.”  
 
 
Scope of interference with an arbitral award 
 
68. 
The aforesaid judicial precedents make it clear 
that while exercising power under Section 34 of the 1996 
Act the Court does not sit in appeal over the arbitral 
award. Interference with an arbitral award is only on 
limited grounds as set out in Section 34 of the 1996 Act. 
A possible view by the arbitrator on facts is to be respected 
as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and 
quality of evidence to be relied upon. It is only when an 
arbitral award could be categorized as perverse, that on 
an error of fact an arbitral award may be set aside. 
Further, a mere erroneous application of the law or wrong 
appreciation of evidence by itself is not a ground to set 
aside an award as is clear from the provisions of sub-
section (2-A) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act.   
 
69. 
In Dyna Technologies (supra), a three-Judge 
Bench of this Court held that Courts need to be cognizant 
of the fact that arbitral awards are not to be interfered with 
in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the court 
concludes that the perversity of the award goes to the root 
of the matter and there is no possibility of an alternative 
interpretation that may sustain the arbitral award. It was 
observed that jurisdiction under Section 34 cannot be 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 61 of 150 
 
 
equated with the normal appellate jurisdiction. Rather, 
the approach ought to be to respect the finality of the 
arbitral award as well as party's autonomy to get their 
dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided 
under the law.   
 
70. 
Now, we shall examine the scope of interference 
with an arbitral award on ground of insufficient, or 
improper/erroneous, or lack of, reasons.     
  
Reasons for the Award – When reasons, or lack of it, 
could vitiate an arbitral award. 
 
 
71. 
Section 31 (3)57 of the 1996 Act provides that an 
arbitral award shall state reasons upon which it is based, 
unless (a) the parties have agreed that no reasons are to 
be given, or (b) the award is an arbitral award on agreed 
terms under Section 30.  
 
71.1 
As to the form of a reasoned award, in Russell on 
Arbitration (24th Edition, page 304) it is stated thus:  
 
“6.032. No particular form is required for a reasoned 
award although ‘the giving of clearly expressed reasons 
responsive to the issues as they were debated before the 
arbitrators reduces the scope for 
the making of 
unmeritorious challenges’. When giving a reasoned award 
the tribunal need only set out what, on its view of the 
evidence, did or did not happen and explain succinctly 
 
57 Section 31. Form and contents of arbitral award. – (1) ….. (2)…. 
(3) The arbitral award shall state the reasons upon which it is based, unless – 
(a) the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be given, or  
(b) the award is an arbitral award on agreed terms under section 30.

why, in the light of what happened, the tribunal has 
reached its decision, and state what that decision is. In 
order to avoid being vulnerable to challenge, the tribunal’s 
reasons must deal with all the issues that were put to it. It 
should set out its findings of fact and its reasoning so as to 
enable the parties to understand them and state why 
particular points were decisive. It should also indicate the 
tribunal’s findings and reasoning on issues argued before 
it but not considered decisive, so as to enable the parties 
and the court to consider the position with respect to 
appeal on all the issues before the tribunal. When dealing 
with controversial matters, it is helpful for the tribunal to 
set out not only its view of what occurred, but also to make 
it clear that it has considered any alternative version and 
has rejected it. Even if several reasons lead to the same 
result, the tribunal should still set them out. That said, so 
long as the relevant issues are addressed there is no need 
to deal with every possible argument or to explain why the 
tribunal attached more weight to some evidence than to 
other evidence. The tribunal is not expected to recite at 
great length communications exchanged or submissions 
made by the parties. Nor is it required to set out each step 
by which it reached its conclusion or to deal with each and 
every point made by the parties. It is sufficient that the 
tribunal should explain what its findings are and the 
evidential route by which it reached its conclusions.  
 
71.2 On the requirement of recording reasons in an 
arbitral award and consequences of lack of, or inadequate, 
reasons in an arbitral award, this Court in Dyna 
Technologies (supra) held: 
 
“34. The mandate under section 31 (3) of the 
Arbitration Act is to have reasoning which is 
intelligible and adequate and, which can in 
appropriate cases be even implied by the courts 
from a fair reading of the award and documents 
referred to thereunder, if need be. The aforesaid 
provision does not require an elaborate judgment 
to be passed by the arbitrators having regard to 
the speedy resolution of dispute.  
35. When we consider the requirement of a 
reasoned order, three characteristics of a 
reasoned order can be fathomed. They are: 
proper, 
intelligible 
and 
adequate. 
If 
the 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 63 of 150 
 
 
reasonings in the order are improper, they reveal 
a flaw in the decision-making process. If the 
challenge to an award is based on impropriety or 
perversity in the reasoning, then it can be 
challenged strictly on the grounds provided in 
section 34 of the Arbitration Act. If the challenge 
to an award is based on the ground that the 
same is unintelligible, the same would be 
equivalent of providing no reasons at all. Coming 
to the last aspect concerning the challenge on 
adequacy of reasons, the court while exercising 
jurisdiction under section 34 has to adjudicate 
the validity of such an award based on the degree 
of particularity of reasoning required having 
regard to the nature of issues falling for 
consideration. The degree of particularity cannot 
be stated in a precise manner as the same would 
depend on the complexity of the issue even if the 
court comes to a conclusion that there were gaps 
in the reasoning for the conclusions reached by 
the tribunal, the court needs to have regard to 
the document submitted by the parties and the 
contentions raised before the tribunal so that 
awards with inadequate reasons are not set 
aside in casual and cavalier manner. On the 
other hand, ordinarily unintelligible awards are 
to be set aside, subject to party autonomy to do 
away with the reasoned award. Therefore, the 
courts 
are 
required 
to 
be 
careful 
while 
distinguishing between inadequacy of reasons in 
an award and unintelligible awards.”  
 
 
71.3.  We find ourselves in agreement with the view 
taken in Dyna Technologies (supra), as extracted 
above. Therefore, in our view, for the purposes of 
addressing an application to set aside an arbitral award 
on the ground of improper or inadequate reasons, or 
lack of reasons, awards can broadly be placed in three 
categories: 
 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 64 of 150 
 
 
(1) where no reasons are recorded, or the 
reasons recorded are unintelligible; 
(2) where reasons are improper, that is, they 
reveal a flaw in the decision- making process; 
and 
(3) where reasons appear inadequate. 
 
71.4. Awards falling in category (1) are vulnerable as 
they would be in conflict with the provisions of Section 
31(3) of the 1996 Act. Therefore, such awards are liable 
to be set aside under Section 34, unless (a) the parties 
have agreed that no reasons are to be given, or (b) the 
award is an arbitral award on agreed terms under 
Section 30. 
 
71.5. Awards falling in category (2) are amenable to a 
challenge on ground of impropriety or perversity, strictly 
in accordance with the grounds set out in Section 34 of 
the 1996 Act. 
 
71.6. Awards falling in category (3) require to be dealt 
with care. In a challenge to such award, before taking a 
decision the Court must take into consideration the 
nature of the issues arising between the parties in the 
arbitral proceedings and the degree of reasoning 
required to address them. The Court must thereafter 
carefully peruse the award, and the documents referred 
to therein. If reasons are intelligible and adequate on a 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 65 of 150 
 
 
fair-reading of the award and, in appropriate cases, 
implicit in the documents referred to therein, the award 
is not to be set aside for inadequacy of reasons. 
However, if gaps are such that they render the reasoning 
in support of the award unintelligible, or lacking, the 
Court exercising power under Section 34 may set aside 
the award.  
 
Scope of interference with the interpretation / 
construction of a contract accorded in an arbitral 
award. 
 
72. 
An arbitral tribunal must decide in accordance 
with the terms of the contract. In a case where an arbitral 
tribunal passes an award against the terms of the 
contract, the award would be patently illegal. However, an 
arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction to interpret a contract 
having regard to terms and conditions of the contract, 
conduct 
of 
the 
parties 
including 
correspondences 
exchanged, circumstances of the case and pleadings of the 
parties.  If the conclusion of the arbitrator is based on a 
possible view of the matter, the Court should not 
intefere58.   But where, on a full reading of the contract, 
the view of the arbitral tribunal on the terms of a contract 
is not a possible view, the award would be considered 
perverse and as such amenable to interference59.

Whether unexpressed term can be read into a contract 
as an implied condition. 
 
73. 
Ordinarily, terms of the contract are to be 
understood in the way the parties wanted and intended 
them to be. In agreements of arbitration, where party 
autonomy is the grund norm, how the parties worked out 
the agreement, is one of the indicators to decipher the 
intention, apart from the plain or grammatical meaning of 
the expressions used60.  
 
74. 
However, reading an unexpressed term in an 
agreement would be justified on the basis that such a term 
was always and obviously intended by the parties thereto. 
An unexpressed term can be implied if, and only if, the 
court finds that the parties must have intended that term 
to form part of their contract. It is not enough for the court 
to find that such a term would have been adopted by the 
parties as reasonable men if it had been suggested to 
them. Rather, it must have been a term that went without 
saying, a term necessary to give business efficacy to the 
contract, a term which, although tacit, forms part of the 
contract61.

Page 67 of 150 
 
 
75. 
But before an implied condition, not expressly 
found in the contract, is read into a contract, by invoking 
the business efficacy doctrine, it must satisfy following five 
conditions:  
 
a. it must be reasonable and equitable; 
b. it must be necessary to give business efficacy to 
the contract, that is, a term will not be implied if 
the contract is effective without it;  
c. it must be obvious that “it goes without saying”; 
d. it must be capable of clear expression; 
e. it must not contradict any terms of the contract62. 
 
ANALYSIS/ DISCUSSION 
 
76. 
Having noticed the legal principles governing a 
challenge to an arbitral award, we shall now proceed to 
address the issues culled out above, which arise for our 
consideration in these appeals.   
 
 
GITA POWER (R-2) BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION 
AGREEMENT 
AND 
THEREFORE 
JOINTLY 
AND 
SEVERALLY LIABLE  
 
77. 
To have a clear understanding of the issue as to 
whether Gita Power (R-2), the appellant in the connected 
appeal, could be subjected to arbitral proceedings and 
 
62 Nabha Power Limited (NPL) v. Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) and Another, (2018) 11 SCC 
508, followed in Adani Power (supra) 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 68 of 150 
 
 
made jointly and severally liable along with OPG for the 
dues of Enexio, a look at the facts relating to formation of 
the contract including the conduct of the parties would be 
apposite.  
 
78. The relevant facts in this regard, which find mention 
in the award, are as follows:  
 
(a) There were two companies, namely, Gita Power 
(R-2) and OPG (appellant). Gita Power is the 
holding company of OPG. Two Tenders were 
floated. One by a Gujarat Company in the same 
group, which related to design, manufacture, 
delivery 
to 
site, 
erection 
testing 
and 
commissioning of two ACC units with auxiliaries 
for a thermal power plant in Gujarat (for short 
Gujarat Unit). The other was issued by OPG in 
respect of design, manufacture, delivery to site, 
erection testing and commissioning of an ACC unit 
with auxiliaries for a thermal power plant at 
Gummidipoondi in Tamil Nadu (for short T.N. 
Unit).  
 
(b) Enexio (R-1 – the claimant) submitted a single 
unpriced techno-commercial offer covering both 
projects. Following negotiations, a revised techno 
commercial offer covering both projects was 
submitted in August 2012. Thereafter, following 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 69 of 150 
 
 
further negotiations, another technical offer 
covering both projects was submitted by Enexio on 
6 October 2012.  
 
(c) On 5 November 2012, with reference to the 
techno offers, OPG addressed a letter to Enexio, in 
respect of T.N. Unit, stating thus: 
“Design, 
Engineering, 
Supply, 
Installation, 
Testing and Commissioning of Air Cooled 
Condenser with auxiliaries for 1 X 160 MW 
(Phase III) Coal Based Power Project at 
Gummudipoondi. 
 
We refer to your offer GCTQD/ OPG - Gujarat – 
Gummidipoondi /4239/12 / Rev 2 dated 
October 6, 2012 and technical and commercial 
discussions we had with you of date. We have 
pleasure in informing you of our intent to award 
a contract for Air Cooled Condenser with 
auxiliaries in conformance to the discussions 
you had with us. 
 
Price: The price for the total scope is Rs. 
44,00,00,000/- (Forty four crores only). 
 
Price basis: F.O.R. destination (Power Project site 
at Gummidipoondi) 
 
Taxes and Duties: Extra at actuals, but inclusive 
of port handling charges. 
 
Delivery schedule: The overall agreed time for 
takeover of equipment will be March 2014.” 
 
(d)  On 4 March 2013, Gita Power (R-2), holding 
company of OPG, issued two separate Purchase 
Orders for: 
(i) Design, Engineering and Supply of 1 
Unit of ACC with Auxiliaries for 160 MW Coal 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 70 of 150 
 
 
Based project at Gummidipoondi (Supply 
Purchase Order); and 
 
(ii) Erection and Commissioning of 1 
Unit of ACC with Auxiliaries for 160 MW Coal 
Based Power project at Gummidipoondi 
(Erection Purchase Order). 
 
(e)  Pursuant to these purchase orders, on 1 April 
2013 Enexio (R-1) submitted a Work Schedule. As 
per which, commissioning of the ACC Unit was 
planned on 31 March 2014.  
 
(f)    On 13 June 2013, the foundations for the ACC 
Unit were handed over to Enexio (R-1) by OPG. 
 
(g) On 4 July 2013 Enexio received 10% of the 
Order price and on 23 July 2013 second payment 
of 10% of the Order price was received by Enexio. 
Both payments were made by Gita Power (R-2). 
 
(h) While the work was in progress, OPG issued 
two separate Purchase Orders, namely, supply 
purchase order and erection purchase order, on 
similar terms and with similar references as were 
there in the Purchase Orders issued by R-2 (Gita 
Power). 
 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 71 of 150 
 
 
(i) In the statement of defense, it was stated that 
when the purchase orders were ready for issue, 
since Gita Power (R-2) was the holding company of 
OPG, it was felt that in the commercial interest of 
the project, the order for supply and erection of 
ACC Unit should be placed on the claimant by R-
2. The statement of defense further states that 
soon after issuance of the purchase orders in the 
beginning of April 2013, OPG and R-2 were advised 
that as the project was being set up by OPG, and 
it had all the required registrations, etc. it would 
be advisable that the Purchase Orders placed on 
the claimant by R-2 for supply and erection of ACC 
Unit be substituted/ replaced by Purchase Orders 
in the name of OPG. In addition to above, OPG 
pleaded that the substitution/ replacement of 
purchase orders maintained the continuity of the 
rights and obligations undertaken from 4 March 
2013. 
 
79. Based on the above-noted facts, and the evidence 
brought on record during the arbitral proceedings, the 
Tribunal concluded that the ‘Group of Companies’ 
doctrine is applicable, as OPG and R-2 have represented 
themselves as a single economic entity which could switch 
duties and obligations from one to the other. The Tribunal 
held that – (a) R-2 is a proper party; (b) both OPG and R-
2 were bound by the arbitration agreements, which gave 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 72 of 150 
 
 
rise to the arbitral proceedings; and (c) OPG and R-2 were 
jointly and severally liable to the claimant for complying 
with the award. 
 
80. In Cox & Kings Ltd. v. SAP India (P) Ltd.63, a 
Constitution Bench of this Court held that by interpreting 
the express language employed by the parties in the record 
of agreement, coupled with surrounding circumstances of 
its formation, performance, and discharge of the contract, 
a Court or Arbitral Tribunal is empowered to determine 
whether a non-signatory is a party to an arbitration 
agreement. It was held that ‘Group of Companies’ doctrine 
is premised on ascertaining the intention of the non- 
signatory to be party to an arbitration agreement. The 
doctrine requires the intention to be gathered from 
additional factors such as direct relationship with the 
signatory 
parties, 
commonality 
of 
subject 
matter, 
composite nature of the transaction, and performance of 
the contract.  
 
81. 
In the instant case, the Arbitral Tribunal has found 
that: (a) Gita Power is the holding company of OPG; (b)  
Gita Power had issued the Purchase Orders and had 
actively participated in the formation of the contract even 
though the ACC unit of Gummudipoondi was of OPG; (c) 
initial 10% of the purchase price was provided by Gita 
 
63 (2024) 4 SCC 1 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 73 of 150 
 
 
Power (R-2); (d) the subsequent Purchase Orders issued 
by OPG were on similar terms and were issued by way of 
affirmation to obviate technical issues.  In our view, the 
above circumstances had a material bearing for invocation 
of “Group of Companies doctrine” to bind Gita Power (R-2) 
with the arbitration agreement and fasten it with liability, 
jointly and severally with OPG, in respect of the Purchase 
Orders relating to ACC Unit of Gummudipoondi project.  
Thus, bearing in mind that an arbitral tribunal has 
jurisdiction to interpret a contract having regard to the 
terms and conditions of the contract and conduct of the 
parties including correspondences exchanged, and, 
further, taking into account the provisions of sub-section 
(2-A) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act limiting the scope of 
interference with a finding returned in an arbitral award, 
we do not find a good reason to interfere with the above 
findings of the Arbitral Tribunal more so when it is based 
on a possible view of the matter. We, therefore, reject the 
argument on behalf of R-2 that it was not bound by the 
arbitration agreement and that it ought not to have been 
made jointly and severally liable along with OPG for the 
dues payable to Enexio. Sub-issue (a) is decided in the 
aforesaid terms. 
 
 
ENEXIO’S CLAIM NOT BARRED BY LIMITATION. 
 
82. On the issue as to whether Enexio’s claim was barred 
by time, the submissions of the appellants, inter alia, are: 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 74 of 150 
 
 
 
(a) The date fixed by the contract for 
completion of the obligations of supply of 
goods and erection of ACC unit is 31 March 
2014. Hence, the date of reckoning for the 
purposes of limitation ought to be 31 March 
2014. 
 
(b) The contract was a mixture of supply of 
goods and services (i.e., works). Therefore, 
Article 14 of the Schedule to the 1963 Act 
applied for the price of goods supplied, and 
Article 18 applied for the price of works 
provided, for computing the limitation period 
of the claim.  In either case, the limitation 
period of three years would commence to run, 
not later than, from 31 March 2014.  
 
(c)  Even if it is assumed that the deemed date 
of completion was 21 September 2015 (as 
held by the arbitral tribunal), the claim being 
filed on 2 May 2019, was well beyond 3 years 
from that date.   
 
(d) Once the period of limitation started to 
run, in terms of Articles 14 and 18, mere 
negotiations could not have extended the 
period of limitation. Therefore, the award, 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 75 of 150 
 
 
which takes a contrary view, is patently 
illegal. 
 
83. 
Before proceeding further, we must remind 
ourselves that sub-section (1) of Section 4364 of the 1996 
Act makes the Limitation Act, 1963 (in short, 1963 Act) 
applicable to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in 
Court.  Sub-section (2) of Section 43 provides that unless 
otherwise agreed by the parties, an arbitral proceeding 
shall be deemed to have commenced on the date specified 
in Section 2165. On a conjoint reading of sub-sections (1) 
and (2) of Section 43 of the 1996 Act along with Sections 
 
64 Section 43. Limitations. – (1) The Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963) shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to 
proceedings in Court. 
 
(2) For the purposes of this section and the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), an arbitration shall be 
deemed to have commenced on the date referred in section 21. 
 
(3) Where an arbitration agreement to submit future disputes to arbitration provides that any claim to 
which the agreement applies shall be barred unless some step to commence arbitral proceedings is taken 
within the time specified by the agreement, and a dispute arises to which the agreement applies, the court, if it 
is of opinion that in the circumstances of the case undue hardship would otherwise be caused, and 
notwithstanding that the time so fixed has expired, may on such terms, if any, as the justice of the case may 
require, extend the time for such period as it thinks proper. 
 
(4) Where the Court orders that an arbitral award be set aside, the period between the 
commencement of the declaration and the date of the order of the court shall be excluded in computing the 
time prescribed by the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), for the commencement of the proceedings (including 
arbitration) with respect to the dispute so submitted. 
65 Section 21. Commencement of arbitral proceedings. -- Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral 
proceedings in respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be 
referred to arbitration is received by the respondent.  

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 76 of 150 
 
 
366 and 2 (j)67 of the 1963 Act it is clear that if on the date 
of commencement of the arbitral proceeding, as referred 
to in Section 21 of the 1996 Act, the claim(s) is/are barred 
by limitation, as per the provisions of the 1963 Act, the 
Arbitral Tribunal will have to reject such claim(s) as barred 
by limitation68.  
 
84. 
In the case in hand there is no dispute between the 
parties that the arbitral proceedings, in terms of Section 
21 of the 1996 Act, commenced on 2 May 2019.  Therefore, 
our exercise would be to determine whether the period of 
limitation got over prior to that date or not.  For that 
purpose, it would be necessary to ascertain as to which 
Article of the Schedule was applicable to the claim. And if 
more than one applied, which one applied to which part of 
the claim.  
 
66 Section 3. — Bar of limitation. – (1) Subject to the provisions contained in sections 4 to 24 inclusive, every 
suit instituted, appeal preferred, and application made after the prescribed period shall be dismissed, although 
limitation has not been set up as a defense.

According to the appellant(s) (i.e., OPG and Gita 
Power – appellant in the connected appeal), Articles 14 
and 18 of the Schedule to the 1963 Act applied to the 
claim. Importantly, the award does not specify the 
Article(s) which were applied except Article 58 which was 
applied to the declaratory relief sought in the claim and 
which was found barred by time. However, as the claim is 
based on a contract, we will also consider the applicability 
of Article 55 and the residuary Article 113 of the 
Schedule69, if none other Article(s) were applicable to the 
claim.

Facts having material bearing on limitation 
 
86. 
For a proper determination of the aforesaid issue, 
we need to have a close look at the material facts relevant 
to the issue of limitation.  In our view, the material facts70, 
inter alia, are: 
 
(a) There was a composite Tender inviting offer 
for design, manufacture, delivery to site, 
erection, testing and commissioning of an ACC 
unit with auxiliaries for a thermal power plant.  
 
(b) Enexio submitted a composite unpriced 
techno-commercial offer for the project.  
 
(c) On 5 November 2012, with reference to the 
techno 
offer, 
OPG 
addressed 
a 
letter71  
expressing intent to award contract for the 
project at a composite cost of 44 crores. This 
letter also sets out a tentative date for 
completion / takeover of the project i.e., March 
2014. 
 
113. 
 
Any suit for which 
      Three years 
 
When the right to sue accrues.  
 
 
no period of limitation  
 
 
is provided elsewhere  
 
 
in this Schedule   
 
70 As gathered from paragraph 7 (including sub paragraphs 7.01 to 7.76) of the Arbitral Award under the title 
‘Background to the Dispute’ 
71 Quoted in paragraph 79 (c) above 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021

(d) In that backdrop, on 4 March 2013, Gita 
Power (R-2) issued two separate orders, one, for 
Design, Engineering and Supply of 1 Unit of 
ACC with Auxiliaries (Supply Purchase Order) 
and, second, for Erection and Commissioning of 
it (Erection Purchase Order). 
  
(e) Pursuant to these purchase orders, on 1 
April 2013, Enexio (R-1) submitted a Work 
Schedule. As per which, commissioning of the 
ACC Unit was planned on 31 March 2014. In 
furtherance thereof, Enexio received 10% of the 
order price in advance on 4 July 2013, and 
another 10% on 23 July 2013. Both the 
advance payments were received from Gita 
Power (R-2).  
 
(f) While the work was in progress, in July 2013 
OPG issued two orders replicating those that 
were 
issued 
by 
Gita 
Power 
(R-2) 
with 
insignificant variation.  
 
(g) As per the Supply Purchase Order, payments 
were to be made in the following order: 
 
 
Payments: 
(i) 10% of Order Price as advance money 
on submission of request for advance 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 80 of 150 
 
 
and advance payment bank guarantee 
for 10% of the Order Price, valid until 
completion of supply; 
 
(ii) 10% against approval of Engineering 
Documentation; 
 
(iii) 65% of the Order Price on Pro Rata 
basis along with 100% taxes after 
receipt of material at site; 
 
(iv) 5% of the Order Price upon 
submission of (a) invoice, and (b) 
certificate on completion of punch 
points duly signed by Parties; 
 
(v) 5% of the Contract Price upon 
submission of (a) invoice, (b) take over 
certificate of Equipment issued by 
Purchaser; and (iii) warranty bond for 
10% of the contract valid up to the end 
of warranty period; 
 
(vi) 5% of the Contract Price upon 
submission of (a) invoice, (b) certificate 
of completion of performance test of 
equipment by purchaser;

Page 81 of 150 
 
 
(vii) Payments to be made within 25 
days of submission of invoice/ request 
for payment and other documents 
 
(h) Annexure A of the Supply Purchase Order 
carried commercial conditions, inter alia, 
providing for Performance Guarantee Test in 
the following terms: 
 
(1) The Performance Guarantee Test of 
the equipment shall be carried out 
immediately 
after 
takeover 
of 
the 
equipment but in no case later than two 
months from the date of takeover. 
 
(2) Performance guarantee test will be 
carried out by the representatives and 
manpower of the purchaser under the 
supervision of the supplier’s engineer. 
 
(3) In case the performance guarantee 
test is not carried out due to reasons 
outside supplier’s control within 180 
days from the date of takeover, the 
guaranteed 
performance 
shall 
be 
deemed to have been achieved and all 
liabilities of supplier with respect to the 
performance guarantee test shall be

over. Within these said 180 days, the 
supplier 
remains 
liable 
for 
the 
guaranteed 
performance 
of 
the 
equipment. 
 
 
(4) 
The 
Erection 
Purchase 
Order 
repeated most of the clauses of the 
supply purchase order and provided for 
payment in the following manner: 
 
Payment 
(i) 80% against progress of work on 
pro 
rata 
basis 
and 
against 
certification by site officials. 
 
(ii) 
10% 
after 
mechanical 
completion / Punch list. 
 
(iii) 10% of the contract price after 
Commissioning 
against 
bank 
guarantee in favor of the owner for 
equivalent value and valid for the 
entire warranty period. 
 
(j) Enexio (R-1) asserted that it finished its work 
under the contract on or about February 2015. 
However, on 12 March 2015, OPG complained 
to Enexio in writing that certain work remained 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 83 of 150 
 
 
and, therefore, Enexio must instruct its team to 
complete the pending work.  
 
(k) Enexio claimed that successful operation of 
the vacuum pump was carried out on 21 May 
2015, which implies commissioning of the ACC 
unit. In response OPG asserted that three 
components of the ACC unit were defective.  
 
(l) On 2 July 2015, OPG issued a debit note 
towards modifications to the turbine generator 
building. Thereafter, on 24 August 2015, OPG 
issued two debit notes: (i) towards work related 
to lifting of the vertical duct; and (ii) towards 
liquidated damages permissible under the 
Supply Purchase Order and Erection Purchase 
Order for the delay in execution.  
 
(m) On 28 August 2015 Enexio wrote to OPG 
questioning the debit notes.  
 
(n) On 21 September 2015 Enexio informed 
OPG that the turbine generator was running at 
full load and, thereby, requested OPG to 
arrange for Performance Guarantee Test (PG 
Test). This request was repeated by e-mails 
dated 3 October 2015 and 8 October 2015. 
Later, on 9 October 2015, Enexio sent a letter 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 84 of 150 
 
 
to OPG attaching six protocols confirming 
commissioning of all relevant segments of the 
project. Not only that, on 20 October 2015, 
Enexio sent a procedure for the PG Test. But 
the PG Test was not undertaken. 
 
(o) On 12 January 2016, OPG issued debit note 
against OPG’s account for customs duty.  
 
(p) On 22 August 2016 OPG informed Enexio 
that fan assembly had detached. On 20 
January 2017 Enexio sent an e-mail to OPG, 
saying:  
“Sir, 
This is further to our visit to your site on 
7/1/2016.  
Considering the time availability and on 
the interest of closing the issue, we suggest the 
following:  
1. 
Using in-situ machining agency, 
the shaft dia variation can be machined 
out after dismantling the hub and blade 
assembly alone. Gearbox will not be 
disturbed at all. We already obtained 
offer for this. 
2. 
To match the machined out shaft 
dia and key way, existing fan hub bore 
and key way can be rebuild and 
machined after machining out existing 
bore by 5mm. 
3. 
To start the work, the spare 
gearbox supplied by us at free of cost 
can be used and remaining seven gear 
boxes can be attended one or two at a 
time. 
4. 
You being a valuable customer to 
us, we wish to execute the correction 
work even though this failure happened 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 85 of 150 
 
 
after our guarantee. We will depute our 
engineer to site for entire work. 
5. 
But we could not bear the 
commercial 
implications 
since 
we 
already suffered loss and our money is 
also locked up in this project due to 
various reasons cited in our various 
earlier letters. 
6. 
Hence, we request you to pay the 
correction cost and not to deduct the 
same from us. 
We request you for above proposal.” 
 
(q) On 2 March 2017 Enexio requested OPG to 
provide 
certificates 
for 
completion 
of 
Gummudipoondi as well as Gujarat project. The 
format of the desired certificate was sent by 
Enexio to OPG. Therein it was mentioned that 
ACC Unit was commissioned during May 2015 
and was performing satisfactorily since then.   
 
(r) On 6 March 2017 OPG confirmed that it 
would 
issue 
the 
required 
certificate 
for 
marketing purpose and that certificate would 
not absolve the claimant from its contractual 
obligations under the purchase orders which, 
according to OPG, were yet to be fulfilled. 
 
(s) Following further exchanges between the 
parties, a meeting was held on 19 April 2018. 
The minutes72 of that meeting, inter alia, 
 
72 See Paragraph 7 of this judgment. 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 86 of 150 
 
 
reflected that the principal amount outstanding 
towards Enexio under the contract was the one 
that was claimed by Enexio in the claim. 
However, the minutes indicated that it was not 
payable because of certain deductions claimed 
by OPG. According to Enexio, those deductions 
(i.e. towards customs duty and liquidated 
damages) were incorrectly recorded in the 
minutes even though there was no agreement 
in respect thereof.  
 
(t) On 26 May 2018, on reiteration of demand 
by 
Enexio, 
OPG 
responded, 
vide 
communication dated 26 May 2018, and offered 
Rs.3 crores to Enexio as full and final 
settlement of the account. This offer was 
rejected by Enexio. Whereafter, arbitration 
proceeding commenced.  
 
Material Observations in the Award. 
 
87. 
We shall now extract few observations/ findings in 
the award which, in our view, would be useful in 
determining the limitation issue. These observations/ 
findings, with their corresponding paragraph number in 
the award, are extracted below: 
 
“1). On 1st April 2013 the Claimant prepared its 
L1 Network Schedule which indicated the final 
activities leading to commissioning ..: 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 87 of 150 
 
 
Hook up with TG: 8-Mar-14 to 14-Mar-14      
Commissioning 22-Mar-14 to 31-Mar-14. 
……(para 13.02 of the award) 
 
2). 
The Purchase Orders are silent on the mode 
of payment of the Claimant’s invoices except to 
note that: 
7.3.  65% of the Order Price shall be paid on Pro 
rata basis along with 100% Taxes and Duties 
after receipt of material at site. 
7.7   Payments will be made within twenty-five 
days of submission of Invoice/ request for 
payment and other documents.  
….. (para 13.08 (b) of the award) 
 
3). 
No indication is given in the Purchase 
Orders as to what ‘other documents are required.   
 
 
…..(para 13.08 (c) of the award) 
 
4). The claimant asserts that until November 
2013 payments were made to the claimant 
initially by Respondent no.2 and subsequently 
by Respondent no.1 by cheque/ RTGS but from 
12th November 2013 all subsequent payments 
were made by letter of credit. In order to receive 
payment by this method the claimant asserts 
that additional documentation was required 
which created delays in payment. 
……(para 13.08 (d) of the award) 
 
5). Respondent no.1 denies that there was delay 
in clearing payments to the claimant and asserts 
that all payments validly due to the claimant 
were made in time. Respondent no.1 asserts 
that: 
 (i) Invoices were submitted by the claimant 
later than the date on the face of the invoice; 
 
(ii) To compute the period in which payment 
of an invoice is to be made the start date is 
the date on which the invoice, complete with 
all supporting documents, is received by 
Respondent no.1 which must be after 
receipt of the relevant material at site; and 
 
(iii) In many cases, invoices were not 
accompanied by the required backup 
documents and the payment of the invoice 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 88 of 150 
 
 
could not be released until these backup 
documents were submitted by the claimant. 
……(para 13.08 (e) of the award) 
 
6). The tribunal accepts that delays by the 
Claimant in submitting its invoices, in providing 
the backup materials and in crediting payment 
to its account would be included in the times 
computed by the claimant between the date of 
the invoice and the date of payment as included 
in its tabulation of its invoices. However, 
examination of Exhibit C-21 indicates that for 
invoices paid before 12 November 2013, over 
90%, were paid in less than 50 days from the 
invoice date. Whereas, for invoices paid after 12 
November only about 30% were paid within 50 
days. Indeed, about 25% of the invoices dated 
after 12 November 2013 were not paid for 100 
days or longer. These percentages satisfy the 
tribunal that the introduction of payment by 
letter of credit, as it was arranged by Respondent 
no.1, was more onerous than could reasonably 
have been anticipated by the claimant when it 
entered into the contracts. 
…..(para 13.08 (g) of the award) 
 
7).  Respondent no.1 decided that the original 
design of the Hot well drain pump was 
unnecessarily large and changed the specified 
pump to a smaller pump on 21st November 
2013. As a result, both the pump and the electric 
motor, which was required to drive the pump, 
had to be re-ordered. The claimant asserts, and 
respondent no.1 does not deny, that the original 
pump and motor would have been delivered to 
site on or about 17th February 2014. 
……..(para 13.10 (a) of the award) 
 
8). 
It was agreed at the hearing in this 
arbitration that the actual delivery date of the 
motors (which arrived a few days after the pump) 
could be taken as on or about 7th May 2014. 
Thus, there was a delay of approximately 79 days 
in delivery. 
……(para 13.10 (b) of the award). 
 
9). 
On balance, the Tribunal is satisfied that 
the drain pump together with its motor, although 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 89 of 150 
 
 
a low value component, was a necessary part of 
the ACC unit and the decision by Respondent no. 
1 to replace it at a late stage risked delaying the 
project. The time elapsed between the original 
estimated delivery date, and the assumed actual 
delivery date was 79 days. 
…….(para 13.10 (e) of the award) 
 
10).  The tribunal finds the following facts to be 
significant: 
(i) The ACC unit could not be connected to 
the turbine generator flange until the 
turbine generator was in place to have the 
connection made. Thus, welding of the ACC 
unit to the turbine flange was dependent on 
both completion of the horizontal duct and 
pressure balancing bellows by the claimant 
and the installation of the turbine on behalf 
of Respondent no.1. 
 
(ii) 
The 
ACC 
unit 
could 
not 
be 
commissioned, nor could the PG test be 
conducted without a flow of turbine exhaust 
steam. The turbine must be operational to 
provide the necessary flow of exhaust 
steam. Thus, both commissioning and the 
PG test were dependent on both the ACC 
unit and the turbine being operational. 
 
(iii)  
Up until the claimant was ready to 
erect the first part of the horizontal duct 
there is no evidence that the claimant was 
delayed by any other construction activity 
on site. The claimant states that the vertical 
duct erection was completed on 15th July 
2014. The vertical duct should have been 
completed on 7th February 2014. Thus, the 
tribunal finds that at 15th July 2014 the 
claimant was 158 days behind its program 
which is not attributable to non-readiness 
of Respondent no.1. 
 
(iv) The tribunal is satisfied that steam 
flowing 
(steam 
blowing) 
was 
being 
conducted 
by 
the 
turbine 
generator 
contractor in early February 2015 which 
would have been likely to have prevented 
the welding of the duct to the turbine flange. 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 90 of 150 
 
 
This process also indicates that the turbine 
was not operational. 
 
(v) On the basis of Mr. Parasuram's 
evidence, the tribunal finds that the 
claimant had completed the connection 
between the horizontal duct and the turbine 
generator flange around February 2015 but 
that commissioning of the ACC unit did not 
start until April 2015. Mr. Parasuram 
attributes the delay between February and 
April 2015 to Respondent no.1’s other 
contractors having outstanding work. Thus, 
completion of the Hook-up as described in 
the L1 network Schedule which should have 
taken place on 14th March 2014 did not 
take place until mid- February 2015 by 
which time the ACC unit construction was 
about 343 days behind schedule. On the 
evidence presented to the tribunal it is not 
possible to apportion the further delay of 
about 158 days which occurred between 
15th July 2014 and mid- February 2015 
between slow progress by the claimant and 
hindrance to the claimant’s work by the 
ongoing turbine generator installation. 
However, the tribunal is satisfied that at 
least part of this delay was not attributable 
to the claimant. 
……..(para 13.13 (c) of the award) 
 
11). The tribunal now considers when, if at all, 
the ACC system was completed. There are three 
certificates which are referred to in the erection 
purchase order. These are: 
A certificate on competition of punch points; 
A Take Over Certificate of Equipment; and 
A certificate of competition of performance test. 
None of these certificates have been issued. 
 
 
………(para 13.13 (d) of the award) 
 
12). The 
only 
certificate 
issued 
by 
the 
respondents was dated 2nd March 2017. In 
separate 
correspondence, 
Respondent 
no.1 
stated that this certificate was issued for 
marketing purposes and did not absolve the 
claimant from its contractual obligation under 
the Purchase Orders. 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 91 of 150 
 
 
……..(para 13.13 (e) of the award) 
 
13). Notwithstanding the respondents’ caveat, 
the issuance by the respondents of the 2nd 
March 2017 certificate is considered significant 
by the tribunal. The respondents knew the 
purpose for which the certificate was required by 
the claimant and, if it did not believe in the 
veracity of what it was certifying, even for 
marketing 
purposes, 
then 
it 
behaved 
dishonestly. The tribunal has no basis for 
assuming that the respondents would have acted 
in such a dishonest manner and thus, concludes 
that the respondents must have believed that the 
ACC unit was operating satisfactorily when it 
issued that certificate. The certificate states that 
the ACC unit was operating satisfactorily from 
May 2015. However, the tribunal does not rely 
on this date as it was not material to the purpose 
for which the certificate was required and was 
the date included in the draft certificate provided 
by the claimant. 
……….(para 13.13 (f) of the award) 
 
14). The tribunal concludes that all the criteria 
for issuing all three of the certificates listed 
above would have to be met before the ACC unit 
could be certified to be operating satisfactorily. 
The last alleged defects notified by Respondent 
no.1 in 2015, which has been exhibited, is dated 
4th July 2015. (The fan assembly detached more 
than a year later, and that event could not have 
been the basis for withholding the relevant 
certificates through 2015). In its e-mail of 4th 
July 2015, Respondent no.1 notes gearbox 
defects but gave no details nor is the tribunal 
provided with any information about what 
action, if any, was taken in relation to the alleged 
gearbox defect. However, the tribunal is satisfied 
that on 4th July 2015 the ACC units were not yet 
in fit condition to merit the issue of the three 
relevant certificates. 
……….(para 13.13 (g) of the award) 
 
15). The first indication that the claimant 
thought it was ready for a performance 
guarantee test was in its e-mail dated 21st 
September 2015. There is no evidence to suggest

that both the certificate on completion of punch 
points and takeover certificate of equipment 
should not have been issued on or before 21st 
September 2015. In the absence of any evidence 
from Respondent no.1 that there were any 
remaining punch points or that the ACC system 
was not capable of being taken over, the tribunal 
finds that these certificates are deemed to have 
been issued on 21st September 2015 a delay 
from the planned date of 539 days.   
……(para 13.13 (h) of the award) 
 
16). Equally, there is no further indication that 
the ACC unit was not capable of passing the PG 
test on 21st September 2015. However, a PG test 
can only be deemed satisfactory if it is not 
carried out within 180 days of the issue of the 
taking over certificate. Accordingly, the PG test 
would be deemed to have been carried out 
satisfactorily only after a further 180 days had 
elapsed. Thus, the tribunal finds that the 
deemed achievement of Supplier’s liability in 
respect to Performance Guarantee Test pursuant 
to Clause 10.5 of Annexure A of the Erection 
Purchase Order only became effective on 19th 
March 2016. As the claimant was still requesting 
a PG test as late as 20th May 2016 the tribunal 
is satisfied that the deeming provisions apply 
and the ACC unit is deemed to have passed the 
PG test. The Erection Purchase Order states 
that, where the PG test is deemed to have been 
carried out, the respondents remained liable for 
the guaranteed performance during the 180 
days. However, it is silent on whether the deemed 
achievement of supplier’s liability in respect to 
Performance Guarantee test is retrospective to 
the date when the performance can be said to 
have been achieved. The tribunal finds that for 
the purposes of determining the delay caused by 
the failure to arrange a PG test it would be just 
to consider that the required performance was 
achieved on 21st September 2015 - the date on 
which the tribunal has found that the ACC unit 
was deemed to have been taken over.

17). Respondent no.1 did not issue the takeover 
certificate of equipment or a certificate of 
completion nor did it arrange a PG test. However, 
it has offered no evidence of any defects in the 
ACC unit that it has shown existed on 21st 
September 2015. Accordingly, the tribunal is 
satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that 
respondent no.1 delayed issuing the said 
certificates and the PG test because it was not in 
a position, due to other factors beyond the 
Claimant’s control, to properly commission the 
ACC unit. Therefore, the tribunal is satisfied that 
at 21st September 2015, Respondent no.1 had 
delayed completion by 539 days and the 
claimant is entitled to 539 days’ extension of 
time.

The tribunal finds that these delays are not

pump being changed would have occurred before 
mid-February 2014 when the tribunal found that 
the project was delayed by 158 days. Thus, the 
delay at that point for which the claimant was 
responsible was 158 days less 79 days allowed 
for the change of drain pump. Thus, the claimant 
was in culpable delay of 79 days in mid-
February. The delay in commissioning occurred 
after mid-February 2014. Thus, the total 
extension of time granted by the tribunal is 539 
days.

Relevant Article(s) of the Schedule to the Limitation 
Act, 1963 applicable to the claim 
    
 
88.  Having taken note of the relevant facts as well as 
material observations in the arbitral award, we shall now 
consider as to which Article, or Articles(s), if more than 
one is applicable, of the Schedule to the 1963 Act would 
apply to the claim(s) of Enexio. Notably, the claim was in 
respect of: (a) declaration qua invalidity of Debit note(s); 
(b) outstanding principal amount; and (c) interest. Insofar 
as relief qua declaration was concerned, it was found 
barred by time prescribed by Article 58, and there is no 
serious challenge to that finding.  As regards claim for the 
outstanding principal amount, it was a composite claim 
for the balance amount payable for supplies made and 
work done under the Supply Purchase Order and the 
Erection Purchase Order respectively, which was found 
within limitation.   
 
89. 
According to the appellant(s), Article 14 is 
applicable to the claim in respect of balance amount for 
the price of the goods supplied under the Supply Purchase 
Order; and Article 18 would apply to the claim for the work 
done under the Erection Purchase Order.  It is their case 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              
Page 95 of 150 
 
 
that if the project was to be completed by 31 March 2014, 
three years period should be counted from that date and, 
therefore, claim would be barred by limitation as on 2 May 
2019 i.e., the date of commencement of the arbitral 
proceeding.  
 
90. Per contra, Enexio’s case is that it is a composite 
contract for design, manufacture, supply, erection and 
commissioning of air-cooled condenser unit (ACC Unit) 
with auxiliaries for 160 MW Coal Based Thermal Power 
Plant (Project) at Gummidipoondi in the State of Tamil 
Nadu whereunder payments were to be made on pro rata 
basis, and final payment was to be made only on 
completion of the work, subject to issuance of relevant 
certificates.  The completion of work got delayed due to 
reasons beyond the control of Enexio, as held by the 
Tribunal, therefore, 539 days of extension, up to the 
deemed date of completion of the project i.e., 21 
September 2015, was granted.  In between, the contract 
was not repudiated by either party. Hence, the limitation 
period of three years would have to be counted from the 
date of completion of the work, that is, from 21 September 
2015. It is also their case that before expiry of the 
prescribed 
period 
of 
three 
years, 
a 
written 
acknowledgment of the outstanding amount was made 
vide minutes of the meeting dated 19 April 2018.

Page 96 of 150 
 
 
Therefore, by virtue of Section 1873 of the 1963 Act, a fresh 
period of three years would start from the date of 
acknowledgement, which got further extended, by virtue 
of the provisions of Section 1974 of the 1963 Act, on 
account of the offer made on 26 May 2018 to pay Rs. 3 
crores as full and final settlement of all dues. Hence, as 
on 2 May 2019, the claim was not barred by limitation. 
 
91. 
A plain reading of Article 14 of the Schedule to the 
1963 Act, which is pari materia Article 5275 of the First 
Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1908 (in short 1908 Act), 
would indicate that it applies where: (a) the suit/ claim is 
 
73 Section 18. Effect of acknowledgment in writing.— (1) Where, before the expiration of the prescribed 
period for a suit or application in respect of any property or right, an acknowledgement of liability in respect of 
such property or right has been made in writing signed by the party against whom such property or right is 
claimed, or by any person through whom he derives his title or liability, a fresh period of limitation shall be 
computed from the time when the acknowledgment was so signed. 
(2) Where the writing containing the acknowledgement is undated, oral evidence may be given of the time 
when it was signed; but subject to the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), oral evidence of 
its content shall not be received. 
 
Explanation.-- for the purposes of this section, -- 
(a) an acknowledgement may be sufficient though it omits to specify the exact nature of the 
property or right, or avers that the time for payment, delivery, performance or enjoyment has not yet 
come or is accompanied by a refusal to pay, deliver, perform or permit to enjoy, or is coupled with a 
claim to set off, or is addressed to a person other than a person entitled to the property or right; 
(b) the word ‘signed’ means signed either personally or by an agent duly authorized in this 
behalf; and 
(c) an application for the execution of a decree or order shall not be deemed to be an 
application in respect of any property or right. 
 
74 Section 19. Effect of payment on account of debt or of interest on legacy.--- Where payment on account of a 
debt or of interest on a legacy is made before the expiration of the prescribed period by the person liable to 
pay the debt or legacy or by his agent duly authorized in this behalf, a fresh period of limitation shall be 
computed from the time when the payment was made: 
 
Provided that, save in the case of payment of interest made before the 1st day of January, 1928, an 
acknowledgement of the payment appears in the handwriting of, or in writing signed by, the person making the 
payment. 
 
Explanation. — For the purposes of this section, -- 
(a) where mortgage land is in the possession of the mortgagee, the receipt of the rent or 
produce of such land shall be deemed to be a payment; 
 
 
(b) ‘debt’ does not include money payable under a decree or order of a court. 
75 See Footnote 83 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021

for the price of goods sold and delivered; and (b) no fixed 
period of credit is agreed upon. Whereas Article 18 of the 
Schedule, which is pari materia Article 5676 of the First 
Schedule of the 1908 Act, applies where: (a) the suit/claim 
is for the price of work done by the plaintiff/ claimant for 
the defendant at his request; and (b) no time has been 
fixed for payment.  Thus, where a suit is for goods supplied 
and work done by the plaintiff (a contractor) and the price 
of materials and the price of work is separately mentioned, 
and the time for payment is not fixed by the contract, 
Article 14 will apply to the former claim, and Article 18 to 
the latter. But where a claim is made for a specific sum of 
money as one indivisible claim on the contract, without 
mentioning any specific sum as being the price of goods or 
price of the work done, neither Article 14 nor Article 18 
will apply, but only Article 55, which provides for all 
actions ex contractu (i.e., based on a contract) not 
otherwise provided for, would apply77.  
 
92. 
Article 55, which is a combination of erstwhile 
Articles 11578 and 11679 of the First Schedule to the 1908 
Act, is a residuary Article in respect of all actions based 
on a contract not otherwise specially provided for. For the 
applicability of Article 55, four requirements should be

satisfied, namely, (1) the suit should be based on a 
contract; (2) there must be breach of the contract; (3) the 
suit should be for compensation; and (4) the suit should 
not be covered by any other Article specially providing for 
it.   
 
93. 
A breach of a contract may be by non-performance, 
or by repudiation or by both80. In Anson’s Law of Contract 
(29th Oxford Edition), under the heading ‘Forms of Breach 
Which Justify Discharge’, it is stated thus:  
 
“The right of a party to be treated as discharged 
from further performance may arise in any one 
of three ways: the other party to the contract (a) 
may renounce its liabilities under it; (b) may by 
its own act make it impossible to fulfil them, (c) 
may fail to perform what it has promised. Of 
these forms of breach, the first two may take 
place not only in the course of performance but 
also while the contract is still wholly executory 
i.e., before either party is entitled to demand a 
performance by the other of the other’s promise. 
In such a case the breach is usually termed an 
anticipatory breach. The last can only take place 
at or during the time for performance of the 
contract.”    
 
94. 
Thus, failure of a party to a contract in performing 
its obligation(s) thereunder could be considered a breach 
of contract for the purpose of bringing an action against it 
by the other party. In such an event, the other party can 
claim compensation or damages, or/ and, in certain cases, 
obtain specific performance.

95. 
The phrase ‘compensation for breach of contract’, 
as occurring in Article 55 of the Schedule to the 1963 Act, 
would comprehend also a claim for money due under a 
contract. ‘Compensation’ is a general term comprising any 
payment which a party would be entitled to claim on 
account of any loss or damage arising from a breach of a 
contract, and the expression has not been limited only to 
a claim for unliquidated damages. The expression is wide 
enough to include a claim for payment of a certain sum81.  
 
96. 
In Mahomed Ghasita v. Siraj-ud-Din and 
others82, the plaintiff was to supply Italian marble and 
other stone required for flooring and was also to do all the 
work necessary for constructing the floor. The plaintiff 
sued for the balance of the money due to him based on 
this contract and the plaint made no mention of the price 
of the materials as distinct from the price of the work. The 
matter came before a Full Bench of the then Lahore High 
Court. Before the Full Bench the question was, what 
Article of the Limitation Act, 1908 is applicable to the suit.  
Sir Shadi Lal C.J., as His Lordship then was, speaking for 
the Bench held: 
 
“The action brought by the plaintiff was for the 
recovery of the balance of the money due to him 
on the strength of the contract described above; 
 
81 See U. N. Mitra’s Law of Limitation and Prescription, Sixteenth Edition, Volume 2, at pages 1342 & 1343,

and the question for consideration is what article 
of the Limitation Act governs the claim. Our 
attention has been invited, in the first instance, 
to article 5283, which prescribes a period of three 
years (enlarged to six years by the Punjab Loans 
Limitation Act of 1904) for the recovery of the 
price of goods sold and delivered to the 
defendant; and also to article 5684, which lays 
down a period of three years for a suit to recover 
the price of work done by the plaintiff for the 
defendant. Now, as stated above, the plaintiff 
supplied not only the materials, but also the 
labour, and it is clear that neither of the 
aforesaid articles governs the suit in its entirety. 
It is, however, urged that the action comprises 
two claims, one for the price of the material 
supplied by the plaintiff, and the other relating 
to the price of the work done by him, and that 
these two claims should be dealt with separately, 
and that they are governed by article 52 and 
article 56, respectively. The rule of law is no 
doubt firmly established that a combination of 
several claims in one action does not deprive 
each claim of its specific character and 
description. The Code of Civil Procedure allows a 
plaintiff, in certain circumstances, to combine in 
one action two or more distinct and independent 
claims, and it is quite possible that one of the 
claims may be barred by limitation, and the 
other may be within time; though both of them 
arise out of one and the same cause of action. In 
a case of that description there is no reason why

the court should not apply to each claim the rule 
of limitation specially applicable thereto. It is 
nowhere laid down that only one article should 
govern the whole of the suit, though it may 
consist of several independent claims, and that 
the suit should not be split up into its component 
parts for the purpose of the law of limitation.  
 
The question, however, is whether the action as 
brought by the plaintiff can be treated as a 
combination of two distinct claims. Now, the 
plaint makes no mention of the price of the 
materials as distinct from the price of the work 
and contains no reference whatsoever to two 
claims. There is only one indivisible claim, and 
that is for the balance of the money due to the 
plaintiff on the basis of a contract, by which he 
was to be paid for everything supplied and done 
by him in connection with the flooring of the 
building at a comprehensive rate. The claim, as 
laid in the plaint is an indivisible one; it cannot 
be split up into two portions. We must, therefore, 
hold that it falls neither under article 52, nor 
under article 56. 
 
The learned advocate for the plaintiff contends 
that as neither of the above articles governs the 
claim, it should come within article 12085. The 
judgment in Radha Kishen v. Basant Lal, which 
is relied upon in support of this contention, no 
doubt, related to a suit for the recovery of a sum 
of money alleged to be due for the work 
performed and material supplied by the plaintiff 
to the defendant under a contract, and the 
learned judges held that neither article 52 nor 
article 56 was applicable to the entire claim. 
They then made the following observation –  
 
“There is no other articles specially 
applicable, and hence the only article 
which can be applied is article 120.”

Now with all deference to the learned judges we 
are unable to hold that there is no other article 
governing a claim of that character. It seems that 
their attention was not drawn to article 11586, 
which governs every suit for compensation for 
the breach of a contract not in writing registered 
and not specially provided for in the Limitation 
Act. It is beyond doubt that this article is a 
general provision applying to all actions ex 
contractu not specially provided for otherwise; 
and the present claim certainly arises out of a 
contract entered into between the parties. The 
word ‘compensation’ in article 115 as well as in 
article 11687 has the same meaning as it has in

Section 73. Compensation for loss or damage caused by breach of contract.--  When a contract has 
been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the 
contract, compensation for any loss or damage caused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual 
course of things from such breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, would be likely to 
result from the breach of it. 
 
Such compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason 
of the breach. 
 
Compensation for failure to discharge obligation resembling those created by contract.---  
 
When an obligation resembling those created by contract has been incurred and has not been 
discharged, any person injured by the failure to discharge it is entitled to receive the same compensation from 
the party in default, as if such person had contracted to discharge it and had broken his contract. 
 
Explanation.-- In estimating the loss or damage arising from a breach of contract, the means which

denotes a sum of money payable to a person on 
account of the loss or damage caused to him by 
the breach of a contract. It has been held, and 
we consider rightly, that a suit to recover a 
specified sum of money on a contract is a suit for 
compensation within articles 115 and 116 ---

We are accordingly of opinion that the present 
claim must be regarded as one for compensation 
for the breach of a contract, and that there is no 
special provision in the Act which governs the 
claim. It must, therefore, come under the general 
provision contained in article 115, which governs 
every action arising out of contract, not 
otherwise specially provided for.”

In Dhapia v. Dalla91 before a Full Bench of the 
Allahabad High Court the question was, what Article of the 
First Schedule to the 1908 Act would apply to a suit for 
recovery of a specified sum under a contract. In that suit, 
the plaintiff had made defendant(s) partner to one half of 
the fishery rights in the tank arising from a Theka, on the 
condition that they would pay him half the Theka money. 
The allegations made in the plaint showed that the 
defendant(s) had already worked out the Theka in respect 
of their share in it. As that suit was not filed within three 
years from the date of breach, it was dismissed by the trial 
court as barred by limitation by applying Article 11592 of 
the First Schedule to the 1908 Act. The plaintiff preferred

appeal, which was allowed on the finding that Article 12093 
of the First Schedule to the 1908 Act applied, whereunder 
the limitation was six years. When the matter travelled to 
the High Court, an argument was raised that neither 
Article 115 nor Article 120 could apply, rather Article 
11394 would apply.  It was contended before the High 
Court that Article 113 should apply as the claim is nothing 
but for specific performance. Rejecting this submission 
and holding that Article 115 of the First Schedule to 1908 
Act would apply, the Full Bench held: 
“8. In our opinion there is no force in this 
argument. It is true that there was a contract 
between the parties inasmuch as the plaintiff 
gave to the defendants one half of the fishery 
rights in the tank, on the condition that they 
would pay him half the theka money. The 
allegations made in the plaint show that the 
defendants had already worked out the theka in 
respect of their share in it. All that remained to 
be done was to pay the proportionate theka 
money to the plaintiff. In such circumstances no 
suit for specific performance of contract could be 
filed: only a suit to enforce the agreement so far 
as it related to the payment of the proportionate 
theka money could be, and has been filed. 
9. The relevant portion of section 12 of the 
Specific Relief Act (Act 1 of 1877) reads as 
follows: 
“… The specific performance of any 
contract may in the discretion of the 
court be enforced—

adequate relief, or

done……” 
10. A suit for the recovery of a specified sum 
under a contract cannot be said to be a suit of 
the nature where pecuniary compensation would 
not afford adequate relief. We are, therefore, of 
the opinion that the suit out of which this civil 
revision arises cannot be said to be a suit for the 
specific performance of a contract and will not be 
governed by Article 113 of the First Schedule to 
the Indian Limitation Act, 1908

13. We now proceed to consider why Article 115 
of the First Schedule to the Limitation Act should 
apply to the facts of the present case. Article 115 
applies when there is a breach of contract, and 
suit is for compensation for the loss suffered by 
the innocent party. A breach of contract ‘occurs 
where a party repudiates or fails to perform one 
or more of the obligations imposed upon him by 
the contract’: (vide Cheshire and Fifoot, p 484). 
‘If one of two parties to a contract breaks the 
obligation which the contract imposes, a new 
obligation will in every case arise – a right of 
action conferred upon the party injured by the 
breach’ (vide Anson’s Law of Contract, p 412). 
Admittedly, in the present case, there was a 
contract and according to the plaintiff and the 
findings of the court a breach of contract had 
occurred inasmuch as the defendants failed to 
pay the stipulated amount upon the date fixed 
under the contract. 
 
14. Difficulty can, however, be caused by the 
word ‘compensation’ used in Article 115. It can 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 106 of 150 
 
 
be argued that the words compensation for 
breach of contract point rather to a claim for 
unliquidated damages than to the payment of a 
certain sum, and, therefore, where the suit is for 
the recovery of a specified sum, and not for the 
determination of unliquidated damages, this 
article should not apply. In our opinion this 
contention would be wholly untenable because it 
was not accepted by this court in the Full Bench 
case of Hussain Ali Khan versus Hafiz Ali Khan95 
and by the Privy Council in the case of Tricomdas 
Coovarji Bhoja versus Sri Gopinath Jiu Thakur96. 
In the case of Husain Ali Khan Article 116 of 
Schedule II of the Limitation Act (Act XV of 1877) 
was the subject of interpretation. Articles 115 
and 116 of Schedule II of Act XV of 1877 have 
been 
reproduced 
verbatim 
in 
the 
Indian 
Limitation Act, 1908. Article 115 deals with the 
breach of contracts not in writing and registered 
while Article 116 provided for breach of contracts 
in writing and registered. It is, therefore, 
obvious, that the meaning which has to be given 
to the words ‘compensation for breach of 
contract’ occurring in both the Articles will have 
to be the same.

16. In the case of Tricomdas Cooverji Bhoja the 
argument that the words ‘compensation for 
breach of a contract’ point rather to a claim of 
unliquidated damages than to the claim of 
payment of certain sum was not accepted 
because the word compensation has been used 
in the Indian Contract Act in a very wide sense. 
17. The relevant portion of section 73 of the 
Indian Contract Act reads as follows: 
‘73. When a contract has been broken, 
the party who suffers by such breach is 
entitled to receive, from the party who 
has broken the contract, compensation 
for any loss or damage caused to him 
thereby, which naturally arose in the 
usual course of things from such breach, 
or which the parties knew, when they 
made the contract, to be likely to result 
from the breach of it.

Such compensation is not to be given for 
any remote and indirect loss or damage 
sustained by reason of the breach……

A contracts to pay a sum of money

ruined. A is not liable to make good to B 
anything except the principal sum he 
contracted to pay, together with interest 
up to the day of payment.’ 
 
18. It is, therefore, clear that the word compensation has 
been used, in section 73 of the Indian Contract Act in a 
very wide sense and the present case would be covered by 
it. 
19. We see no reason why the words ‘compensation for 
breach of contract’ as used in Article 115 should be given 
a meaning different from the same words as used in Article 
116. Article 115 being a residuary Article for suits based 
on breach of contract, it is obvious that the suit out of 
which this revision arises would be governed by the said 
Article.”

98. 
On a consideration of the aforesaid decisions as 
well as the provisions of Section 73 of the Contract Act and 
Article 55 of the Schedule to the 1963 Act, we are of the 
view that even a suit for recovery of a specified amount, 
based on a contract, is a suit for compensation, and if the 
suit is a consequence of defendant breaching the contract 
or not fulfilling its obligation(s) thereunder, the limitation 
for institution of such a suit would be covered by Article 
55 of the Schedule to the 1963 Act, provided the suit is 
not covered by any other Article specially providing for it.

In the instant case, there is no dispute that the 
claim is based on a contract. The finding of the Arbitral 
Tribunal in paragraph 13.13 (i)97 of the award is that the 
appellant(s) 
herein 
had 
failed 
to 
undertake 
the 
performance guarantee test, despite request of the 
claimant, within the period specified therefor.  The final 
payment of the bill(s) / invoice(s) was dependent on 
issuance of certificate(s) including one relating to 
successful completion of the performance guarantee test 
(PG Test). Further, the contract provided that if the 
performance guarantee is not undertaken by the 
purchaser (appellant(s) herein), it could be deemed that 
the supplier (claimant -R-1) had fulfilled its obligation of 
providing a guaranteed performance of the project under 
the contract. In these circumstances, when, despite 
request of the contractor /supplier, the employer/ 
purchaser failed to undertake the PG Test, the Arbitral 
Tribunal justifiably concluded that even though the 
supplier (claimant) had fulfilled its obligations under the 
contract, the purchaser (appellant(s) herein) had failed in 
fulfilling its obligation of making payment of the 
outstanding principal amount to the claimant, which had 
become due and payable under the contract.  In our view, 
therefore, the claim being one for ‘compensation’ (which 
term includes a specified outstanding amount), based on 
 
97 Extracted in paragraph 88 (16) of this judgment.

breach of a contract, the limitation for the claim would fall 
within the ambit of Article 55 of the Schedule to the 1963 
Act unless demonstrated that the claim is specially 
covered by any other Article of the Schedule.    
 
100. 
In Geo Miller (supra)98 a three-Judge Bench of 
this Court held that in a commercial dispute, though mere 
failure to pay may not give rise to a cause of action, once 
the applicant has asserted their claim and the respondent 
fails to respond to such claim, such failure will be treated 
as a denial of the applicant’s claim giving rise to a dispute 
and, therefore, a cause of action for reference to 
arbitration would come into existence.  It was also 
observed that it would not lie in the mouth of the claimant 
to plead that it waited to refer the dispute to arbitration 
because it was making representations and sending 
reminders to the respondent to settle the matter.

in 
the 
context 
of 
commencement of the period of limitation for making a 
reference application under Section 20 of the erstwhile 
Arbitration Act, 1940, it was held by this Court that to be 
entitled to have an order of reference under Section 20, it 
is necessary that there should be an arbitration agreement 
and secondly, differences must arise to which the

agreement applied. Once there is an assertion of claim by 
the appellant and silence as well as refusal in respect of 
the same by the respondent, a dispute would arise 
regarding non-payment of the alleged dues.  The Court 
thereafter went on to observe: 
“4. ……. The High Court proceeded on the basis 
that the work was completed in 1980 and 
therefore, the appellant became entitled to the 
payment from that date, and the cause of action 
under article 137 arose from that date. But in 
order to be entitled to ask for the reference under 
section 20 of the Act there must not only be an 
entitlement to money but there must be a 
difference, or dispute must arise. It is true that 
on completion of the work a right to get payment 
would normally arise but where the final bills as 
in this case have not been prepared as appears 
from the record and when the assertion of the 
claim was made on 28.2.1983 and there was 
non- payment, the cause of action arose from 
that date, that is to say, 28.2.1983. It is also true 
that a party cannot postpone the approval of 
cause of action by writing reminders or sending 
reminders but where the bill had not been finally 
prepared, the claim made by a claimant is the 
accrual of the cause of action. A dispute arises 
where there is a claim and a denial and 
repudiation of the claim. The existence of dispute 
is essential for appointment of an arbitrator 
under Section 8 or reference under section 20 of 
the Act.  There should be dispute and there can 
only be a dispute when a claim is asserted by one 
party and denied by the other on whatever 
grounds. Mere failure or inaction to pay does not 
lead to the inference of the existence of dispute. 
Dispute entails a positive element and assertion 
of denying, not merely inaction to accede to a 
claim or a request. Whether in a particular case 
a dispute has arisen or not has to be found out 
from the facts and circumstances of the case.” 
 
102. 
Interpreting the decision of this Court in Inder 
Singh Rekhi (supra), in B & TG AG (supra) it was, inter 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 111 of 150 
 
 
alia, held that three principles of law are discernible from 
the aforesaid decision: (1) ordinarily, on the completion of 
the work, the right to receive the payment begins; (2) a 
dispute arises when there is a claim on one side and its 
denial/ repudiation by the other; and (3) a person cannot 
postpone the accrual of cause of action by repeatedly 
writing letters, or sending reminders. In other words, 
bilateral discussions for an indefinite period would not 
save the situation so far as the accrual of cause of action 
and the right to apply for appointment of arbitrator is 
concerned.  
 
103. 
In the case in hand, the award reveals that in 
respect of payment of Claimant’s invoices, the Purchase 
Orders provided that 65% of the Order Price was to be paid 
on pro rata basis along with 100% taxes and duties after 
receipt of material at site, within 25 days of submission of 
Invoice/ request for payment, and other documents100. 
The award recites that there is no indication in the 
Purchase Orders as to what ‘other documents’ were 
required101. Not only that, payment, including balance 
payment, was dependent on issuance of: (i) certificate on 
completion of punch points signed by parties; (ii) take over 
certificate of equipment (to be issued by the Purchaser); 
and (iii) certificate of completion of performance test of

equipment (to be issued by the Purchaser)102. But none of 
these certificates was issued103. In these circumstances, 
the Arbitral Tribunal had to consider various facts and 
circumstances to come to a definite conclusion that the 
work was completed on 21 September 2015.  In holding 
so, Tribunal relied on: (a) an e-mail sent by the claimant 
on 21 September 2015 showing its readiness to a 
performance guarantee test; and (b) the fact that there was 
no evidence to suggest that the certificates on completion, 
as ought to have been issued, should not have been issued 
on or before 21 September 2015104.  The Tribunal also took 
note of the terms and conditions of the contract which 
were to the effect that the performance guarantee test can 
be deemed satisfactory if, despite request, it is not carried 
out within 180 days of the issue of the taking over 
certificate. The Tribunal noticed that vide certificate dated 
2 March 2017 the appellant(s) admitted that unit was 
commissioned in May 2015 and there was a request of the 
claimant dated 21 September 2015 to undertake 
performance guarantee test105.  Taking all of this into 
account, the Tribunal held that the “deemed achievement 
of supplier’s liability in respect to performance guarantee”, 
pursuant to clause 10.5 of Annexure A of the Erection 
Purchase Order, became effective on 19 March 2016106.

104. 
 From the discussion thus far, following dates 
emerge which, in our view, would be relevant for 
determining the start point of limitation for the claim: 
 
(a) 21 September 2015 i.e., the deemed 
date of completion of the supply/ work 
undertaken by the claimant under the 
Purchase Orders/ contract; and 
 
(b) 19 March 2016 i.e., the deemed date 
by which the supplier (Claimant) had fulfilled 
its liability under the contract relating to 
guaranteed 
performance 
of 
the 
Unit 
concerned. 
 
105. 
Now, we shall consider whether Articles 14 and 18 
of the Schedule to the 1963 Act were applicable or not.   
Article 14 applies where the suit is for the price of the 
goods sold and delivered, and there is no fixed period of 
credit agreed upon.  Here, there is an indivisible claim in 
respect of the outstanding principal amount for the goods 
supplied and the work done. Moreover, the payment(s) 
under the supply purchase order were to be on pro rata 
basis, and full payment for the supplies was dependent on 
supporting documents, including certificates, to be 
provided by the purchaser, which were not provided.  
Thus, when full payment(s) under the supply/erection 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 114 of 150 
 
 
purchase order(s) were dependent on certificates relating 
to completion/ commissioning /guaranteed performance 
etc., the claimant waited till successful completion / 
commissioning / guaranteed performance of the project to 
file a composite claim for the balance amount payable 
under both the purchase orders. In our view, therefore, 
Article 14 is not applicable to the claim as framed.  
 
106. 
Insofar as Article 18 is concerned, it is to apply 
where the suit is for the price of the work done by the 
plaintiff for the defendant at his request, and where no 
time has been fixed for payment.  In the instant case, there 
is an indivisible claim for the outstanding amount in 
respect of goods supplied and the work done. As already 
noticed above, the payment(s) under the contract were to 
be made on pro rata basis, dependent on work done and 
certificates issued, which, as per the finding in the award, 
were not issued.  Hence, the claimant was entitled to make 
a composite claim for the goods supplied and the work 
done after the project was successfully complete i.e., when 
the Unit was commissioned followed by guaranteed 
performance. Because it is only then, when the 
outstanding amount, as per the Bills / Invoices raised, 
became due and payable to the claimant in terms of the 
contract. Thus, in our view, Article 18 would also not 
apply.  
 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 115 of 150 
 
 
107. 
As it is not demonstrated that any other Article of 
the Schedule specially providing for the claim, as was 
made by R-1, was applicable, in our view, Article 55 of the 
Schedule was applicable to the claim, inter alia, for the 
following reasons: 
 
(a) The claim was for compensation 
(in as much as the term ‘compensation’ 
includes a specified amount payable 
under a contract107) in respect of the 
goods supplied and the work done under 
a contract; and 
 
(b) The claim was based on a breach 
of the contractual obligation as, according 
to the findings returned by the Arbitral 
Tribunal, the respondents to the claim 
(appellant(s) herein) had failed to fulfil 
their obligation(s) of making payment of 
the 
outstanding 
principal 
amount 
payable under the contract despite 
raising of bills / invoices by the claimant.  
  
Starting Point of Limitation for the Claim 
 
108. 
Having determined that limitation for the claim 
would be governed by Article 55 of the Schedule to the 
 
107 See our discussion in paragraphs 96 to 98 of this judgment  

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 116 of 150 
 
 
1963 Act, we shall now ascertain the date from which the 
limitation period is to be counted.   
 
109. 
Under Article 55, the limitation period begins to 
run when the contract is broken or where there are 
successive breaches, when the breach in respect of which 
the suit is instituted occurs, or where the breach is 
continuing, when it ceases.  
 
110. 
In the case in hand, it is nobody’s case that either 
party repudiated the contract.  Further, the claim is not in 
respect of non-payment of any specific bill or invoice 
during execution of the contract.  Rather, it is for the 
outstanding principal amount due to the claimant on 
discharge of his obligations under the contract. No doubt, 
list of unpaid bills / invoices was placed on record of the 
arbitral proceedings to demonstrate that bills / invoices 
were raised / issued, but the same was by way of evidence 
to support the claim, which was for the entire outstanding 
principal amount payable to the claimant on discharge of 
its obligations under the contract.  Thus, simply put, the 
cause of action for the claim in question is appellant(s)’ 
failure to make payment of the outstanding principal 
amount to the claimant despite discharge of contractual 
obligations by it.  
 
111. 
At this stage, we would like to put on record that 
nothing was brought to our notice that there was any fixed 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 117 of 150 
 
 
date, or period of credit, for payment of the balance 
amount.  In the above circumstances, in our view, the 
starting point of limitation should be the date when the 
claimant had fulfilled all its obligations under the contract 
and was entitled for release of the outstanding amount 
payable under the contract.   
 
112. 
As per the contract, if, after takeover, the 
purchaser (appellant(s) herein) fails to undertake the 
performance guarantee test, within 180 days from the date 
of request for it by the supplier (i.e., claimant), it is to be 
deemed that the supplier has fulfilled its liability in respect 
of the guaranteed performance. Apparently, passing the 
performance guarantee test was last of the supplier’s 
(claimant’s) obligations, whereafter the supplier was 
entitled for release of the balance amount. The Tribunal 
has found: (a) that as per certificate dated 2 March 2017, 
the commissioning took place in May 2015; (b) at that time 
there were certain technical issues, which were resolved 
later; (c) on 21 September 2015, claimant sent request to 
the appellant(s) to undertake performance guarantee test, 
but there was no response to the request; and (d) the 
period of 180 days, counted from 21 September 2015, 
expired on 19 March 2016.  In the light of the above 
findings, the Tribunal concluded that commissioning took 
place in the month of May 2015; technical issues were 
resolved by 21 September 2015; and performance 
guarantee period expired on 19 March 2016.

113. 
Based on the above, while bearing in mind that 
final payment of the principal outstanding amount was 
dependent on meeting the requirement of performance 
guarantee, in our view, the cause of action for the claim, 
as made, matured on expiry of that stipulated period of 
180 days within which, despite request, the appellant(s) 
(i.e., purchaser) failed to undertake the performance 
guarantee test.  Thus, even though there might be several 
bills/ invoices raised/issued by the claimant during 
execution of the contract, the claim of the claimant for the 
outstanding principal amount matured on expiry of 180 
days from the date of the notice given by the claimant to 
the appellant(s) (i.e., respondents to the claim) to 
undertake the performance guarantee test.   We, therefore, 
conclude that limitation for the claim started to run from 
19 March 2016.  
 
114.  
At this stage, we may notice, only to reject, an 
alternative submission made on behalf of the appellant, 
which is, that if Article 55 was applicable, the breach of 
the contract occurred when the claimant failed to 
complete the project by 31 March 2014, as promised, 
therefore, the period of limitation should be counted from 
that date.  This argument, in our view, is not sustainable, 
because time was not the essence of the contract in as 
much as there was a clause for liquidated damages for 
delay in completion (See Clause 13 of Annexure A of the 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 119 of 150 
 
 
Supply Purchase Order as extracted in paragraph 7.32 of 
the award). Moreover, there is no material on record to 
indicate that the contract was repudiated by the appellant 
on any date for non-completion of the project by the date 
stipulated. Rather, the materials on record, as recited in 
the award, indicate that parties continued to engage with 
each other and accepted performance of contractual 
obligations even beyond the stipulated date.  Further, 
there is a clear finding in the award that the claimant was 
entitled to extension of 539 days.  For the above reasons, 
we reject the alternative submission made on behalf of the 
appellant(s).      
 
Limitation Extended by Acknowledgement dated 
19.04.2018 under Section 18 of the 1963 Act  
 
115. 
As the limitation period of three years prescribed 
by Article 55, if counted from 19 March 2016, expired 
before the date of commencement of the arbitral 
proceeding (i.e., 2 May 2019), we will have to consider 
whether, by virtue of acknowledgment, if any, the claimant 
was entitled to extension of the period of limitation. 
 
116.  Section 18108 of the 1963 Act deals with the effect of 
acknowledgement in writing. Sub-section (1) thereof 
provides that where, before the expiration of the 
prescribed period for a suit or application in respect of any

right, an acknowledgement of liability in respect of such 
right has been made in writing signed by the party against 
whom such right is claimed, a fresh period of limitation 
shall 
be 
computed 
from 
the 
time 
when 
the 
acknowledgment was so signed. The Explanation to this 
section provides that an acknowledgment may be 
sufficient though it omits to specify the exact nature of the 
right or avers that the time for payment has not yet come 
or is accompanied by a refusal to pay, or is coupled with 
a claim to set off, or is addressed to a person other than a 
person entitled to the right.

In Khan Bahadur Shapoor Fredom Mazda v. 
Durga Prasad Chamaria and others109 while dealing with 
Section 19 of the 1908 Act, which is pari materia Section 
18 of the 1963 Act, this Court held that for a valid 
acknowledgement, under the provision, the essential 
requirements are: (a) it must be made before the relevant 
period of limitation has expired; (b) it must be in regard to 
the liability in respect of the right in question; and (c) it 
must be made in writing and must be signed by the party 
against whom such right is claimed. In paragraph 6 of the 
judgment, it was observed: 
“6. ….. The statement on which a plea of 
acknowledgement is based must relate to a 
present subsisting liability though the exact 
nature or the specific character of the said 
liability may not be indicated in words. Words 
used in the acknowledgment must, however,

indicate the existence of jural relationship 
between the parties such as that of debtor and 
creditor, and it must appear that the statement 
is made with the intention to admit such jural 
relationship. Such intention can be inferred by 
implication from the nature of the admission, 
and need not be expressed in words. If the 
statement is fairly clear then the intention to 
admit jural relationship may be implied from it. 
The admission in question need not be express 
but must be made in circumstances and in 
words from which the court can reasonably infer 
that the person making the admission intended 
to refer to a subsisting liability as at the date of 
the statement. In construing words used in the 
statements made in writing on which a plea of 
acknowledgment rests oral evidence has been 
expressly 
excluded 
but 
surrounding 
circumstances can always be considered. Stated 
generally courts lean in favor of a liberal 
construction of such statements though it does 
not mean that where no admission is made one 
should be inferred, or where a statement was 
made clearly without intending to admit the 
existence of jural relationship such intention 
could be fastened on the maker of the statement 
by an involved or far-fetched process of 
reasoning…… 
7. 
…… The effect of the words used in a 
particular document must inevitably depend 
upon the context in which the words are used 
and would always be conditioned by the tenor of 
the said document…….”

In J.C. Budhraja v. Chairman Orissa Mining 
Corporation Ltd. and Others110 , following the decision in 
Khan Bahadur Shapoor (supra), a three-Judge Bench of 
this Court held: 
“21. It is now well settled that a writing to be an 
acknowledgement of liability must involve an 
admission of a subsisting jural relationship 
between the parties and a conscious affirmation 
 
110 (2008) 2 SCC 444 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 122 of 150 
 
 
of an intention of continuing such relationship 
in regard to an existing liability. The admission 
need not be in regard to any precise amount nor 
by expressed words. If a defendant writes to the 
plaintiff requesting him to send his claim for 
verification and payment, it amounts to an 
acknowledgment. But if the defendant merely 
says, without admitting liability, it would like to 
examine the claim or the accounts, it may not 
amount to acknowledgment. In other words, a 
writing, to be treated as an acknowledgement of 
liability should consciously admit his liability to 
pay or admit his intention to pay the debt. Let us 
illustrate. If a creditor sends a demand notice 
demanding payment of Rs.1,00,000 due under a 
promissory note executed by the debtor and the 
debtor sends a reply stating that he would pay 
the amount due, without mentioning the 
amount, it will still be an acknowledgment of 
liability. If a writing is relied on as an 
acknowledgement for extending the period of 
limitation in respect of the amount or right 
claimed in the suit, the acknowledgement should 
necessarily be in respect of the subject matter of 
the suit. If a person executes a work and issues 
a demand letter making a claim for the amount 
due as per the final bill and the defendant agrees 
to verify the bill and pay the amount, the 
acknowledgement will save limitation for a suit 
for recovery of only such bill amount, but will not 
extend the limitation in regard to any fresh or 
additional claim for damages made in the suit, 
which was not a part of the bill or the demand 
letter. ……….. What can be acknowledged is a 
present 
subsisting 
liability. 
An 
acknowledgement made with reference to a 
liability, cannot extend limitation for a time-
barred liability or a claim that was not made at 
the time of acknowledgement or some other 
liability relating to other transactions. Any 
admission of jural relationship in regard to the 
ascertained sum due or a pending claim, cannot 
be an acknowledgment for a new additional 
claim for damages.

119. 
In the instant case, as found above, the limitation 
period started to run from 19 March 2016. Within three 
years therefrom, in the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 
2018111  there was a clear acknowledgement that the 
amount claimed by Enexio (as is there in the claim) is the 
balance amount payable, though subject to debit, by way 
of set off, against various claims made by the appellant(s) 
herein upon the claimant. In our view, such an 
acknowledgment is sufficient to extend the limitation 
period as it admits the existing liability of the appellant(s) 
qua the balance amount payable to the claimant under the 
contract. Benefit of such an acknowledgement would not 
be lost merely because a set off is claimed, inasmuch as 
clause (a) of the Explanation to Section 18, inter alia, 
provides that an acknowledgement for the purposes of this 
Section may be sufficient though it is accompanied by a 
refusal to pay, or is coupled with a claim to set off.  This 
would imply that, subject to fulfilment of other conditions 
of Section 18, once the defendant acknowledges that he 
owes a certain sum to the plaintiff there would be 
sufficient acknowledgment within the meaning of Section 
18, even though he states that he is entitled to set off 
against this sum another sum which the plaintiff owes 
him.  Thus, in our view, the minutes of meeting dated 19 
April 2018, though claims a set off, is a valid 
acknowledgement of the existing liability within the ambit

of Section 18 of the 1963 Act and it extends the period of 
limitation for a period of 3 years from the date it was made.  
In consequence, the claim of Enexio, made on 2 May 2019, 
was well within the period of limitation.  Sub-issue (b) is 
decided in the aforesaid terms.   
 
APPELLANT(S) COUNTERCLAIM IN RESPECT OF COST 
OF REPAIR/ REPLACEMENT OF GEAR BOX AND FAN 
MODULES BARRED BY TIME   
 
120. 
Now, we shall consider whether the counterclaim 
was barred by limitation. Before that, we must understand 
the true nature of a counterclaim.  A counterclaim is a 
claim made by a defendant in a suit against the plaintiff. 
It is a claim, independent of and separable from the 
plaintiff’s claim, which can be enforced by a cross action. 
Counterclaim preferred by the defendant in a suit is a 
cross suit and even if the suit is dismissed, counterclaim 
shall remain alive for adjudication. The purpose of the 
scheme relating to counterclaim is to avoid multiplicity of 
proceedings112.   
 
121. 
In Afcons Gunanusa JV (supra), after considering 
a plethora of precedents and authoritative texts, this 
Court summarized the legal principles relating to 
counterclaims, in the context of arbitral proceedings, as 
under:  
 
112 Rajni Rani v. Khairati Lal, (2015) 2 SCC 682, paragraph 9.6. 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 125 of 150 
 
 
“168. On our analysis of the statutory framework 
of the Arbitration Act and the CPC, related 
academic 
discourse 
and 
judicial 
pronouncements, 
the 
following 
conclusions 
emerge: 
(i) 
Claims 
and 
counter-claims 
are 
independent and distinct proceedings; 
(ii) 
A counter-claim is not a defense to 
a claim and its outcome is not contingent 
on the outcome of the claim; 
(iii) 
Counter-claims are independent 
claims which could have been raised in 
separate proceedings but are permitted 
to be raised in the same proceeding as a 
claim 
to 
avoid 
a 
multiplicity 
of 
proceedings; and 
(iv) 
the dismissal of proceedings in 
relation to the original claim does not 
affect the proceedings in relation to the 
counter-claim.” 
  
122. 
Section 23 (2A)113 of the 1996 Act gives respondent 
to a claim a right to submit a counterclaim or plead a set 
off, which shall be adjudicated upon by the arbitral 
tribunal, if such counterclaim or set off falls within the 
scope of the arbitration agreement.  Section 43 (1)114 of the 
1996 Act provides that the 1963 Act shall apply to 
arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in court.  Section 
3(2)(b)115 of the 1963 Act provides that any claim by way 
of set off or a counterclaim, shall be treated as a separate 
 
113 Section 23. Statement of claim and defence.— 
(1) ….. 
(2) ….. 
(2-A) The respondent, in support of his case, may also submit a counter-claim or plead set-off, 
which shall be adjudicated by the arbitral tribunal,  if such counter-claim or set-off falls within the 
scope of the arbitration agreement.

suit and shall be deemed to have been instituted – (i) in 
the case of a set off, on the same date as the suit in which 
the set off is pleaded; (ii) in the case of a counterclaim, on 
the date on which the counterclaim is made in court.  It is 
thus clear that a counterclaim is to be treated as a 
separate suit for the purposes of limitation and, to 
ascertain whether it is within limitation, the date of 
reckoning is the date when the counterclaim is filed and 
not when the claim/ suit is filed.   At this stage, it be noted 
that Section 21 of the 1996 Act is not relevant for 
determining the date of institution of a counterclaim as it 
is for a claim.  There is however one exception. Where the 
respondent against whom a claim is made, had also made 
a claim against the claimant and sought arbitration by 
serving a notice to the claimant but subsequently raises 
that claim as a counterclaim in the arbitration 
proceedings initiated by the claimant, instead of filing a 
separate application under Section 11 of the 1996 Act, the 
limitation for such counterclaim should be computed, as 
on the date of service of notice of such claim on the 
claimant and not on the date of filing of the 
counterclaim116. 
 
123. 
In Thomas Mathew v. KLDC Ltd.117 this Court, in 
the context of a claim referable to Article 55 of the 
Schedule to the 1963 Act, by relying on Section 3 (2)(b) of 
 
116 See State of Goa v. Praveen Enterprises, (2012) 12 SCC 581, paragraph 20; and Voltas Ltd. v. Rolta India Ltd., 
(2014) 4 SCC 516.

Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 127 of 150 
 
 
the 1963 Act, held that a counterclaim is required to be 
treated as a separate suit and the period of limitation 
would be three years from the date of accrual of the cause 
of action.   
 
124. 
It is therefore well settled that a counterclaim is 
like a cross suit, or a separate suit, and the limitation of a 
counterclaim is to be counted from the date of accrual of 
the cause of action which it seeks to espouse.  As a logical 
corollary thereof, it is quite possible that even though a 
suit or a claim is within the period of limitation, the 
counterclaim may well be barred by limitation, if the cause 
of action espoused therein accrued beyond the prescribed 
period of limitation. 
 
125. 
In the instant case, the counterclaims were for: (a) 
liquidated damages for the delay in supply and erection; 
(b) reimbursement of customs duties; (c) cost of erection 
of horizontal and vertical exhaust duct through an 
external agency; (d) cost of repair/ replacement of Gear 
Box, due to alleged defective supply; and (e) cost of repair/ 
replacement of Fan Modules, due to alleged defective 
supply.  Out of the above five counterclaims, three 
counterclaims, namely, (a), (b) and (c), were dealt by the 
Arbitral Tribunal on merits, as they stood recited in the 
minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018. Whereas the 
remaining two, namely, (d) and (e), were treated as barred 
by limitation because in respect thereof there was no 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 128 of 150 
 
 
recital / material to show that they were subject matter of 
negotiation between the parties. The counterclaim (a) (i.e., 
relating to liquidated damages for the delay) was rejected 
because the Tribunal found the claimant entitled to 
extension of time as the ACC Unit project envisaged Hook-
up / connection to the turbine generator flange which 
could took place only in February 2015 as turbine 
generator installation, which was being done by another 
contractor employed by OPG, got delayed118. The 
counterclaim (b) (i.e., reimbursement of customs duties) 
was rejected because, according to the Tribunal, as per the 
Supply Purchase Order, all Taxes, duties and levies were 
to be borne by the purchaser (appellant(s) herein)119.  
Insofar as counterclaim (c) was concerned, it was allowed 
and the counterclaimant was allowed set off in respect 
thereof.  The summary of how each of the counterclaims 
were dealt with, is found in paragraph 17 of the Award. 
 
126. 
We have, therefore, to consider whether the two 
counterclaims (d) and (e) were justifiably held time-barred 
or not.  More particularly, because claimant’s claim which 
arose out of same contract was found within limitation.   
 
127. 
Since counterclaim is to be treated as a separate 
suit or a cross-suit, its limitation would have to be 
determined independent of the claim, based on the cause 
 
118 See paragraphs 13.13 (c) and 13.15 of the Award, extracted in 88 (10) and 88 (19) above. 
119 Paragraph 14 of the Award.

of action espoused therein. Therefore, we would have to 
determine as to when the right to seek for the 
counterclaims (d) and (e) accrued.  In this context, while 
dealing with the previous issue i.e., regarding the claim 
being within limitation, we noticed a few dates which, in 
our view, would be helpful in determining the present 
issue.  These dates are: 
 
(a) May 
2015 
- 
when 
ACC 
Unit 
got 
commissioned and was operating satisfactorily, 
as per certificate dated 2 March 2017 issued by 
OPG. 
 
(b) 21 September 2015 – deemed date of takeover 
of the project i.e., when all alleged defects were 
removed by the claimant, and a request was 
made by the claimant to the purchaser 
(appellant(s) herein) to undertake performance 
guarantee test. 
 
(c) 19 March 2016 – when the period of 180 days 
of guaranteed performance expired. This date is 
important because, as per the contract, if, within 
the aforesaid period, the performance guarantee 
test is not undertaken, despite request of the 
supplier, it is to be deemed that the supplier has 
discharged 
its 
liability 
of 
a 
guaranteed 
performance of 180 days.    

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 130 of 150 
 
 
 
128. 
The Tribunal takes 21 September 2015 as the start 
point of limitation for the counterclaim on the premise that 
it would be the date when the Takeover Certificate is 
deemed to have been issued. That is, the supplier had 
fulfilled its obligations. On basis thereof, the Tribunal 
found counterclaims (d) and (e) barred by time as the 
counterclaim was filed on 15 July 2019 i.e., more than 
three years later, and there existed no acknowledgement 
in respect thereof.  
 
129. 
However, while dealing with the previous issue, we 
found 19 March 2016 as the start point of limitation for 
the claim because that is the date when 180 days period 
of guaranteed performance, which was part of supplier’s 
liability, expired.  Be that as it may, whether we count the 
limitation period from 21 September 2015 or 19 March 
2016, the counterclaim which was filed on 15 July 2019 
was beyond the prescribed period of three years inasmuch 
as its cause of action could not have arisen after 19 March 
2016 because by 19 March 2016, the supplier / contractor 
had fulfilled its obligation of guaranteed performance for 
180 days.  
 
Minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018 did not extend 
limitation of counterclaims (d) and (e) 
 
130. 
In these circumstances, the question that falls for 
our consideration is whether the minutes of meeting dated 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 131 of 150 
 
 
19 April 2018 extended the period of limitation for 
counterclaim(s)120 (d) and (e) as it did for the claim as well 
as counterclaims (a) (b) and (c).  The contention on behalf 
of the appellant(s) is that the claim and the counterclaim 
arose out of same contractual relationship, therefore, if 
the acknowledgment dated 19 April 2018 extends 
limitation of one part of the claim/ counterclaim, it would 
automatically extend limitation of the remaining part of 
the claim / counterclaim.  Per contra, learned counsel for 
Enexio (R-1) contended that there could be multiple claims 
arising out of the same contract, if the acknowledgment 
extending limitation under Section 18 of 1963 Act relates 
to only few, limitation for the rest would not get extended.  
Thus, the Tribunal committed no such error which may 
warrant interference under Section 34 of the 1996 Act. 
 
131. 
We have given our thoughtful consideration to the 
rival submissions. The minutes of meeting dated 19 April 
2018 was drawn within three years of accrual of the cause 
of action for the claim, whether we count limitation from 
19 March 2016 (as determined by us) or 21 September 
2015 (as determined by the Tribunal).  Therefore, the 
crucial question, which we must consider and decide, is 
whether those minutes could be considered as an 
acknowledgment of subsisting liability qua counterclaims 
(d) and (e).

and their corresponding value on which parties,

Interestingly, the balance amount payable to the 
contractor (Enexio - R-1) finds mention there and so does 
contractor’s liability towards liquidated damages, customs 
duty, dismantling – TG Building and ACC Duct 
fabrication, which have all been addressed on merits in 
the Award.  But, there is no mention of items referable to 
counterclaims (d) and (e), which have been held time 
barred.  Further, the minutes do not state that parties 
acknowledge, or are willing to settle, any other, or all their 
rights/ obligations, arising from, or under, the contract.  
Thus, the acknowledgment is specific and in respect of 
certain items only.   
 
133. 
In J.C. Budhraja (supra) this Court held that a 
writing to be an acknowledgement of liability must involve 
an admission of a subsisting jural relationship between 
the parties and conscious affirmation of an intention of 
continuing such relationship regarding existing liability. 
The Court added that the admission need not be in respect 
of any precise amount nor by expressed words. However, 
it was clarified that any admission of jural relationship in 
regard to a certain sum due, or a pending claim, cannot

be an acknowledgement for a new additional claim for 
damages122. That apart, in J.C. Budhraja (supra), this 
Court 
rejected 
an 
argument 
that 
if 
there 
was 
acknowledgment of any liability in regard to a contract, 
then one was at liberty to make any claim in regard to the 
contract. Relevant portion of the judgment is extracted 
below:  
“27. The appellant next contended, relying on 
Section 18 of the Limitation Act, that as there 
was acknowledgement of liability in regard to 
Contract no. 30/F-2 in the letter dated 28-10-
1978, and the notice invoking arbitration was 
issued on 4-6-1980 within three years from 28-
10-1978, he was at liberty to make any claim in 
regard to the contract before the arbitrator even 
though such claims had not been made earlier 
and all such claims have to be treated as being 
within the period of limitation. Such a contention 
cannot be countenanced. As noticed above, the 
cause of action arose on 14-4-1977. But for the 
acknowledgement on 28-10-1978, on the date of 
invoking arbitration 4-6-1980, the claims could 
have been barred by time as being beyond the 
period of limitation. The limitation is extended 
only in regard to the liability which was 
acknowledged in the letter dated 28-10-1978. It 
is not in dispute that either on 28-10-1978 or on 
4-3-1980, the contractor had not made the fresh 
claims aggregating to Rs.67,64,488 and the 
question of such claims made in future for the 
first time on 27-6-1986, being acknowledged by 
OMC on 28-10-1998 did not arise.”   
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
134. 
On the question of extension of limitation, where 
only a part of the liability, or a specific amount, is 
acknowledged during the period of limitation, there are 
long-standing decisions of various High Courts upholding 
 
122 See paragraph 21 of J.C. Budhraja (supra) extracted in paragraph 119 of this judgment.

the same principle as is discernible from the decision in 
J.C. Budhraja (supra). Some of these decisions are being 
noticed below.  
 
135. 
In Bans Gopal v. Mewa Ram123 in the context of 
applicability of Section 19 of the 1908 Act, which is pari 
materia Section 18 of the 1963 Act, the question before the 
Allahabad High Court was, whether a creditor could 
recover Rs.585 when acknowledgment was in respect of 
Rs.200 
only. 
One 
of 
the 
arguments 
was 
that 
acknowledgment of a sum of Rs.200 cannot be taken as 
an acknowledgment of a sum of Rs.585.  Accepting the 
argument, the Court held: 
“4. ….. It is true that if no definite sum had been 
mentioned 
and 
there 
had 
been 
an 
acknowledgement in general terms the amount 
of the debt would have been discovered from the 
evidence as mentioned in Explanation 1, Section 
19 of the Limitation Act. In the present case, 
however, there is a definite acknowledgement of 
Rs.200 and if this is to be used to save limitation, 
it could be done only with respect to the sum 
acknowledged, and not with respect to any sum 
that may be proved to be due on that date.”

136. In Kali Das Chaudhuri v. Drapaudi Sundari 
Dassi124  for the purpose of seeking the benefit of extension 
of limitation, the letter sought to be relied by the plaintiff 
as an acknowledgement made by solicitor of the defendant 
stated thus:

“Your client Babu Hari Prasad Saha was the 
gomoshta at Calcutta in the employ of the firm of 
Dwarka Nath Makhan Lal Saha, remunerated by 
a share of the profits, and being liable for a 
proportionate share of the losses. He was struck 
by paralysis in the Bengali year 1307, from 
which time he could not do active work. He, 
however, continued to be in Calcutta till 1311 
when he left Calcutta and went away to his home 
at Urapara. Our clients have all along been ready 
and willing to have the accounts duly taken up 
to this time that your client retired from 
Calcutta. Your client as the managing gomostha 
has to make up and explain the accounts up to 
that time. Our clients will offer every facility in 
the matter of the adjustment of accounts. ……  It 
is not the fact that your client retired on 27th 
June 1910. He ceased to do active work in 1307 
and retired in 1311. Our clients have no 
recollection of any notice from Messrs Dutta and 
Guha. Our clients are ready to pay to your client 
whatever may be found due on an adjustment of 
the accounts up to 1311.” 
 
Interpreting the aforesaid letter, in the context of 
plaintiff’s 
argument 
that 
it 
be 
treated 
as 
an 
acknowledgment of subsistence of relationship up to 27 
June 1910, the Calcutta High Court held: 
 
“Now, as I read that letter, that contains three 
material statements: it contains a statement that 
plaintiff was gomostha of the defendants; the 
second statement is that he was employed up to 
1311 (BS) (corresponding with 1904 - 1905], and 
no longer; and the third statement is that the 
defendants were willing and ready to pay to the 
plaintiff whatever might be found due to him on 
an adjustment of the accounts up to 1311. Now, 
what is the claim of the plaintiff in this case? He 
brought his suit in order to establish his right to 
have the accounts taken upon the basis that he 
was a partner, and that he was entitled to have 
the accounts taken down to June 1910. The

defendants’ solicitors wrote that he was not a 
partner and that he was not entitled to have the 
accounts taken up to 1910, but that he was only 
entitled to have the accounts up to 1311 (BS) 
(corresponding with 1904 – 1905). I cannot 
understand how that can be taken to be an 
acknowledgement of the right which the plaintiff 
was endeavoring to substantiate in his plaint. I 
can understand it being said and argued with 
considerable 
force 
that 
it 
was 
an 
acknowledgement of some part of the plaintiffs 
claim, inasmuch as his claim was to have the 
accounts taken up to June 1910, and inasmuch 
as the defendants admitted that he was entitled 
to have the accounts taken up to 1904 - 1905: to 
that extent it is an acknowledgment, but in my 
judgment it is not an acknowledgement of the 
right alleged by the plaintiff, namely, that he was 
entitled to have the accounts taking up to June 
1910.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
   
      
137. Having considered the judicial precedents on the 
subject, in our view, to extend the period of limitation with 
the aid of Section 18, the acknowledgment must involve 
an admission of a subsisting jural relationship between 
the parties and a conscious affirmation of an intention of 
continuing such relationship regarding an existing 
liability. Such intention can be gathered from the nature 
of the admission. In other words, the admission in 
question need not be express, or regarding a precise 
amount, but must be made in circumstances and in words 
from which the court can reasonably infer that the person 
making the admission intended to refer to a subsisting 
liability as on the date of the statement.  However, where 
an acknowledgement is in respect of a specified sum of 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 137 of 150 
 
 
money or a specific right only, and not in general terms, it 
would extend the period of limitation only in respect 
thereof, and not of other claims which, though may have 
arisen out of same jural relationship, are not specified 
therein. In other words, where an acknowledgement of 
liability is made only with reference to a portion of the 
claim put forward by the plaintiff/ claimant, it would 
extend limitation only in respect of such portion, and not 
of the entire claim of the plaintiff.    
 
138. 
Reverting to the case in hand, the minutes of 
meeting dated 19 April 2018 made no reference to the 
items referable to counterclaims (d) and (e). There is also 
no acknowledgment in general terms in regard to liabilities 
subsisting under the contract.  Therefore, in our view, the 
said minutes could not be treated as an acknowledgment 
for the purpose of extending limitation of counterclaims 
(d) and (e), which were not specified therein. In 
consequence, when counterclaims (d) and (e) were 
otherwise barred by limitation on the date of filing of 
counterclaim, the Tribunal was legally justified in 
rejecting them as barred by limitation.  Sub-issue (c) is 
decided in the aforesaid terms.

REJECTION OF PRAYER TO DECLARE DEBIT NOTES 
INVALID DID NOT AFFECT ENEXIO’S CLAIM FOR THE  
OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. 
 
139. 
We shall now consider whether rejection of 
Enexio’s prayer to declare debit notes invalid, had 
adversely affected the claim for the outstanding principal 
amount in respect of the goods supplied/ work done under 
the contract. In this regard, at the outset, we must bear in 
mind that it is trite that limitation bars the remedy but 
does not extinguish the right, save in a case which is 
covered by Section 27 of the 1963 Act125. It is equally 
settled that in a suit or a claim, multiple reliefs may be 
claimed by virtue of Order II Rule 3 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908126 , that is, the plaintiff may unite in the 
same suit several causes of action against the same 
defendant(s). The period of limitation is prescribed by the 
Schedule to the 1963 Act127.  The Schedule to the 1963 
Act is divided into three Divisions. The First Division, 
which deals with suits, is relevant for the purposes of this 
case inasmuch as by virtue of Section 43 (1) of the 1996 
Act the provisions of the 1963 Act apply to arbitrations as 
they apply to proceedings in Court.  The First Division of 
the Schedule comprises of ten (X) Parts.  Each Part deals

126 Order II Rule 3, CPC.— Joinder of causes of action.— (1) Save as otherwise provided, a plaintiff may unite in 
the same suit several causes of action against the same defendant, or the same defendants jointly; and any 
plaintiffs having causes of action in which they are jointly interested against the same defendant or the same 
defendants jointly may unite such causes of action in the same suit. 
 
(2) Where causes of action are united, the jurisdiction of the Court as regards the suit shall depend on 
the amount or value of the aggregate subject-matter at the date of instituting the suit.    
127 See Section 2(j) of the Limitation Act, 1963. 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 139 of 150 
 
 
with suit(s) of a different nature.  The period of limitation, 
including its start point, is dependent on its nature as well 
as event, if any, as specified in the Article(s) of the 
Schedule. Therefore, when CPC, in certain circumstances, 
permits combining in one action two or more distinct and 
independent claims, it is quite possible that one of the 
claims may be barred by limitation and the other may be 
within time128.   
 
140. 
In the instant case, as already held, the claim for 
compensation i.e., recovery of outstanding principal 
amount was covered by Article 55 of the Schedule and the 
start point of limitation was 19 March 2016; whereas for 
the relief of declaration, Article 58 was applicable. For 
which, the start point of limitation was the date when the 
debit note was communicated to Enexio i.e., the claimant. 
According to the arbitral tribunal, one debit note was 
issued on 24 August 2015, which was acknowledged by 
the claimant vide letter dated 28 August 2015, and the 
other was issued on 12 January 2016.  Therefore, the 
period of limitation i.e., three years expired before 2 May 
2019, that is, when request for arbitration was received by 
ICC Secretariat. In these circumstances, the relief for 
declaratory relief was held barred by limitation, and 
rightly so, by the arbitral tribunal. 
 
 
128 See Mohamed Ghasita v. Siraj-ud-Din and Ors. (supra), extracted in paragraph 97 of this judgment.  

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 140 of 150 
 
 
141. 
Now, the question is whether rejection of 
declaratory relief impacted the relief for compensation. 
Answer to it, in our view, is obviously no.  The reason is 
that the relief for compensation was not a consequential 
relief i.e., dependent on debit note(s) being declared invalid 
because issuance of debit note(s) was a unilateral act of 
the employer which on its own did not extinguish the right 
of the contractor.  No doubt, where the relief sought is 
consequential to the declaration, and declaratory relief is 
found barred by time, the prayer for consequential relief 
will also fail129.  But where declaration is just an optional 
relief i.e., on which the main relief is not dependent, 
rejection of it as barred by limitation would not extinguish 
the claim in respect of which substantive relief is sought. 
In the instant case, debit note was unilaterally issued by 
the employer of the contractor. It, therefore, did not bind 
the contractor.  In such circumstances, it was open for the 
contractor to sue for its dues without seeking a declaration 
qua the debit notes.  Consequently, rejection of the 
declaratory relief as barred by limitation, in our 
considered view, did not have a material bearing on 
Enexio’s claim against the appellant(s) herein for the 
outstanding principal amount payable under the contract. 
And, further, that amount, as shown debited in the debit 
note(s), was not to be automatically adjusted against the 
principal outstanding amount payable to Enexio. In our

view, while deciding the claim of Enexio, the arbitral 
tribunal was well within its remit to adjudicate upon the 
issue whether such amount should be adjusted or not 
against the outstanding principal amount payable to 
Enexio.  For the reasons aforesaid, there is no perversity 
in the award on this count.  Sub-issue (d) is decided 
accordingly. 
 
THE 
ARBITRAL 
TRIBUNAL 
DID 
NOT 
ADOPT 
DIFFERENT YARDSTICK / REASONING OF THE 
ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL IS NOT FLAWED OR PERVERSE  
 
142.  The next argument on behalf of the appellant(s) is 
that the arbitral tribunal adopted different yardstick for 
adjudicating the claim than what was adopted for the 
counterclaim; and the reasoning is completely flawed and 
perverse. By referring to paragraphs 16.03 (d)130 and 
16.04131 of the award it was submitted: 
 
(a) If negotiations could extend limitation for 
the claim, it would extend limitation for the 
counterclaim as well, because both arise from 
same contractual relationship.  Moreover, it is 
well settled that negotiations by themselves 
do not extend limitation as held by this Court 
in Geo Miller (supra) and B & T AG (supra). 
 
 
130 See paragraph 15 of this judgment wherein paragraph 16.03(d) of the award has been extracted. 
131 See paragraph 16 of this judgment wherein paragraph 16.04 of the award has been extracted. 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 142 of 150 
 
 
(b) If the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 
2018 could be relied on to hold that 
appellant(s) had admitted their liability qua 
the claim for the outstanding principal 
amount, it ought to have been relied also for 
upholding Enexio’s liability qua liquidated 
damages for delay and customs duty. 
 
143. 
At first blush, the above arguments appear 
attractive, but, when we test them by reading the award 
in its entirety, we find that the tribunal did not reject the 
counterclaims qua liquidated damages and custom duties 
as barred by limitation. Rather, rejected them on merit. 
Liquidated damages were denied because Enexio was 
entitled to 539 days extension for completion; and 
customs duties were found payable by the purchaser. The 
findings thereon are based on construction of the terms of 
the contract with reference to the conduct of the parties, 
therefore, it does not call for interference under Section 34 
of the 1996 Act.  
 
144. 
As far as extension of limitation by negotiation is 
concerned, a careful look at paragraph 16.03(d) of the 
arbitral award would indicate that there is a reference to 
two more aspects, ‘apart from meaningful negotiations’, to 
conclude that limitation for the claim was saved. These 
are: (a) the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018; and 
(b) the written offer of OPG (respondent(s) to the claim) 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 143 of 150 
 
 
dated 26 May 2018 to settle the matter. We have already 
found, while deciding sub-issues (b) and (c), that the 
minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018 tantamounted to 
an acknowledgment under Section 18 of the 1963 Act qua 
the items mentioned therein. We also noticed that it 
carried no mention regarding those items on which 
counterclaims were based, and therefore, they were 
rejected as barred by limitation. In these circumstances, 
though paragraph 16.03(d) of the award gives the 
impression 
that 
limitation 
was 
extended 
because 
negotiations were ongoing in respect of items related to the 
claim, the limitation was extended by applying the 
principle of acknowledgment as enshrined in Section 18 of 
the 1963 Act on basis of two documents i.e., the minutes 
of meeting dated 19 April 2018; and the offer letter dated 
26 May 2018. Importantly, the principle of extension of 
limitation by acknowledgement was applied in respect of 
only those claims regarding which a mention was there in 
the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018. In respect of 
claims regarding which there was no recital in the 
minutes, the tribunal observed that they were not part of 
the negotiations.  Thus, though the term used in 
paragraph 16.03(d) of the award is ‘negotiation(s)’, the 
tribunal, by referring to minutes dated 19 April 2018 and 
settlement offer dated 26 May 2018, indicated the 
underlying 
legal 
principle 
/ 
rationale 
behind 
its 
conclusion. We, therefore, conclude that though reasons 
recorded in the award at first blush appear insufficient, or 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 144 of 150 
 
 
a bit confusing, but, when those reasons are examined in 
the context of the documents placed and the arguments 
advanced, the underlying reasons, which form basis of the 
conclusion, are not only intelligible but sound.  For the 
aforesaid reasons and in the light of the law expounded in 
paragraph 71.6 above, we reject the submission of the 
appellant(s)’ counsel that the reasoning of the arbitral 
tribunal is flawed/perverse or that the award is vitiated by 
adopting different yardstick for adjudging the claim than 
what was adopted for the counterclaim. Even otherwise, 
the mistake, if any, committed by the arbitral tribunal in 
using the words ‘ongoing negotiations’ in place of 
acknowledgement is trivial does not go to the root of the 
matter as to have a material bearing on the conclusion. 
Therefore, for this mistake alone, the award is not liable 
to be set aside.    
 
145. 
The other submission on behalf of the appellant 
that the arbitral tribunal was obliged to accept the 
admission contained in the minutes of meeting dated 19 
April 2018 qua liquidated damages and customs duties, 
because it relied on it for extending the limitation, is 
equally unacceptable. Reason being that acknowledgment 
is just a piece of evidence, like an admission. An admission 
can always be explained. Therefore, even if it is used for 
extending the limitation, it cannot be regarded as 
conclusive proof of either the claim or the counterclaim 
regarding which there is an acknowledgement. Because 

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 145 of 150 
 
 
the Court or the Tribunal would have to decide the claim 
or 
the 
counterclaim, 
if 
within 
limitation, 
upon 
consideration of the entire evidence led before it. No doubt, 
in that process, the acknowledgement would also have to 
be considered as a piece of evidence.  Thus, in our view, 
the tribunal was well within its jurisdiction in drawing a 
conclusion, based on consideration of the entire evidence, 
at variance with the recitals in the acknowledgement.   
 
146. 
Otherwise also, as is clear from the award, the 
claimant had challenged the recital in the minutes i.e., 
regarding its liability for liquidated damages and customs 
duties, by claiming that it was economically coerced into 
making such admission. Circumstances, proven on 
record, indicated that (a) soon after the meeting dated 19 
April 2018, the claimant had sent a denial of its liability; 
and (b) later, on 26 May 2018, the appellant(s) herein had 
made an offer of Rs.3 crores to Enexio towards full and 
final settlement of all its claim.  In these circumstances, 
based on the evidence led by the parties, the tribunal was 
well within its remit to conclude that the claimant was not 
liable in respect of those items which formed part of the 
counterclaim. Such conclusion, which is based on proven 
circumstances, is a plausible view and cannot be termed 
perverse. Hence, it is not amenable to interference in a 
challenge under Section 34 of the 1996 Act.  In our view, 
therefore, the learned Single Judge of the High Court erred 
in law while interfering with the arbitral award.    

 
 
Civil Appeal @ SLP (C) Nos.21017-21018 of 2021                                              Page 146 of 150 
 
 
 
147. 
Before closing discussion on the issue, it would be 
necessary to address an alternative submission raised on 
behalf of the appellants. It was argued that the learned 
Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court, 
admittedly, were exercising jurisdiction under Sections 34 
and 37, respectively, of the 1996 Act.  As, while exercising 
jurisdiction under Section 34, the Court does not sit in 
appeal over the award, it cannot substitute the reasoning 
in the award with its own.  Likewise, the appellate court 
exercising power under Section 37 cannot have greater 
power than what a Court possesses under Section 34. 
Consequently, it was argued, the appellate court (i.e., the 
Division Bench of the High Court) exceeded its jurisdiction 
while providing its own reasons to support the conclusion 
in the award. It was also urged that in absence of proper 
reasons in the award, the only course available was to set 
aside the award with liberty to the parties to undertake 
fresh arbitration.  
 
148. 
We have given due consideration to the above 
submission.  In our view, a distinction would have to be 
drawn between an arbitral award where reasons are either 
lacking/unintelligible or perverse and an arbitral award 
where reasons are there but appear inadequate or

or inadequate, if, on a careful reading of the entire award, 
coupled with documents recited/ relied therein, the 
underlying reason, factual or legal, that forms the basis of 
the award, is discernible/ intelligible, and the same 
exhibits no perversity, the Court need not set aside the 
award while exercising powers under Section 34 or Section 
37 of the 1996 Act, rather it may explain the existence of 
that underlying reason while dealing with a challenge laid 
to the award. In doing so, the Court does not supplant the 
reasons of the arbitral tribunal but only explains it for a 
better and clearer understanding of the award.

In the instant case, the appellate court took pains, 
and rightly so, to understand and explain the underlying 
reason on which the claim of Enexio was found within 
limitation. As noticed above, paragraph 16.03 (d) of the 
award contains the reason based on which the arbitral 
tribunal concluded that Enexio’s claim was within 
limitation.  However, in paragraph 16.03 (d), the arbitral 
tribunal failed to state, in so many words, that it was 
treating the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018 as an 
acknowledgment within the meaning of Section 18 of the 
1963 Act. This omission on the part of the arbitral tribunal 
was trivial and did not travel to the root of the award, 
therefore, in our view, the appellate court was well within 
its jurisdiction to explain the underlying legal principle 
which the arbitral tribunal had applied; and in doing so, 
it did not supplant the reasons provided in the award.  In

this view of the matter, the impugned order of the Division 
Bench does not suffer from any legal infirmity.  Sub-issue

SUMMARY OF OUR CONCLUSIONS    
 
150. 
In the light of the analysis above, we summarize 
our conclusions as follows: 
 
(i) Though the ACC Unit /project was of OPG, 
Gita Power, as the holding company of OPG, 
had actively participated in the formation of the 
contract for the project.  Not only did it place 
purchase order(s) on Enexio but made advance 
payment(s) thereunder to Enexio, which were 
subsequently affirmed by OPG. The two, 
therefore, not only acted as a single economic 
entity but as agents of each other. Hence, the 
arbitral tribunal was justified in holding that 
Gita Power was bound by the arbitration 
agreement and jointly and severally liable 
along with OPG to pay the awarded amount. 
 
(ii) The claim of Enexio was an indivisible claim 
for compensation in lieu of goods supplied, and 
work done, based on breach of the contract, 
therefore limitation for the claim was governed

by Article 55, and not by Articles 14, 18 and 
113, of the Schedule to the 1963 Act. 
 
(iii) 
The claimant’s claim for the outstanding 
principal amount matured on 19 March 2016.  
Therefore, limitation started to run from that 
date. However, even if we count limitation from 
21 September 2015 (as found by the Tribunal) 
it will have no material bearing on the award 
for the reason indicated below.  
     
(iv) The limitation for the claim as well as 
counterclaim(s), other than those relating to 
cost of repair/replacement of gear boxes and 
fan modules, stood extended, under Section 18 
of 
the 
1963 
Act, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
acknowledgement made in the minutes of 
meeting dated 19 April 2018, and, therefore, 
those were within limitation as on the date of : 
(a) commencement of arbitration (i.e. 2 May 
2019); and (b) the date of filing counterclaim 
(i.e. 15 July 2019) and were rightly considered 
on merit. 
 
(v) 
The counterclaims qua cost of repair 
/replacement of gear boxes and fan modules 
were rightly held barred by time as in respect 
thereof there was no recital in the minutes of 
meeting dated 19 April 2018.

(vi) 
Rejection of prayer to declare debit notes 
invalid, on ground of limitation, had no adverse 
impact 
on 
the 
claimant’s 
claim 
for 
compensation, which was well within the 
extended period of limitation.     
        
151. 
Based on our conclusions above, we are of the view 
that there is no palpable error in the arbitral award as to 
be termed ‘patently illegal’ / ‘perverse’, or in conflict with 
public policy of India.  Therefore, the Division Bench of the 
High Court was justified in setting aside the judgment and 
order of the Single Judge and restoring the arbitral award. 
Accordingly, the appeal(s) fail and are hereby dismissed.
