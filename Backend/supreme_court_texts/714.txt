1. The present appeal arises from the judgment and 
order dated 25.10.2013 passed by the High Court of 
Orissa at Cuttack in First Appeal No. 185 of 1997, 
wherein the High Court reversed the judgment of the 
Civil Judge (Senior Division), Baripada, dated 
17.05.1997 in T.S. No. 103 of 1994. The High Court 
decreed the suit for specific performance filed by the 
plaintiffs (Respondent Nos. 1 & 2 herein), directing 
the defendants, including the present appellants 
(Defendant Nos. 9 to 11), to execute a sale deed in 
favour of the plaintiffs. Aggrieved by this decision, the

defendant nos. 9 to 11 have approached this Court 
by way of the present appeal.  
2. The relevant facts giving rise to the original suit are 
as follows: 
2.1. Late Surendranath Banerjee was the original 
owner of the suit property situated in Baripada, 
Odisha. Upon his demise on 03.07.1980, the 
property devolved equally among his five heirs: 
two 
sons—Defendant 
No. 
1 
(Binayendra 
Banerjee) and late Soumendra Nath Banerjee—
and three daughters—Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 
(Smt. Rekha Mukherjee, Smt. Sikha Das, and 
Smt. Monila Pal).  
2.2. On 14.04.1993, an oral agreement was entered 
into between all the co-owners (Defendant Nos. 
1 to 8) and the appellants (Defendant Nos. 9 to 
11), wherein the co-owners collectively agreed to 
sell the suit property to the appellants for a total 
consideration of ₹4,20,000. This agreement was 
the culmination of mutual discussions and a 
longstanding 
understanding 
between 
the 
parties, reflecting the genuine intent of all co-
owners 
to 
transfer 
the 
property 
to 
the 
appellants. 

Page 3 of 26 
 
2.3. Meanwhile, 
on 
06.06.1993, 
the 
plaintiffs 
(Respondent Nos. 1 & 2), who are dealers 
operating a petrol pump on the suit land under 
a dealership agreement with Defendant No. 12 
(Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited), 
allegedly entered into an agreement to sell with 
Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra for the 
purchase of the suit property for a total 
consideration of ₹5,70,000 paying ₹70,000 as 
earnest money. The agreement stipulated that 
the sisters (Defendant Nos. 6 to 8) would come 
to Baripada within three months to execute the 
sale deed, as they were unable to do so at the 
time of the agreement. As per the terms of the 
agreement, the sale deed was to be executed 
before 30.09.1993. 
2.4. It is pertinent to note that the agreement dated 
06.06.1993 was executed solely by Defendant 
No. 1 and late Soumendra, without any 
signatures, 
written 
consent, 
or 
explicit 
authorization from Defendant Nos. 6 to 8, who 
collectively held a significant 3/5th share in the 
property. The plaintiffs were aware that without 
the participation and consent of the sisters, a 

Page 4 of 26 
 
valid and enforceable sale could not be 
completed. 
2.5. The alleged authority of Defendant No. 1 to act 
on behalf of his sisters was based on an 
unregistered General Power of Attorney (GPA) 
dated 30.12.1982. However, this GPA was 
limited 
in 
scope, 
primarily 
authorizing 
Defendant No. 1 to manage certain aspects of 
the property, such as collecting rent. Moreover, 
the GPA was effectively revoked by a registered 
partition deed dated 17.02.1988, wherein the 
co-owners 
partitioned 
the 
property 
and 
specifically limited Defendant No. 1's authority 
to collection of rent, with no mention of any 
power to sell the property on behalf of the 
sisters. 
2.6. In fulfilment of the prior oral agreement dated 
14.04.1993, 
and 
after 
ensuring 
the 
participation and consent of all co-owners, 
Defendant 
No. 
1, 
late 
Soumendra, 
and 
Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 executed a registered sale 
deed on 27.09.1993 in favor of the appellants 
(Defendant Nos. 9 to 11) for a consideration of 
₹4,20,000. The appellants who are bona fide 

Page 5 of 26 
 
purchasers, acted in good faith and completed 
the transaction with all the five rightful owners, 
and accordingly acquired valid title to the 
property. 
2.7. The plaintiffs (Respondent Nos. 1 & 2), despite 
being aware of the necessity of obtaining 
consent from Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 and the 
limitations of Defendant No. 1's authority, filed 
T.S. No. 103 of 1994 before the Civil Judge 
(Senior 
Division), 
Baripada. 
They 
sought 
specific performance of the alleged agreement 
dated 06.06.1993 or, in the alternative, specific 
performance to the extent of the shares of 
Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra. The 
plaintiffs, as dealers operating on the suit land, 
aimed to secure ownership of the property to 
further their commercial interests.  
3. Before the Trial Court, the plaintiffs contended that 
they had entered into a valid and enforceable 
agreement to purchase the suit property from 
Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra on 06.06.1993 
for a total consideration of ₹5,70,000, paying ₹70,000 
as earnest money. They asserted that Defendant No. 
1 was authorized to act on behalf of Defendant Nos. 

Page 6 of 26 
 
6 to 8 by virtue of the General Power of Attorney dated 
30.12.1982 (Ext.1), which empowered him to sell the 
property. 
The 
plaintiffs 
emphasized 
that 
the 
agreement stipulated the sisters (Defendant Nos. 6 to 
8) would come to Baripada within three months to 
execute the sale deed, and they were assured by 
Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra that the sisters 
had consented to the sale. They maintained that they 
were always ready and willing to perform their part of 
the 
contract, 
including 
paying 
the 
balance 
consideration and completing the sale. Furthermore, 
they argued that the subsequent sale deed executed 
on 27.09.1993 in favour of Defendant Nos. 9 to 11 
was invalid and not binding on them, as it was 
executed with full knowledge of the prior agreement 
with the plaintiffs. 
4. The 
defendants, 
in 
their 
respective 
written 
statements, refuted the plaintiffs' claims. They 
contended that Defendant No. 1 did not have the 
authority to sell the property on behalf of Defendant 
Nos. 6 to 8. They argued that the General Power of 
Attorney (Ext.1) was limited in scope and effectively 
revoked by the partition deed dated 17.02.1988 
(Ext.6/a), which allocated specific shares to each co-

Page 7 of 26 
 
owner and only authorized Defendant No. 1 to collect 
rent, not to sell the property. The defendants 
maintained that the agreement dated 06.06.1993 
was incomplete and unenforceable, as it was 
contingent 
upon 
obtaining 
the 
consent 
and 
participation of Defendant Nos. 6 to 8, which was 
never secured. They further asserted that the 
plaintiffs failed to fulfil the terms of the agreement, 
particularly in not ensuring the presence and 
consent of the sisters within the stipulated time, 
indicating lack of readiness and willingness to 
perform their obligations. The defendants highlighted 
that the sale deed executed on 27.09.1993 in favour 
of Defendant Nos. 9 to 11 was valid, having been 
executed with the full consent and participation of all 
co-owners, including Defendant Nos. 6 to 8. They 
asserted that the appellants were bona fide 
purchasers 
for 
value 
without 
notice 
of 
any 
enforceable prior agreement, rendering the plaintiffs' 
claims untenable 
5. The Trial Court, after framing issues and examining 
the evidence, dismissed the suit of the plaintiffs for 
specific performance. The key findings of the Trial 
Court were as follows: 

Page 8 of 26 
 
5.1. The Court found that the agreement dated 
06.06.1993 was executed only by Defendant No. 
1 and late Soumendra, without any signatures 
or explicit consent from Defendant Nos. 6 to 8. 
The agreement itself acknowledged that the 
sisters were not present and their willingness 
needed to be secured, stating that they would 
come to Baripada within three months to 
execute the sale deed. 
5.2.  The Trial Court examined the General Power of 
Attorney and concluded that it did not explicitly 
authorize Defendant No. 1 to sell the property 
on behalf of the sisters. Moreover, the GPA was 
impliedly revoked by the subsequent partition 
deed (Ext.6/a), which allocated specific shares 
to 
each 
co-owner 
and 
only 
authorized 
Defendant No. 1 to collect rent, not to sell the 
property. 
5.3.  The agreement was deemed incomplete and 
unenforceable against Defendant Nos. 6 to 8, as 
their consent and participation were essential 
for a valid sale. The agreement's reliance on 
future consent rendered it a contingent contract 

Page 9 of 26 
 
that did not materialize within the stipulated 
time.  
5.4.  The Court observed that the plaintiffs failed to 
demonstrate 
continuous 
readiness 
and 
willingness to perform their part of the contract. 
They did not take effective steps to secure the 
consent and presence of the sisters within the 
three-month period specified in the agreement. 
Their inaction and reliance solely on Defendant 
No. 1 and late Soumendra indicated a lack of 
diligence and commitment to fulfilling the 
contractual obligations.  
5.5. The 
Court 
considered 
whether 
specific 
performance could be granted for the 2/5th 
share belonging to Defendant No. 1 and late 
Soumendra. It concluded that such partial 
enforcement was impractical and inequitable, 
given the nature of the property and its existing 
lease to Defendant No. 12. Splitting ownership 
would complicate the tenancy and could not be 
reasonably executed.  
5.6.  The Court held that the sale deed dated 
27.09.1993 executed in favour of Defendant 
Nos. 9 to 11 was valid and binding. The 

Page 10 of 26 
 
appellants were bona fide purchasers who had 
completed the transaction with all rightful 
owners, including Defendant Nos. 6 to 8. The 
plaintiffs' prior agreement did not create any 
interest in the property that could invalidate the 
appellants' title. Recognizing that the plaintiffs 
had paid ₹70,000 as earnest money, the Court 
ordered that they were entitled to a refund of 
this amount with pendente lite and future 
interest at 6% per annum from Defendant Nos. 
1 to 5 (the legal heirs of late Soumendra 
included). 
6. Aggrieved by the Trial Court's judgment, the plaintiffs 
filed a first appeal before the High Court of Orissa. 
On appeal, the High Court reversed the Trial Court's 
judgment and decreed the suit in favour of the 
plaintiffs. It held that the General Power of Attorney 
dated 30.12.1982 was valid and conferred authority 
upon Defendant No. 1 to act on behalf of Defendant 
Nos. 6 to 8, rejecting the notion that it was impliedly 
revoked by the partition deed dated 17.02.1988. The 
High Court found that the alleged revocation of the 
GPA was forged and not genuine. It concluded that 
the agreement dated 06.06.1993 was valid and 

Page 11 of 26 
 
enforceable against all defendants, including the 
sisters, and that the plaintiffs were always ready and 
willing to perform their part of the contract. 
Consequently, the High Court granted specific 
performance of the contract, directing all defendants, 
including Defendant Nos. 9 to 11 (appellants herein), 
to execute the sale deed in favour of the plaintiffs 
upon payment of the balance consideration. 
7. Aggrieved by the judgment and decree of the High 
Court, the appellants (Defendant Nos. 9 to 11) have 
preferred the present appeal before this Court. 
Having heard the learned counsel for both parties 
and perused the records, the following main issues 
arise for determination: 
I. Whether the plaintiffs proved their continuous 
readiness and willingness to perform their part of 
the contract as mandated under Section 16(c) of 
the Specific Relief Act, 1963. 
II. Whether the agreement to sell dated 06.06.1993 
was valid and enforceable against Defendant Nos. 
6 to 8, considering that Defendant No. 1 lacked the 
authority to act on their behalf without a valid and 
subsisting General Power of Attorney. 

Page 12 of 26 
 
III. Whether the relief of specific performance, being 
discretionary, having been denied by the Trial 
Court was rightly granted by the High Court in the 
facts and circumstances of the present case. 
 
I. 
Readiness and Willingness of the Plaintiffs to 
Perform the Contract 
8. Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, 
mandates 
that 
a 
plaintiff 
seeking 
specific 
performance of a contract must aver and prove that 
they have performed or have always been ready and 
willing to perform the essential terms of the contract 
which are to be performed by them. This requirement 
is a condition precedent and must be established by 
the plaintiff throughout the proceedings. The 
readiness and willingness of the plaintiff are to be 
determined from their conduct prior to and 
subsequent to the filing of the suit, as well as from 
the terms of the agreement and surrounding 
circumstances. The rationale behind this provision is 
to ensure that a party seeking equitable relief has 
acted equitably themselves. Specific performance is a 
discretionary relief, and the plaintiff must come to the 

Page 13 of 26 
 
court with clean hands, demonstrating sincerity and 
earnestness in fulfilling their contractual obligations. 
Any laxity, indifference, or failure to perform their 
part of the contract can be a ground to deny such 
relief. The importance of readiness and willingness 
for enforcement of specific performance has been 
summarized by this Court in U.N. Krishnamurthy v. 
A.M. Krishnamurthy1, as follows: 
“23. Section 16 (c) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 bars 
the relief of specific performance of a contract in 
favour of a person, who fails to aver and prove his 
readiness and willingness to perform his part of 
contract. In view of Explanation (i) to clause (c) of 
Section 16, it may not be essential for the plaintiff to 
actually tender money to the defendant or to deposit 
money in court, except when so directed by the Court, 
to prove readiness and willingness to perform the 
essential terms of a contract, which involves payment 
of money. However, Explanation (ii) says the plaintiff 
must aver performance or readiness and willingness 
to perform the contract according to its true 
construction. 
24. To aver and prove readiness and willingness to 
perform an obligation to pay money, in terms of a 
 
1 (2023) 1 SCC 775 

Page 14 of 26 
 
contract, the plaintiff would have to make specific 
statements in the plaint and adduce evidence to show 
availability of funds to make payment in terms of the 
contract in time. In other words, the plaintiff would 
have to plead that the plaintiff had sufficient funds or 
was in a position to raise funds in time to discharge 
his obligation under the contract. If the plaintiff does 
not have sufficient funds with him to discharge his 
obligations in terms of a contract, which requires 
payment of money, the plaintiff would have to 
specifically plead how the funds would be available to 
him. To cite an example, the plaintiff may aver and 
prove, by adducing evidence, an arrangement with a 
financier for disbursement of adequate funds for 
timely compliance with the terms and conditions of a 
contract involving payment of money. 
       xxx

45. It is settled law that for relief of specific 
performance, the plaintiff has to prove that all along 
and till the final decision of the suit, he was ready and 
willing to perform his part of the contract. It is the 
bounden duty of the plaintiff to prove his readiness 
and willingness by adducing evidence. This crucial 
facet has to be determined by considering all 
circumstances including availability of funds and 
mere statement or averment in plaint of readiness 
and willingness, would not suffice.” 

Page 15 of 26 
 
9. The Trial Court rightly concluded that the plaintiffs 
failed to demonstrate continuous readiness and 
willingness to perform their part of the contract. The 
agreement dated 06.06.1993 explicitly required the 
plaintiffs to ensure that Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 would 
come to Baripada within three months to execute the 
sale deed. The plaintiffs, however, did not take any 
concrete steps to secure the consent or presence of 
the sisters within the stipulated period. They relied 
solely on Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra to 
procure the sisters, despite knowing that the sisters 
were not signatories to the agreement and held a 
significant share in the property. The Trial Court 
observed that the plaintiffs did not issue any notices 
or correspondence to Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 during 
the three-month period, nor did they make any efforts 
to communicate with them directly to expedite the 
execution of the sale deed. This inaction on the part 
of the plaintiffs indicated a lack of diligence and 
earnestness in fulfilling their contractual obligations. 
Furthermore, the plaintiffs continued to operate their 
petrol pump on the suit land without taking proactive 
steps 
to 
complete 
the 
purchase, 
suggesting 
complacency and a lack of urgency. 

Page 16 of 26 
 
10. The High Court, in contrast, summarily concluded 
that the plaintiffs were always ready and willing to 
perform their part of the contract. It stated that there 
was an abundance of evidence on record to establish 
the plaintiffs' financial capacity and willingness. 
However, the High Court did not delve into the 
specifics of the plaintiffs' conduct or address the Trial 
Court's findings regarding their inaction. The High 
Court's assessment on this crucial aspect was 
cursory and lacked a thorough examination of the 
evidence and circumstances that demonstrated the 
plaintiffs' lack of readiness and willingness. 
11. Upon perusal of the records and submissions, we find 
merit in the appellants' contention that the plaintiffs 
failed to prove their continuous readiness and 
willingness as required under Section 16(c) of the 
Specific Relief Act. The terms of the agreement 
imposed specific obligations on the plaintiffs, 
particularly in ensuring that Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 
would participate in the execution of the sale deed 
within three months. The plaintiffs' failure to take 
any initiative in this regard is indicative of their lack 
of commitment to perform the contract. It is pertinent 
to note that the plaintiffs were aware that Defendant 

Page 17 of 26 
 
Nos. 6 to 8 were not parties to the agreement and that 
their consent was crucial for the completion of the 
sale. Despite this knowledge, the plaintiffs did not 
attempt to contact the sisters or address any 
correspondence to them. The plaintiffs also did not 
furnish any evidence to show that they had arranged 
the balance consideration amount or were prepared 
to pay it upon execution of the sale deed. 
12. The reliance placed by the plaintiffs on Defendant No. 
1 and late Soumendra to bring their sisters for 
execution cannot absolve them of their responsibility 
to demonstrate readiness and willingness. In 
contracts involving multiple parties with distinct 
interests, especially when some parties are absent or 
not signatories, the onus is on the plaintiff to ensure 
that all necessary consents and participations are 
secured. The plaintiffs' passive approach and failure 
to act proactively undermine their claim of readiness 
and willingness. Moreover, the plaintiffs did not raise 
any objection or take legal action immediately after 
the expiry of the three-month period specified in the 
agreement. Their delay in asserting their rights and 
pursuing the completion of the contract further 
indicates a lack of earnestness. It was only after the 

Page 18 of 26 
 
sale deed was executed in favour of the appellants 
that the plaintiffs sought to enforce the agreement, 
which suggests an afterthought rather than genuine 
intent. 
13. In light of the above reasoning, we agree with the Trial 
Court's findings that the plaintiffs failed to prove their 
continuous readiness and willingness to perform 
their part of the contract as mandated under Section 
16(c) of the Specific Relief Act. The High Court erred 
in not adequately addressing this critical aspect and 
in overlooking the plaintiffs' inaction and lack of 
diligence. The plaintiffs' failure to comply with the 
essential terms of the agreement and to take 
necessary 
steps 
within 
the 
stipulated 
time 
demonstrates a lack of readiness and willingness, 
which is fatal to their claim for specific performance. 
 
II. 
General Power of Attorney and validity of the 
Sale agreement dated 06.06.1993.  
14. In contracts involving multiple owners of property, it 
is imperative that all co-owners either personally 
execute the agreement to sell or duly authorize an 
agent to act on their behalf through a valid and 
subsisting power of attorney. An agent's authority 

Page 19 of 26 
 
must be clear and unambiguous, and any limitations 
or revocations of such authority must be duly 
considered. Without proper authority, an agent 
cannot bind the principals to a contract of sale.  
15. The Trial Court examined the General Power of 
Attorney dated 30.12.1982, purportedly executed by 
Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 and late Soumendra in favour 
of Defendant No. 1 and held that the GPA was 
unregistered and executed over a decade prior to the 
agreement to sell. Moreover, the Trial Court also 
observed that GPA was not referenced or relied upon 
in the agreement dated 06.06.1993 and there was no 
mention that Defendant No. 1 was acting as an agent 
on behalf of his sisters under the GPA. It was held 
that the Defendant No. 1 signed the agreement solely 
in his personal capacity, and there was no indication 
that he was executing it on behalf of Defendant Nos. 
6 to 8. The High Court disagreed with the Trial Court, 
holding that the GPA was valid and in force at the 
time of the agreement. It opined that the lack of 
explicit reference to the GPA in the agreement did not 
invalidate Defendant No. 1's authority to act on 
behalf of his sisters.  

Page 20 of 26 
 
16. In our considered opinion, the High Court erred in its 
assessment of the authority of Defendant No. 1 to 
bind Defendant Nos. 6 to 8. While it is legally 
permissible for an agent to bind a principal even if 
the agency relationship is not disclosed, this 
principle applies when the agent has valid and 
subsisting authority. In the present case, the GPA 
was executed in 1982 and was unregistered. The 
subsequent registered partition deed in 1988 
allocated specific shares to each co-owner and 
delineated their rights and authorities. Moreover, The 
partition deed dated 17.02.1988 impliedly revoked 
any 
prior 
authority 
granted 
under 
the 
GPA 
concerning the sale of the property. By specifying that 
Defendant No. 1 was authorized only to collect rent, 
it limited his authority and implicitly withdrew any 
broader powers previously granted. It must be 
emphasized that the agreement dated 06.06.1993 did 
not mention the GPA or indicate that Defendant No. 
1 was acting on behalf of his sisters. He signed the 
agreement solely in his capacity, and there was no 
representation made to the plaintiffs that he had the 
authority to bind the sisters. This omission is 
significant, as the plaintiffs were aware that the 

Page 21 of 26 
 
sisters' consent was essential, which is evident from 
the agreement's stipulation that the sisters would 
come to execute the sale deed within three months. 
17. The plaintiffs were cognizant of the fact that 
Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 were not parties to the 
agreement 
and 
that 
their 
willingness 
and 
participation were necessary for a valid sale. This is 
further 
corroborated 
by 
the 
plaintiffs' 
own 
admissions that they were assured by Defendant No. 
1 and late Soumendra that the sisters would be 
brought to execute the sale deed. Thus, the plaintiffs 
cannot claim that they believed Defendant No. 1 had 
the authority to bind the sisters without their explicit 
consent. The appellants have rightly pointed out that 
an agent's authority must be explicit, and any 
limitations or revocations thereof must be given due 
consideration. In the absence of a valid and 
subsisting power of attorney authorizing Defendant 
No. 1 to sell the property on behalf of Defendant Nos. 
6 to 8, the agreement cannot be enforced against 
them. 
18. In view of the above, we hold that Defendant No. 1 
lacked the authority to bind Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 in 
the agreement to sell dated 06.06.1993. The General 

Page 22 of 26 
 
Power of Attorney did not confer upon him the power 
to sell the property on behalf of his sisters at the time 
of the agreement, having been impliedly revoked by 
the partition deed. The agreement was, therefore, 
incomplete and unenforceable against Defendant 
Nos. 6 to 8, who collectively held a majority share in 
the property. The plaintiffs' knowledge of the 
necessity of obtaining the sisters' consent, coupled 
with their failure to secure such consent, renders the 
agreement ineffective against Defendant Nos. 6 to 8. 
Consequently, the agreement cannot be specifically 
enforced against them, and the plaintiffs cannot 
claim any right over their shares in the property 
based on the said agreement. 
III. Discretionary Nature of Granting Specific 
Performance 
19. The relief of specific performance under the Specific 
Relief Act, 1963, is discretionary in nature. Section 
20 of the Act (applicable to this case as it predates 
the 2018 amendment) explicitly stated that the court 
is not bound to grant such relief merely because it is 
lawful to do so. The discretion must be exercised 
judiciously and based on sound principles, ensuring 

Page 23 of 26 
 
that granting specific performance is just and 
equitable in the circumstances of the case. 
20. In the present case, several factors weigh against 
granting specific performance. The agreement to sell 
was incomplete and unenforceable against Defendant 
Nos. 6 to 8, who held a majority share in the property; 
enforcing such an agreement would be inequitable. 
The plaintiffs failed to demonstrate readiness and 
willingness to perform their obligations and did not 
take necessary steps to secure the consent of all co-
owners. 
Granting 
specific 
performance 
would 
unfairly 
prejudice 
the 
defendants, 
especially 
Defendant Nos. 6 to 8, who never consented to the 
sale to the plaintiffs. Furthermore, the plaintiffs can 
be adequately compensated by a refund of the 
earnest money with interest; there is no evidence to 
suggest that monetary compensation would not 
suffice. 
21. Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 prior to 
amendment by Act No. 18 of 2018 which was brought 
into effect w.e.f. 1.10.2018 categorically provided that 
the relief of specific performance is discretionary in 
nature and the court is not bound to grant such relief 
merely because it is lawful to do so. But the discretion 

Page 24 of 26 
 
of the court has to be on sound and reasonable 
principles. 
22. In the present case, the plaintiffs have sought specific 
performance of the agreement dated 06.06.1993 
whereunder the sale deed was to be executed before 
30.09.1993 after obtaining the consent of the sisters 
(Defendant Nos. 6 to 8) as they had not joined the 
agreement. However, all the co-owners of the 
property transferred the suit property in favour of the 
appellants vide sale deed dated 27.09.1993 for a 
consideration of Rs. 4,20,000/-. The appellants are 
the bona fide purchasers in good faith of the suit 
property for valuable consideration. Therefore, once 
they have acquired the rights in the property way 
back on 27.09.1993, there was no justification to 
disturb the said sale deed by decreeing the suit for 
specific 
performance 
of 
the 
agreement 
dated 
06.06.1993 which was not even signed by all the co-
owners specially the three sisters (Defendant Nos. 9 
to 11). The aforesaid sale deed was not even 
challenged though it had come into existence at the 
time of filing of the suit for specific performance, 
therefore, when the Trial Court had exercised its 
discretion not to decree the suit for specific 

Page 25 of 26 
 
performance, it was not open for the appellate court 
to decree it affecting the rights of the bona fide 
purchasers i.e. the appellants. 
23. In conclusion, considering the discretionary nature of 
the relief and the principles governing its exercise, we 
find that granting specific performance in this case 
would be neither just nor equitable. The plaintiffs' 
failure to fulfil essential contractual terms, coupled 
with the lack of authority to bind all co-owners, 
renders 
the 
grant 
of 
specific 
performance 
inappropriate. The equitable remedy sought by the 
plaintiffs cannot be granted in light of their conduct 
and the circumstances of the case.  
24. In view of the foregoing analysis,  we conclude that 
the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate their continuous 
readiness 
and 
willingness 
to 
perform 
their 
contractual obligations, and that Defendant No. 1 
lacked the authority to bind Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 in 
the 
agreement 
dated 
06.06.1993. 
Given 
the 
incomplete 
and 
unenforceable 
nature 
of 
the 
agreement, we find it neither just nor equitable to 
grant the relief sought by the plaintiffs. 
25. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The judgment and 
decree dated 25.10.2013 passed by the High Court of 

Page 26 of 26 
 
Orissa are set aside. The judgment dated 17.05.1997 
passed by the Trial Court dismissing the suit for 
specific performance is restored. Furthermore, the 
appellants are directed to refund to the plaintiffs 
(Respondent Nos. 1 & 2) a sum of ₹10,00,000 (Rupees 
Ten Lakhs) within a period of two months from the 
date of this order. This amount includes the earnest 
money paid by the plaintiffs and accounts for any 
interest and expenses incurred. 
26. There shall be no order as to costs.
