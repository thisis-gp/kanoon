The instant appeal was originally preferred as a petition 
before this Court, which is moved against the impugned 
Judgment dated 03.03.2023 in Criminal Appeal No. 
200139 of 2019 by the High Court of Karnataka at 
Kalaburagi whereby the learned Single Judge affirmed 
the acquittal of the Respondent in Complaint Case No. 
468 of 2014 moved for the offence punishable under 
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881

3. 
The factual backdrop giving rise to the present challenge 
is that the Appellant is the original complainant who 
claims to know the sole Respondent for the last six years 
and that he had borrowed INR 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two 
Lakhs only) from the Appellant on account of family 
necessities and accommodation. Against the said loan 
the Respondent issued a cheque bearing No. 015639 
which was drawn on the Bank of India, as a guarantee 
against repayment. He was to repay the said loan 
amount within a period of six months thereof. An 
agreement to this effect was also signed between the 
parties. 
4. 
However, since the Respondent failed to repay the loan 
despite repeated requests, the Appellant presented the 
concerned cheque for encashment on 22.10.2013, but 
nevertheless, as per the Bank Memo dated 24.10.2013, 
the cheque was dishonoured on account of “insufficient 
funds”. 
5. 
Aggrieved from the said dishonour of cheque, a Demand 
Notice dated 31.10.2013 was sent by the Appellant to 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 3 of 28 
 
the Respondent, whereby, the Counsel on behalf of the 
Appellant alleged that the Respondent had intentionally 
cheated him and had not made any efforts to discharge 
his liability. Accordingly, the Respondent was said to 
have committed offences punishable under Section 138 
of the NI Act 1881 and Section 420 of the Indian Penal 
Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as “IPC 1860”). 
6. 
Thereupon, the Respondent moved a Reply Notice dated 
11.11.2013 whereby he claimed that the accusations 
made by the Appellant are false and bereft of pertinent 
details of the loan transaction, inter alia, the date and 
time of advancement of the said debt, which as claimed, 
was never advanced. 
7. 
Unsatisfied with the response of the Respondent 
through the said Reply Notice, Appellant moved a Private 
Complaint No. 991 of 2013 under Section 200 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred 
to as “CrPC 1973”). The said complaint came to be 
registered as CC/468/2014 before Judicial Magistrate 
First Class at Gulbarga. As part of the proceedings 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 4 of 28 
 
before the Trial Court, the Appellant examined himself 
as PW-01, while the Respondent examined himself as 
DW-01. However, the latter did not mark any documents 
from his side. It was the Respondent’s plea that the 
concerned cheque was issued in favour of one Mr 
Mallikarjun in the year 2012 for security purposes, 
however, he did not return the same to the Respondent, 
and instead had left the village. While dealing with the 
said contention, the Trial Court observed that the 
Respondent had failed to explain as to how the cheque 
landed in the hands of the Appellant, and for what 
purpose was the cheque issued to Mr Mallikarjun.  
8. 
It was also revealed as part of the statement during 
cross-examination of the Appellant that the cheque was 
originally, not given to the Appellant as security cheque. 
Instead, the same was allegedly given to the Appellant 
after the Respondent had thereby failed to repay his 
liability as existing against the Appellant after a period 
of six months. The Court further observed that the 
Agreement marked by the Appellant to assist his case 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 5 of 28 
 
does not include signature of the Respondent as against 
the terms of the agreement, but a signature is made by 
the Respondent on the stamp paper itself, and the same 
is not sustainable in the eyes of law. The Court also went 
on to scrutinize the Income Tax Returns of the Appellant, 
from where it was revealed that the Appellant failed to 
declare the alleged loan transaction as part of his 
returns to the Income Tax Department. Accordingly, vide 
its Judgment dated 18.10.2019, the Trial Court 
adjudicated in favour of the Respondent, resultantly 
dismissing the complaint moved by the Appellant and 
acquitting the Respondent.  
9. 
Aggrieved by the decision of Trial Court, the Appellant 
moved the High Court of Karnataka in Criminal Appeal 
No. 200139 of 2019, which went on to observe that, 
admittedly, there was a contradiction in the statement 
of the Appellant as to when the cheque was issued in his 
favour.  Furthermore, as was laid down in the decision 
of this Court in Rangappa v. Sri Mohan1, the 
 
1 (2010) 11 SCC 441. 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 6 of 28 
 
presumption under Section 139 of the NI Act 1881 is a 
rebuttable one. The contention of the Respondent as to 
the financial capacity of the Appellant to grant a loan in 
his favour was to be discharged by him, and being 
unable to do so, it shall be presumed that a loan 
transaction had not taken place. Accordingly, the 
findings of the Trial Court were affirmed in the impugned 
Judgment dated 03.03.2023. 
10. The Appellant has thereupon moved this Court in 
challenge to the said impugned judgment on the 
grounds that as the signature on the concerned cheque 
was admitted by the Respondent, the Appellant was able 
to successfully raise a presumption under Section 139 
of the NI Act 1881 and as per the submissions of the 
Respondent, 
he 
had 
failed 
to 
rebut 
the 
said 
presumption. He also put forth that the reliance on the 
decision in Rangappa (supra) by the High Court was 
misplaced, and even going by the standard of 
preponderance of probabilities, the Respondent failed to 
discharge his onus. 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 7 of 28 
 
11. Having heard the learned Senior Advocate for the 
Appellant as well as the learned Counsel on behalf of the 
Respondent, it is imperative to deliberate over the 
position of law apropos the applicable provisions of the 
NI Act 1881, and others, if any. 
12. Earlier, a case of dishonour of a cheque was dealt 
through provisions of Section 420 read with Section 415 
of the IPC 1860. To enhance the acceptability of cheques 
as well as to provide for adequate safeguards to prevent 
harassment of honest drawers through painting the 
liability arising out of dishonour of a cheque with a 
punitive brush, an amendment to the NI Act 1881 was 
brought about by introducing Chapter VIII. Thence, 
seeking to promote credibility in transactions through 
the medium of banking channels and operations as well 
as their efficacy. Section 138 of the NI Act 1881 is 
reproduced below as: 
“138. Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., 
of funds in the account. 
Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account 
maintained by him with a banker for payment of any 
amount of money to another person from out of that 
account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any 
debt or other liability, is returned by the bank unpaid, 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 8 of 28 
 
either because of the amount of money standing to the 
credit of that account is insufficient to honour the 
cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be 
paid from that account by an agreement made with that 
bank, such person shall be deemed to have committed 
an offence and shall, without prejudice to any other 
provision of this Act, be punished with imprisonment for 
a term which may be extended to two years’, or with 
fine which may extend to twice the amount of the 
cheque, or with both:  
Provided that nothing contained in this section shall 
apply unless—  
(a) the cheque has been presented to the bank 
within a period of six months from the date on 
which it is drawn or within the period of its 
validity, whichever is earlier;  
(b) the payee or the holder in due course of the 
cheque, as the case may be, makes a demand for 
the payment of the said amount of money by 
giving a notice; in writing, to the drawer of the 
cheque, within thirty days of the receipt of 
information by him from the bank regarding the 
return of the cheque as unpaid; and  
(c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the 
payment of the said amount of money to the 
payee or, as the case may be, to the holder in due 
course of the cheque, within fifteen days of the 
receipt of the said notice.  
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, “debt of 
other liability” means a legally enforceable debt or 
other liability.” 
 
13. This Court in ICDS Ltd. v. Beena Shabeer and 
Another2, has held that proceedings under Section 138 
of the NI Act 1881 can be initiated even if the cheque 
 
2 (2002) 6 SCC 426. 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 9 of 28 
 
was originally issued as security and was subsequently 
dishonoured owing to insufficient funds. The failure to 
honour the concerned cheque is per se deemed as a 
commission of an offence under Section 138 of the NI 
Act 1881. 
14. The NI Act 1881 enlists three essential conditions that 
ought to be fulfilled before the said provision of law can 
be invoked. Firstly, the cheque ought to have been 
presented within the period of its validity. Secondly, a 
demand of payment ought to have been made by the 
presenter of the cheque to the issuer, and lastly, the 
drawer ought to have had failed to pay the amount 
within a period of 15 days of the receipt of the demand. 
These 
principles 
and 
pre-requisites 
stand 
well 
established through Judgment of this Court in 
Sadanandan Bhadran v. Madhavan Sunil Kumar3. 
There is an explicit limitation of 30 days, beginning from 
period when the cause of action arose, prescribed by the 
 
3 (1998) 6 SCC 514. 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 10 of 28 
 
statute vide Section 142(b) of the NI Act 1881 to initiate 
proceedings under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881. 
15. Furthermore, this Court expounded that the issuance of 
cheque towards a liability, the presentation of the 
cheque within the prescribed period, its return on 
account of dishonour, notice to the accused, and failure 
to pay within 15 days thereof, stand as sine qua non for 
an offence under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881 as per 
the decision in K. Bhaskaran v. Sankaran Vaidhyan 
Balan and Another4. The same was subsequently 
reiterated in numerous judgments of this Court as well 
as that of the High Courts. 
16. While referring to the period of limitation of one month 
of filing a complaint for the purpose of Section 138 of the 
NI Act 1881, the same is to begin after the drawer of the 
cheque has failed to discharge his liability to the 
presenter within the prescribed period of 15 days as per 
the Proviso (c) to Section 138 of the NI Act 1881. A co-
joint reading of Sections 138 and 142 of the NI Act 1881 
 
4 (1999) 7 SCC 510. 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 11 of 28 
 
makes it clear that the cause of action only arises after 
the failure of the drawer to pay, subsequent to the 
receipt of the notice, and the complainant is restricted 
from 
initiating 
multiple 
complaints 
against 
the 
concerned drawer at different stages contemplated prior.  
17. Furthermore, in light of such object encapsulated in the 
Amendment to Chapter VIII, the Parliament by virtue of 
Section 143 of the NI Act 1881 prescribed procedure of 
summary trial enlisted in provisions of Sections 260 to 
265 of the CrPC 1973 to be adopted during proceedings 
under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881. Therefore, it can 
be observed that the court shall adopt a liberal approach 
with regard to attendance of an accused person and 
until an accused’s presence is indispensable, a court can 
allow for an exemption, in case of existence of any 
exceptional circumstances. Moreover, issuance of a non-
bailable warrant in case of absence of the accused, at 
the first instance, shall, due to any circumstance, be 
avoided.  

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 12 of 28 
 
18. As the presumption contemplated by virtue of Section 
118 of the NI Act 1881 entails, Section 139 was similarly 
introduced to provide for a presumption that the holder 
of cheque had received the concerned issued cheque 
towards discharging of the liability of the drawer, either 
in whole or in part. Therefore, at this juncture, it is ideal 
to make a reference to Section 118 of the NI Act 1881, 
which is reproduced as: 
“118. Presumptions as to negotiable instruments 
Until the contrary is proved, the following presumptions 
shall be made:—  
(a) of 
consideration:—that 
every 
negotiable 
instrument 
was 
made 
or 
drawn 
for 
consideration, and that every such instrument, 
when it has been accepted, indorsed, negotiated 
or 
transferred, 
was 
accepted, 
indorsed, 
negotiated or transferred for consideration;  
(b) as to date:—that every negotiable instrument 
bearing a date was made or drawn on such date;  
(c) as to time of acceptance:—that every accepted 
bill of exchange was accepted within a 
reasonable time after its date and before its 
maturity;  
(d) as to time of transfer: —that every transfer of a 
negotiable instrument was made before its 
maturity;  
(e) as 
to 
order 
of 
indorsements:—that 
the 
indorsements appearing upon a negotiable 
instrument were made in the order in which they 
appear then on;  
(f) as to stamp:— that a lost promissory note, bill of 
exchange or cheque was duly stamped;  

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 13 of 28 
 
(g) that holder is a holder in due course:—that the 
holder of a negotiable instrument is a holder in 
due course: provided that, where the instrument 
has been obtained from its lawful owner, or from 
any person in lawful custody thereof, by means 
of an offence or fraud, or has been obtained from 
the maker or acceptor thereof by means of an 
offence or fraud, or for unlawful consideration, 
the burden of proving that the holder is a holder 
in due course lies upon him.” 
 
Chapter XIII of the NI Act 1881, of which Section 118 is 
a part, lays down special rules for evidence to be 
adduced within the scheme of the Act herein. As the text 
of the said provision showcases, it raises a rebuttable 
presumption as against the drawer to the extent that the 
concerned negotiable instrument was drawn and 
subsequently 
accepted, 
indorsed, 
negotiated, 
or 
transferred for an existing consideration, and the date 
so designated on such an instrument is the date when 
the concerned negotiable instrument was drawn. It is 
also further presumed that the same was transferred 
before its maturity and that the order in which multiple 
indorsements appear on such an instrument, that is the 
deemed order thereon. Lastly, the holder of a negotiable 
instrument is one in its due course, subject to a 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 14 of 28 
 
situation where the concerned instrument while being 
obtained from a lawful owner and from his or her lawful 
custody thereof through undertaking of an offence as 
contemplated under any statute or through the means 
of fraud, the burden to prove him or her being a holder 
in due course, instead, lies upon such a holder.   
19. Accordingly, to begin with, the bare provision of Section 
139 of the NI Act 1881 is reproduced herein below: 
“139. Presumption in favour of holder—It shall be 
presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the 
holder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature 
referred to in section138 for the discharge, in whole or 
in part, of any debt or other liability.” 
 
The aforesaid presumption entails an obligation on the 
court conducting the trial for an offence under Section 
138 of the NI Act 1881 to presume that the cheque in 
question was issued by the drawer or accused for the 
discharge of a particular liability. The use of expression 
“shall presume” ameliorates the conundrum pertaining 
to the right of the accused to present evidence for the 
purpose 
of 
rebutting 
the 
said 
presumption. 
Furthermore, the effect of such presumption is that, 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 15 of 28 
 
upon filing of the complaint along with relevant 
documents, thereby prima facie establishing the case 
against the drawer, the onus of proof shifts on the 
drawer or accused to adduce cogent material and 
evidence for rebutting the said presumption, and as 
established in Laxmi Dyechem v. State of Gujarat and 
Others5, based on preponderance of probabilities. 
20. While describing the offence envisaged under Section 
138 of the NI Act 1881 as a regulatory offence for largely 
being in the nature of a civil wrong with its impact 
confined 
to 
private 
parties 
within 
commercial 
transactions, the 3-Judge Bench in the decision of 
Rangappa (supra) highlighted Section 139 of the NI Act 
1881 to be an example of a reverse onus clause. This is 
done so, as the Court expounds, in the light of 
Parliament’s intent, which can be culled out from the 
peculiar placing of act of dishonour of cheque in a 
statute having criminal overtones. The underlying object 
of such deliberate placement is to inject and enhance 
 
5 (2012) 13 SCC 375. 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 16 of 28 
 
credibility of negotiable instruments. Additionally, the 
reverse onus clause serves as an indispensable “device 
to prevent undue delay in the course of litigation”. While 
acknowledging the test of proportionality and having laid 
the interpretation of Section 139 of the NI Act 1881 
hereof, it was further held that an accused cannot be 
obligated to rebut the said presumption through an 
unduly high standard of proof. This is in light of the 
observations laid down by a co-ordinate Bench in Hiten 
P. Dalal v. Bratindranath Banerjee6, whereby it was 
clarified that the rebuttal ought not to be undertaken 
conclusively by an accused, which is reiterated as 
follows: 
“23. In other words, provided the facts required to form 
the basis of a presumption of law exist, no discretion is 
left with the court but to draw the statutory conclusion, 
but this does not preclude the person against whom the 
presumption is drawn from rebutting it and proving the 
contrary. A fact is said to be proved when,  
‘after considering the matters before it, the court 
either believes it to exist, or considers its existence 
so probable that a prudent man ought, under the 
circumstances of the particular case, to act upon 
the supposition that it exists’ [Section 3, Evidence 
Act].  
 
6 (2001) 6 SCC 16. 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 17 of 28 
 
Therefore, the rebuttal does not have to be conclusively 
established but such evidence must be adduced before 
the court in support of the defence that the court must 
either believe the defence to exist or consider its 
existence to be reasonably probable, the standard of 
reasonability being that of the ‘prudent man’.” 
 
Therefore, it may be said that the liability of the defence 
in cases under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881 is not that 
of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt.  
21. In light of the aforesaid discussion, and as underscored 
by this Court recently in the decision of Rajesh Jain v. 
Ajay Singh7, an accused may establish non-existence of 
a debt or liability either through conclusive evidence that 
the concerned cheque was not issued towards the 
presumed debt or liability, or through adduction of 
circumstantial evidence vide standard of preponderance 
of probabilities.  
22. Since a presumption only enables the holder to show a 
prima facie case, it can only survive before a court of law 
subject to contrary not having been proved to the effect 
that a cheque or negotiable instrument was not issued 
for a consideration or for discharge of any existing or 
 
7 (2023) 10 SCC 148. 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 18 of 28 
 
future debt or liability. In this backdrop, it is pertinent 
to make a reference to a decision of 3-Judge Bench in 
Bir Singh v. Mukesh Kumar8, which went on to hold 
that if a signature on a blank cheque stands admitted to 
having been inscribed voluntarily, it is sufficient to 
trigger a presumption under Section 139 of the NI Act 
1881, even if there is no admission to the effect of 
execution of entire contents in the cheque. 
23. It is therefore apposite to make a reference to the 
provision of Section 140 of the NI Act 1881, which 
ruminates mens rea to be immaterial while dealing with 
proceedings under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881. The 
said legislative wisdom of the Parliament which is 
imbibed in the bare text of the provision is reproduced 
as below:  
“140. Defence which may not be allowed in any 
prosecution under section 138—It shall not be a 
defence in a prosecution for an offence under section 
138 that the drawer had no reason to believe when he 
issued the cheque that the cheque may be dishonoured 
on presentment for the reasons stated in that section.” 
 
 
8 (2019) 4 SCC 197. 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 19 of 28 
 
24. Through this legal fiction adopted by the legislature vide 
Amendment Act of 1988 to the NI Act 1881 it has barred 
the drawer of a cheque, which was dishonoured, to take 
a defence that at the time of issuance of the cheque in 
question he or she had no reason to believe that the 
same will be dishonoured upon being presented by the 
holder of such a cheque, especially and specifically for 
the reasons underlined in Section 138 of the NI Act 
1881.  
25. A comprehensive reference to the Sections 118, 139 and 
140 of the NI Act 1881 gives birth to a deemed fiction 
which was also articulated by this Court in K.N. Beena 
v. Muniyappan and Another9 as follows:  
“Under section 118, unless the contrary was proved, it 
is to be presumed that the negotiable instrument 
(including a cheque) had been made or drawn for 
consideration. Under section 139 the court has to 
presume, unless the contrary was proved, that the 
holder of the cheque received the cheque for discharge, 
in whole or in part, of a debt or liability. Thus, in 
complaints under section 138, the court has to presume 
that the cheque had been issued for a debtor’s liability. 
This presumption is rebuttable. However, the burden of 
proving that a cheque had not been issued for a debt or 
liability is on the accused. The Supreme Court in the 
 
9 (2001) 8 SCC 458. 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 20 of 28 
 
case of Hiten P. Dalal v. Bratindranath Banerjee has 
also taken an identical view.” 
 
26. Furthermore, on the aspect of adducing evidence for 
rebuttal of the aforesaid statutory presumption, it is 
pertinent to cumulatively read the decisions of this 
Court in Rangappa (supra) and Rajesh Jain (supra) 
which would go on to clarify that accused can 
undoubtedly place reliance on the materials adduced by 
the complainant, which would include not only the 
complainant’s version in the original complaint, but also 
the case in the legal or demand notice, complainant’s 
case at the trial, as also the plea of the accused in the 
reply notice, his Section 313 CrPC 1973 statement or at 
the trial as to the circumstances under which the 
promissory note or cheque was executed.  The accused 
ought not to adduce any further or new evidence from 
his end in said circumstances to rebut the concerned 
statutory presumption. 
27. Applying the aforementioned legal position to the 
present factual matrix, it is apparent that there existed 
a contradiction in the complaint moved by the Appellant 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 21 of 28 
 
as against his cross-examination relatable to the time of 
presentation of the cheque by the Respondent as per the 
statements of the Appellant. This is to the effect that 
while the Appellant claimed the cheque to have been 
issued at the time of advancing of the loan as a security, 
however, as per his statement during the cross-
examination it was revealed that the same was 
presented when an alleged demand for repayment of 
alleged loan amount was raised before the Respondent, 
after a period of six months of advancement. 
Furthermore, there was no financial capacity or 
acknowledgement in his Income Tax Returns by the 
Appellant to the effect of having advanced a loan to the 
Respondent. Even further the Appellant has not been 
able to showcase as to when the said loan was advanced 
in favour of the Respondent nor has he been able to 
explain as to how a cheque issued by the Respondent 
allegedly in favour of Mr Mallikarjun landed in the hands 
of the instant holder, that is, the Appellant. 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 22 of 28 
 
28. Admittedly, the Appellant was able to establish that the 
signature on the cheque in question was of the 
Respondent and in regard to the decision of this Court 
in Bir Singh (supra), a presumption is to ideally arise. 
However, in the above referred context of the factual 
matrix, the inability of the Appellant to put forth the 
details of the loan advanced, and his contradictory 
statements, the ratio therein would not impact the 
present case to the effect of giving rise to the statutory 
presumption under Section 139 of the NI Act 1881. The 
Respondent has been able to shift the weight of the 
scales of justice in his favour through the preponderance 
of probabilities.  
29. The Trial Court had rightly observed that the Appellant 
was not able to plead even a valid existence of a legally 
recoverable debt as the very issuance of cheque is 
dubious based on the fallacies and contradictions in the 
evidence adduced by the parties. Furthermore, the fact 
that the Respondent had inscribed his signature on the 
agreement drawn on a white paper and not on a stamp

 Page 23 of 28 
 
paper as presented by the Appellant, creates another set 
of doubt in the case. Since the accused has been able to 
cast a shadow of doubt on the case presented by the 
Appellant, he has therefore successfully rebutted the 
presumption stipulated by Section 139 of the NI Act 
1881.  
30. Moreover, affirming the findings of the Trial Court, the 
High Court observed that while the signature of the 
Respondent on the cheque drawn by him as well as on 
the agreement between the parties herein stands 
admitted, in case where the concern of financial capacity 
of the creditor is raised on behalf of an accused, the 
same is to be discharged by the complainant through 
leading of cogent evidence.    
31. The 
instant 
case 
pertains 
to 
challenge 
against 
concurrent findings of fact favouring the acquittal of the 
respondent, it would be cogent to delve into an analysis 
of the principles underlining the exercise of power to 
adjudicate a challenge against acquittal bolstered by 
concurrent findings. The following broad principles can 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023 
 Page 24 of 28 
 
be culled out after a comprehensive analysis of judicial 
pronouncements:  
i) Criminal 
jurisprudence 
emphasises 
on 
the 
fundamental essence of liberty and presumption of 
innocence unless proven guilty. This presumption 
gets emboldened by virtue of concurrent findings of 
acquittal. Therefore, this court must be extra-
cautious while dealing with a challenge against 
acquittal as the said presumption gets reinforced by 
virtue of a well-reasoned favourable outcome. 
Consequently, the onus on the prosecution side 
becomes more burdensome pursuant to the said 
double presumption.  
ii) In case of concurrent findings of acquittal, this 
Court would ordinarily not interfere with such view 
considering the principle of liberty enshrined in 
Article 21 of the Constitution of India 1950, unless 
perversity is blatantly forthcoming and there are 
compelling reasons.

iii) Where two views are possible, then this Court would 
not ordinarily interfere and reverse the concurrent 
findings of acquittal. However, where the situation 
is such that the only conclusion which could be 
arrived at from a comprehensive appraisal of 
evidence, shows that there has been a grave 
miscarriage of justice, then, notwithstanding such 
concurrent view, this Court would not restrict itself 
to adopt an oppugnant view. [Vide State of Uttar 
Pradesh v. Dan Singh10] 
iv) To adjudge whether the concurrent findings of 
acquittal are ‘perverse’ it is to be seen whether there 
has been failure of justice. This Court in Babu v. 
State of Kerala11 clarified the ambit of the term 
‘perversity’ as  
“if the findings have been arrived at by ignoring 
or excluding relevant material or by taking into 
consideration irrelevant/admissible material. The 
finding may also be said to be perverse if it is 
‘against the weight of evidence’, or if the finding 
so outrageously defies logic as to suffer from the 
vice of irrationality.” 
 
 
10 (1997) 3 SCC 747. 
11 (2010) 9 SCC 189.

v) In situations of concurrent findings favoring 
accused, interference is required where the trial 
court adopted an incorrect approach in framing of 
an issue of fact and the appellate court whilst 
affirming the view of the trial court, lacked in 
appreciating the evidence produced by the accused 
in rebutting a legal presumption. [Vide Rajesh Jain 
v. Ajay Singh12] 
vi) Furthermore, such interference is necessitated to 
safeguard interests of justice when the acquittal is 
based on some irrelevant grounds or fallacies in re-
appreciation 
of 
any 
fundamental 
evidentiary 
material or a manifest error of law or in cases of non-
adherence to the principles of natural justice or the 
decision is manifestly unjust or where an acquittal 
which is fundamentally based on an exaggerated 
adherence to the principle of granting benefit of 
doubt to the accused, is liable to be set aside. Say in 
cases where the court severed the connection 
 
12 (2023) 10 SCC 148. 

Criminal Appeal No.3257 of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No.13179 of 2023

between accused and criminality committed by him 
upon a cursory examination of evidences. [Vide 
State of Punjab v. Gurpreet Singh and Others13 
and Rajesh Prasad v. State of Bihar14] 
32. Upon perusal of the aforementioned principles and 
applying them to the facts and circumstances of the 
present matter, it is evident that there is no perversity 
and lack of evidence in the case of the respondent-
accused. The concurrent findings have backing of 
detailed appraisal of evidences and facts, therefore, do 
not warrant interference in light of above enlisted 
principles. In a similar set of facts as in the present case, 
involving criminal liability arising out of dishonour of 
cheque, this Court in M/s Rajco Steel Enterprises v. 
Kavita Saraff and Another15  dejected from reversing 
the concurrent findings of acquittal of accused therein 
and underscored the principle of non-interference,

unless such findings are perverse or bereft of evidentiary 
corroboration or lacks question of law.  
33. In furtherance of the aforesaid principles and the 
reasons ascribed thereof, the present challenge to the 
aforesaid impugned judgment dated 03.03.2023 by the 
High Court of Karnataka at Kalaburagi is bereft of any 
merits and does not call for any interference of this 
court.   
34. The instant appeal is dismissed and the findings of the 
High Court in the impugned judgment dated 03.03.2023 
are affirmed. 
35. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.
