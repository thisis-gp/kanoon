PART A

1. 
Leave granted.  
2. 
The appellant is the founder of an organisation that promotes awareness 
about disabilities, conducts policy research and provides education to 
underprivileged children. The appellant is a person with arthrogryposis and is 
aggrieved by the manner in which persons with disabilities have been portrayed 
in the movie titled ‘Aankh Micholi’.  
3. 
The appeal arises from the judgment dated 15 January 2024 of the High 
Court of Delhi by which a petition under article 226 was dismissed on grounds of 
maintainability. 
A.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
4. 
The appellant addressed a legal notice to the first respondent, Sony 
Pictures, on 6 October 2023 raising objections to the trailer of their film. The 
appellant was particularly aggrieved by the introduction of some of the characters 
of the film, who were portrayed to suffer from physical impairments. Sony 
Pictures replied to the notice on 17 October 2023. The movie was released on 3 
November 2023 with ‘U’ certification from the Central Board of Film Certification. 
5. 
The appellant claims that the film violates the constitutionally protected 
rights of persons with disabilities; and the provisions of the Cinematograph Act, 
19521 and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 20162.  The appellant claims 
 
1 “Cinematograph Act” 
2 “RPwD Act” 

PART A  
4 
 
that the Central Board of Film Certification3 has violated its statutory duty to 
certify films in accordance with the applicable guidelines.  
6. 
He therefore sought directions:   
(i) 
Mandating the inclusion of an expert on disability within the Central 
Board of Film Certification and its advisory panel constituted under 
Sections 3 and 5 of the Cinematograph Act;  
(ii) 
Mandating the inclusion of the expert under Section 3 of the 
Cinematograph Act, 1952;  
(iii) Seeking relief against the first respondent, including punitive 
damages; and  
(iv) A public apology from the first respondent.  
7. 
The appellant has highlighted instances in the trailer as well as the film 
where certain medical conditions have been misrepresented and derogatory 
terms have been used for characters who are persons with disabilities. These 
include (a) misrepresentation of the condition of night blindness; and (b) 
derogatory references to (i) a person with Alzheimer’s as “bhulakkad baap”, (ii) a 
hearing-impaired person as a “soundproof system”; and (iii) a character with 
speech impairment as an “atki hui cassette”. The appellant submits that the film 
portrays a family of persons with various disabilities and revolves around their 
attempts to conceal their disabilities in a bid to come across as a ‘normal family’. 
The female lead is a person with nyctalopia or night blindness, while the male 
 
3 “CBFC”/”The Board”   

PART A  
5 
 
lead is a person with hemeralopia, which is an inability to see clearly in bright 
light. The plot of the film revolves around the two families of the lead characters 
concealing their impairments, in order to arrange a matrimonial alliance.  
8. 
The appellant has urged that the film’s portrayal is derogatory to persons 
with disabilities generally and conveys the message that they ought to conceal 
their impairments in order to deserve a matrimonial partner. The appellant has 
further urged  that  the film (i) reinforces stereotypes with its misguided portrayals 
of persons with disabilities, thereby creating misconceptions, biases and 
prejudices against them; (ii)  promotes the  idea that persons with disability  are 
unequal; (iii) presents them as subjects of comic relief; (iv) creates an 
environment of ridicule; (iv)  does not generate  empathy towards persons with 
disabilities; and (v) fails to promote inclusive and accurate representations of 
disabilities. In response, Sony Pictures stated that the overall message of the film 
was one of ‘overcoming the challenge of disability’; the film sought to depict the 
struggles faced by persons with disabilities and their families and in an effort to 
overcome them. The film, they claimed in the reply, sought to dislodge the idea 
that disability obstructs a fulfilling life. The reply stated further that (i) the 
introduction of the characters in the trailer is protected by the freedom of speech 
and expression; (ii) the film does not pity or look down upon the characters but 
depicts their agency and skills; (iii) the depiction is neither derogatory nor 
stereotypical.  
 
 

PART B  
6 
 
B. THE HIGH COURT  
9. 
The High Court of Delhi noted that the appellant had not disputed the 
explanation offered by the first respondent that the overall message of the film 
was around overcoming the disability and dwelt on the strength of the characters 
suffering from disabilities. The Court noted that the primary challenge that the film 
is offensive to the sensibilities of persons with disabilities, is thus not established. 
Underlining that the film was granted certification for unrestricted public exhibition 
by CBFC, the High Court held that the reliefs sought by the appellant were non-
maintainable. 
10. 
Summarised briefly, the High Court's findings are:  
(i) 
The first respondent’s reply refutes the allegations made in the notice. 
They contested any suggestion that the movie's intent was to offend 
or humiliate differently-abled persons. Instead, they elucidated the 
overarching message of the film as intended by its creator;  
(ii) 
The appellant did not raise further grievances after receiving the reply 
and until filing the petition, indicating a lack of challenge to the film's 
alleged offensive nature;  
(iii) There is a lack of legal justification for the reliefs sought; and  
(iv) This dismissal is reinforced by the existence of guidelines issued by 
the Central Government under Section 5B(2) of the Act of 1952. 
These guidelines, including specific provisions for persons with 
disabilities provided a comprehensive framework for film certification. 
 

PART C

C. LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK 
11. 
We have heard Mr Sanjoy Ghose, senior counsel and Mr Jai Anant 
Dehadrai, counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant; Mr Parag Tripathi, senior 
counsel appearing on behalf of Sony Pictures and Mr Tushar Mehta, Solicitor 
General of India who has appeared to assist the Court on its request. The issues 
that arise for our consideration include the impact of the provisions of the RPwD 
Act 2016 on the certification of films under the Cinematograph Act.  
12. 
The appellant has alleged that the Board has violated its duties under the 
statute for film certification in granting a certificate to the film. The Cinematograph 
Act 1952, the Cinematograph (Certification) Rules 19834 and the Guidelines for 
Certification of Films for Public Exhibition 19915, constitute the framework for 
certification of films. These provide for certification of films for exhibition and for 
regulation of the exhibition of such films. Every film must obtain a prior certificate 
for exhibition   from the Board under Section 5A of the Act. The Board is 
constituted under Section 3 by the Central Government and consists of a 
chairperson and a minimum of twelve, and a maximum of twenty-five members6.  
An application for the grant of a certificate has to be   in the format prescribed in 
the Rules7.  
13. 
Once an application is made, it is assessed by an Examining Committee, 
which makes recommendations to the relevant authority, which could be the 
Chairperson of the Board or the Regional Officer concerned. The authority, acting 
 
4 “1983 Rules”. The 1983 Rules have been superseded by the Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 2024 
(“2024 Rules”).  
5 “Guidelines” 
6 Cinematograph Act 1952, Section 3.  
7 Cinematograph Act 1952, Section 4; Cinematograph (Certification) Rules 1983, Rule 21.   

PART C  
8 
 
on the Board’s behalf may act on the recommendations or refer the application to 
the Revising Committee which includes members of the Board or of advisory 
panels.8  
14. 
Section 5 provides for Advisory Panels9  consisting of persons qualified to 
judge the effect of the films on the public. The Advisory panels are appointed to 
facilitate the efficient functioning of the Board. The Board may consult the panel 
in respect of any application for the certification of a film. The panel has to 
examine the film and make its recommendations to the Board in accordance with 
the applicable rules. 
15. 
Section 8 empowers the Central Government to make rules. The 1983 
Certification Rules (and the 2024 Rules which superseded them) were framed 
under the rule making power. Under the Rules, the Regional Officer appoints an 
Examining Committee consisting of members of the Advisory Panel (constituted 
under Section 5) and an Examining Officer10. The Examining Officer submits 
recommendations of the Examining Committee to the authority prescribed in the 
Rules, based on the type and length of the content, and takes personal 
responsibility for compliance with every guideline.11 The Chairperson of the Board 
can require the Regional Officer to act on behalf of the Board, in conformity with 
the recommendations of the Examining Committee.  The Chairperson may, in the 
alternative, on their own motion or on a request by the applicant, refer the record 
to the Revising Committee under Rule 24. The Revising Committee shall

11 ibid, Rule 22 (13).  

PART C  
9 
 
examine the film and send the recommendations to the Chairperson of the Board. 
If the Chairperson disagrees with the decision by majority of the Revising 
Committee, the Board shall itself examine the film or cause the film to be 
examined again by another Revising Committee and the decision of the Board or 
a second Revising Committee, as the case may be, shall be final.12 The 
certificate granted by the Board is published in the Gazette is valid for 10 years.13  
16. 
The Board may sanction the film for unrestricted public exhibition (‘U’ 
certificate); public exhibition restricted to adults (‘A’ certificate); (U/A certificate); or 
public exhibition restricted to members of a class, having regard to the nature, 
content and theme of the film (‘S’ certificate). The Board may certify the film as it 
is, or subject to excisions or modifications or refuse to sanction the film for public 
exhibition altogether.  
17. 
Section 5B provides that a film shall not be certified if in the opinion of the 
Board, it is against “the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the 
security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency 
or morality, or involves defamation or contempt of court or is likely to incite the 
commission of any offence.” Section 5B(2) states that the Central Government 
may delineate principles to guide the authority granting a certificate for public 
exhibition of films. Accordingly, Guidelines have been framed in 1991.  
 
 
 
12 ibid, Rule 24. 
13 ibid, Rule 29.  

PART C  
10 
 
I. The 1991 Guidelines 
 
18. 
The appellant states that the egregious portrayal of characters with 
disabilities in the film necessitates judicially mandated checks and the framing of 
guidelines for creators of content. The Guidelines, framed under Section 5B of 
the Cinematograph Act, are interpreted as broad standards and require (inter 
alia) that the Board must ensure that scenes showing abuse of physically or 
mentally handicapped persons are not presented needlessly.14 The guidelines 
prescribe sensitive portrayal of women, children and persons with disabilities.15 
The film must be examined as a whole and in line with contemporary standards 
of the country and the people to whom it relates. 
19. 
This Court has laid down tests to determine challenges to the portrayal of 
persons, situations and characters in films. The aversion defence states that the 
portrayal of a social evil meant to arouse revulsion, such as scenes of sexual 
violence or communal tension, are meant to draw attention to these evils rather 
than to glorify them. They must not be barred for mere portrayal and due regard 
must be had to the overall message of the film, rather than standalone scenes.16 
Films must remain sensitive to standards of society and alive to social changes.17 
The Board is required to view the film as a whole in applying the above metrics. 
The decision must not be based on isolated bits and scenes in the film.18

PART C  
11 
 
20. Once certified, the film is presumed to have complied with the applicable Rules 
and Guidelines, and its effect on the public cannot ordinarily be re-assessed by 
the Court, having already been considered by an expert body19.  
21. The certification of the film in question is not in issue before us. In that regard, as 
the High Court has noted, the appellant has not contested Sony Pictures’ reply to 
their legal notice. During the course of the hearing it was stated across the Bar 
that since the film has been released in the meantime, the certification itself is not 
seriously in challenge. The appellant has sought the framing of guidelines and 
inclusion of recommendations for creators to follow while dealing with sensitive 
subjects such as the rights of persons with disabilities in the visual media.  
II. Article 19(1)(a) and The Cinematograph Act  
 
22. A filmmaker’s right to exhibit films is a part of their fundamental right to freedom 
of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a), which is subject to reasonable 
restrictions under Article 19(2)20. The Cinematograph Act is an instance of 
reasonable restrictions on this right under the ‘decency and morality’ rubric of 
Article 19(2).21 Prior certification  under the Act has been regarded as a  valid 
restraint on cinematic speech because of its ‘instant appeal’ and the ability to stir 
emotions more deeply than other artistic media.22 Even so, like restraints on

20 19. Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech, etc. 
(1) All citizens shall have the right-(a)to freedom of speech and expression;  
(2)Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law, or prevent the State 
from making any law, in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right 
conferred by the said sub-clause in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the 
State, friendly relations with Foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of 
court, defamation or incitement to an offence.

22 KA Abbas (supra) [20,34].  

PART C  
12 
 
cinematic speech have to be  narrowly  construed because of their  potential to 
imperil the significant value of free speech which is a constitutionally protected 
value. 
23. In KA Abbas v. Union of India 23, this Court underlined that restraints on 
cinematic expression have to be extremely narrow.24 The Court held that when 
determining the effect of a film, the Board must view it from the vantage of an 
ordinary person of common sense rather than a hypersensitive person. Moreover, 
the Board must be alive to social change and must not adopt a conservative or 
orthodox approach. The limits on expression must be ‘necessary’, rather than 
merely expedient or convenient, which are relatively lower thresholds.25 The 
Board must make a “substantial allowance” in favour of freedom and allow 
creative works to interpret both the foibles as well as the good in the society.26  
24. Since the Cinematograph Act provides for an elaborate procedure for certification 
of films by expert bodies, the approval of the statutory committees such as the 
Examination Committee must be given due weight. The Board has the benefit of 
hearing the perspective of the filmmakers, who make relevant representations 
before the Board.  Courts are slow to interfere with the conclusions of specialised 
bodies, constituted under the Act.27 In this narrow scope of intervention, the Court 
may not act like a film critic and must observe certain grounding principles. For 
instance, the mere mention of a subject in the film is not problematic in itself and 
a deeper examination of the manner in which the theme has been handled is

required.28 In Bobby Art International v. Om Pal Singh Hoon29,  this Court held 
that as long as the overall message of the film is not to extol a social evil, its mere 
depiction of a social evil is not impermissible. It was held there that the portrayal 
of sexual violence could not be construed as a promotion of such violence.30 In 
Nachiketa Walhekar v. Central Board of Film Certification31, a three-judge 
bench speaking through one of us (Dr DY Chandrachud J) refused to stay the 
release of a film on the ground of its apprehended use as evidence in a pending 
trial. It was held that the Court will be extremely slow to restrain creative works, 
once the Board had approved exhibition.32 
25. Restraints on films are  founded on principles of due process, social interest, 
limited application in cases of absolute necessity and clear purpose of the 
restraint.33 Among the  principles which  must be borne in mind when deciding 
the fitness of a film for public exhibition include the following: (i) Social impact of 
the film is judged from the perspective of an ordinary person of reasonable 
intelligence and not a hypersensitive person; (iii) Social change, rather than 
orthodox notions or what is right and moral must be borne in mind; and (iv) The  
film must be judged by its overall message and not from isolated depictions of 
social evils.

PART D

D. THE CONTEXT OF SPEECH  
26. We are dealing with cinematic speech. In a slightly different context of anti-hate 
speech and group-defamation laws, Professor Ronald Dworkin argued that 
freedom of speech and expression extended even to hate speech. While he 
conceded the need to protect certain groups from violence and discrimination, he 
believed society could adopt laws to offer such protection. He regarded hate 
speech as protected speech and necessary, so that anti-discrimination laws could 
gain political legitimacy and enforceability among their opponents. His argument 
was that “if we want legitimate laws against violence or discrimination, we must 
let their opponents speak”.34 John Stuart Mill on the other hand, argued that such 
speech served a public-education function by promoting public debate, and to 
sustain constant questioning of the truth35. Disagreeing with Dworkin’s legitimacy 
argument as well as Mill’s public debate argument, Jeremy Waldron argued in 
The Harm in Hate Speech that on certain issues, society is past the point where it 
needs to debate fundamental aspects of issues such as race. Waldron argued 
that if hate speech were to be allowed because of its ability to sustain a public 
debate, such debate would come at the cost of the dignity of racial minorities, 
who have had to bear humiliating attacks on their objective social standing due to 
such speech.36 This affront to one’s dignity and objective treatment by society,

rather than the more subjective notion of the ‘effect on one’s feelings’ by way of 
such speech must be curbed.37 
27. Even though Waldron was writing in a different context, he highlights the 
importance of the ‘context’ of speech as paramount in deciding the validity of 
restraints on it. Derogatory speech and stereotypes usually target the 
marginalised. The impact of the speech on human dignity; the identity of the 
speaker and the target; and the linguistic connotations of the speech may be 
considered in deciding issues around stereotypical speech. The standard of the 
‘overall message’ of a film, in some ways, furthers this emphasis on the 
importance of context and manner of portrayal in visual media.38    
I. Disabling imagery: stereotypical portrayal of persons with disabilities in the 
media.  
28. Media portrayals of persons with disabilities have been historically oppressive. 
Consistent with the understanding that disability was ‘anomalous’ in a normative 
framework of ability, persons with disabilities were represented in disparaging 
ways. They were portrayed as evil, as objects of pity, violence, curiosity and 
ridicule, as burdens on society, sexually abnormal, and overall, as people 
incapable of community participation39. Such disabling imagery formed “the 
 
37  Jeremy Waldron (supra), Pgs 107,197 “I think we do need to ask whether we are past the stage where 
society is in such need of a robust debate about fundamental matters of race that we ought to bear the 
costs of what amount to attacks on the dignity of minority groups. Think of what those costs may involve. 
Are we re ally in need of such robust debate on racial ontology that we have no choice but to require 
individuals and families within minority groups to bear the costs of such humiliating attacks on their social 
standing?”

bedrock on which the attitudes towards, assumptions about and expectations of 
disabled persons are based”40. Such portrayal perpetuated stigmatising views 
about disability as a vulnerability or a ‘suffering’.41 Recurrent negative portrayals 
as illustrated above and frequent use of patronising and offensive language such 
as “victim”, “differently abled”, or “unfortunate” to describe individuals continue to 
perpetuate negative attitudes towards persons with disabilities.  
29. The problem with such portrayal is that it channels attention on the medical 
aspects of impairment rather than the social aspects that actually disable a 
person. This impacts persons with disabilities as individuals as well, subjecting 
them to stigma and social exclusion.42  
30. As Allan Sutherland wrote, “stereotyped views frequently act as self-fulfilling 
prophecies, forcing the person with a disability into a role that can then be used 
to justify the original treatment.”43 They shape and strengthen the already existing 
negative assumptions about their abilities44. This resultantly exacerbates 
systemic inequalities, and inhibits their dignified participation in the public sphere 
for education or employment.45  
31. Humour is a powerful medium of speech that can reinforce attitudes and 
influence behaviour towards groups. Pejorative jokes may reinforce stereotypical 
assumptions about disabilities, validating abusive attitudes and practices towards

persons with disabilities.46 Humour, however, also has a complex dual role for 
persons with disabilities. It could be “both liberating and stigmatising” depending 
on the context of the joke and who is telling it.47 We shall advert to this dual role 
later. 
II. Stereotyping as an anti-thesis to dignity and non-discrimination.  
32. This Court is cognisant of the impact of stereotypes on discrimination and the 
enjoyment of fundamental rights. We have traced safeguards against 
stereotyping to the anti-discrimination code under Article 15, the right to dignity 
and to equality.  
33. For instance, in Anuj Garg v. Hotel Association of India,48 this Court struck 
down a law that barred women’s employment in premises where liquor was 
consumed. Such an indirectly discriminatory law was held to be inflicted by 
“incurable fixations of stereotype morality and conceptions of sexual role”.49 In 
Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India,50 this Court found that Section 377 of the 
Indian Penal Code was discriminatory and premised on stereotypes about binary 
genders and the role of sex. It singled out a class of people on a basis proscribed 
under Article 15(1)51. A provision that was based on and perpetuated stereotypes 
deprived certain individuals of their right to equal participation as citizens and

equal enjoyment of life.52 In Indian Young Lawyers Association v. State of 
Kerala53, a Constitution Bench of which one of us was a part (Dr DY 
Chandrachud), found that stereotypes about sex undercut dignity. The 
paternalistic notion that women were a weaker sex was found to be contrary to 
the dignity of women (inter alia) and as such, impermissible.54 The Constitution 
envisions dignity, liberty and equality as imperatives for a dignified society. The 
“dehumanising effect of stereotypes” has been recognised by this Court in 
upholding the rights of those at the receiving end of these prejudicial notions and 
biases.55  
III. The Framework of the RPwD Act, 2016 
  
34. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, inspired by the Social Model of 
Disability, marks a significant legislative step forward. This model, which gained 
prominence after the American Civil Rights Movement, uses the term "person 
with disability" instead of "disabled person," emphasizing the individuality of 
people rather than their disabilities. According to the Social model, disability 
arises not from a person’s impairments but from the artificial barriers imposed by 
society and the environment.  
35. The RPwD Act defines a person with a disability as someone with a long-term 
physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairment that, in interaction with

societal barriers, hinders their full and effective participation in society on an 
equal basis with others56. 
36. For the first time, the 2001 Census counted people with disabilities. This inclusion 
marked a step towards recognizing persons with disabilities as a distinct group 
deserving of rights tailored to their needs. Earlier efforts, such as the Mental 
Health Act of 1987 and the establishment of the Rehabilitation Council of India in 
1986, laid the groundwork for these advancements. The 1995 Persons with 
Disabilities Act further propelled the Disability Rights Movement by addressing 
early detection, education, employment, affirmative action, non-discrimination, 
and barrier-free access.57 
37. Years of advocacy culminated in the enactment of the RPwD Act 2016, aligning 
Indian law with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities58.  
The Act embodies principles of dignity, individual autonomy (freedom to make 
personal choices), non-discrimination, and effective participation. The CRPD 
asserts that disability arises from the interaction between impairments and social 
attitudes, creating barriers to full and equal participation in society. 
38. The RPwD Act represents a fundamental shift from viewing disability through a 
charity lens to a human rights perspective. Its core aim is to empower persons 
with disabilities by upholding their inherent dignity and autonomy. The Act broadly 
underscores principles of non-discrimination, full and effective participation in 
society, and the inclusion of all individuals, emphasizing the respect for 
differences and the acceptance of disabilities as an integral part of human

diversity. It enshrines equality of opportunity, accessibility, gender equality, and 
the recognition of the evolving capacities of children with disabilities, ensuring 
their right to maintain their identities. 
39. Section 3(1) of the RPwD Act mandates that the appropriate government ensure 
persons with disabilities enjoy the right to equality, life with dignity, and respect for 
their integrity on par with others.59 The Act comprehensively prohibits 
discrimination against persons with disabilities in various spheres, including 
employment, education, access to public places, and provision of goods and 
services. It asserts that no person with a disability shall be deprived of any right 
or benefit available to others. This legislative framework reinforces the 
commitment of the Act to fostering a society that respects and upholds the rights 
of all individuals, regardless of disability status, thereby promoting inclusivity and 
societal harmony. 
IV. International Jurisprudence 
 
40. The human rights approach to disability has evolved over the latter half of the 
20th century, incorporating disability into a broader paradigm of rights that began 
with the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. This 
declaration acknowledged that all individuals have civil, political, economic, 
 
59 Section 3. Equality and non-discrimination.— 
(1) The appropriate Government shall ensure that the persons with disabilities enjoy the right to equality, 
life with dignity and respect for his or her integrity equally with others.  
(2) The appropriate Government shall take steps to utilise the capacity of persons with disabilities by 
providing appropriate environment.  
(3) No person with disability shall be discriminated on the ground of disability, unless it is shown that the 
impugned act or omission is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. 
 (4) No person shall be deprived of his or her personal liberty only on the ground of disability. 8 (5) The 
appropriate Government shall take necessary steps to ensure reasonable accommodation for persons with 
disabilities. 

PART D

social, cultural, and development rights, despite their differences.60 From this 
viewpoint, disability is seen as a variation in human characteristics, enriching the 
diversity of societal contributions and requiring mechanisms to ensure individuals 
can realize their potential.61 
41. This rights-based perspective views people with disabilities as subjects rather 
than objects, shifting from seeing them as problems to recognizing them as rights 
holders. Since the mid-1970s, this perspective has manifested in four ways at the 
UN level: through non-binding declarations and resolutions, in the interpretation 
of general human rights treaties, in the drafting of thematic human rights treaties, 
and in the ongoing work of specialized agencies. The CRPD aims to promote, 
protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms by persons with disabilities, emphasizing respect for their 
inherent dignity. The Convention does not create new rights but expresses 
existing rights in a way that addresses the needs of PWDs.  
42. A Committee monitors the implementation of the Convention. Countries that ratify 
it, including India (in 2007), must report regularly on their progress. The 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development also pledges to "leave no one behind," 
asserting that persons with disabilities must be both beneficiaries and agents of 
change.

PART D  
22 
 
1. Equality and Non-Discrimination   
 
43. Equality and non-discrimination are fundamental to all human rights treaties. The 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights prohibit discrimination on 
various grounds, forming the basis for Article 5 of the CRPD.62  Thematic UN 
human rights conventions aim to establish equality and eliminate discrimination, 
with provisions specifically addressing these principles. The CRPD builds on the 
experiences of other conventions, evolving the UN's approach to equality and 
non-discrimination. 
44. The CRPD Committee routinely observes several forms of discrimination against 
persons with disabilities, including violations in accessing the built environment, 
transportation, information, and communications; negative portrayals and harmful 
stereotypes in the media; deprivation of the right to legal capacity; barriers to 
accessing justice, education, and employment; and restrictions on participating in 
cultural life, recreation, leisure, and sports.63 Despite the adoption and ratification 
of the CRPD by many countries, disability-based discrimination persists due to 
continued reliance on charity and medical paradigms. In light of the foregoing 
considerations, it is evident that there exist outdated approaches to addressing 
 
62 Article 5 - Equality And Non-Discrimination 
1. States Parties recognize that all persons are equal before and under the law and are entitled 
without any discrimination to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law. 
2. States Parties shall prohibit all discrimination on the basis of disability and guarantee to persons 
with disabilities equal and effective legal protection against discrimination on all grounds. 
3. In order to promote equality and eliminate discrimination, States Parties shall take all 
appropriate steps to ensure that reasonable accommodation is provided. 
4. Specific measures which are necessary to accelerate or achieve de facto equality of persons 
with disabilities shall not be considered discrimination under the terms of the present Convention.

disability, which fail to acknowledge individuals with disabilities as full rights 
holders.64  These approaches, characterized by a desire to "care for and protect" 
persons with disabilities or to "fix" or "cure" them, are fundamentally incompatible 
with the principles of equality and non-discrimination enshrined in the CRPD.  
45. The General Comment on Article 5 of the CRPD states that state parties should 
take proactive measures to address discriminatory portrayals of persons with 
disabilities in the media. 65 Such portrayals, rooted in charity, welfare, and 
medical paradigms, perpetuate harmful stereotypes and undermine the dignity 
and autonomy of individuals with disabilities. States must therefore implement 
measures to encourage the media to portray persons with disabilities in a manner 
consistent with the CRPD, thereby combating negative views that depict them as 
dependent or lacking autonomy. 
46. The human rights approach to disability has been highlighted in many 
international cases. In Glor v. Switzerland66, the European Court of Human 
Rights declared a European and worldwide consensus on protecting persons with 
disabilities against discrimination, referencing the CRPD.  In this case, the 
applicant, deemed unfit for military service due to diabetes, was still taxed for not 
performing military service.67  The court held that Switzerland had unlawfully 
discriminated against him. In Bacher v. Austria68, the applicant, with autism and 
Down Syndrome, faced accessibility issues when a wooden roof crucial for 
accessing his home was destroyed.  The CRPD Committee noted that states

must ensure equal access for Persons with Disabilities to public goods, products, 
and services in a manner that respects dignity.  69 
47. The human rights approach to disability, reflected in the CRPD, represents a 
significant evolution in international human rights law. It emphasizes the need to 
treat persons with disabilities as rights holders, ensuring their full participation 
and inclusion in society. 
2. Awareness-raising  
 
48. Article 8 of the CRPD mandates measures for raising awareness about disability 
rights,70 including:  
 
69 Ibid. Para 9.9.  
 
70 Article 8 – Awareness-raising 
1. States Parties undertake to adopt immediate, effective and appropriate measures: 
a) To raise awareness throughout society, including at the family level, regarding persons with disabilities, 
and to foster respect for the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities; 
b) To combat stereotypes, prejudices and harmful practices relating to persons with disabilities, including 
those based on sex and age, in all areas of life; 
c) To promote awareness of the capabilities and contributions of persons with disabilities. 
2. Measures to this end include: 
a) Initiating and maintaining effective public awareness campaigns designed: 
i. To nurture receptiveness to the rights of persons with disabilities; 
ii. To promote positive perceptions and greater social awareness towards persons with disabilities; 
iii. To promote recognition of the skills, merits and abilities of persons with disabilities, and of their 
contributions to the workplace and the labour market; 
b) Fostering at all levels of the education system, including in all children from an early age, an attitude of 
respect for the rights of persons with disabilities; 
c) Encouraging all organs of the media to portray persons with disabilities in a manner consistent with the 
purpose of the present Convention; 
d) Promoting awareness-training programmes regarding persons with disabilities and the rights of persons 
with disabilities.

i. 
Raising awareness at all levels of society, starting from families, to instill 
respect for disability rights and dignity; 
ii. 
Fighting stereotypes and prejudices against persons with disabilities in 
various life domains, regardless of sex or age; and 
iii. 
Promoting recognition of the abilities and valuable contributions of persons 
with disabilities. 
49. Awareness-raising campaigns targeting both the public and private sectors are 
essential for combating stereotypes, prejudices, and harmful practices relating to 
persons with disabilities.71  These campaigns should address misconceptions 
that individuals with disabilities, such as autistic persons, deaf persons, blind 
persons, and persons with psychosocial disabilities, are less likely to interact with 
colleagues or be more productive due to fewer distractions. It is crucial to identify 
and eliminate value systems like ableism that underpin legislation, policies, and 
practices leading to inequality and discrimination.  
50. Article 4.3 is significant for raising awareness.72 The CRPD Committee 
recommends that States parties implement systematic awareness-raising 
programs with the participation of Disabled Persons' Organizations73 and 
Organizations of Persons with Disabilities.74 This is articulated in the General 
Comment 7 on Articles 4.3 and 33.3 which talk about the participation of persons

Rights Monitors Professional Training Series No. 17 ( 2010).

72 Art 4 (2) CRPD states that: “With regard to economic, social and cultural rights, each State Party 
undertakes to take measures to the maximum of its available resources and, where needed, within the 
framework of international cooperation, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of these 
rights, without prejudice to those obligations contained in the present convention that are immediately 
applicable according to international law.”

with disabilities in the implementation and monitoring of the Convention75. The 
Comment states that these programs should include media campaigns that 
portray positive images of persons with disabilities, especially those with 
albinism, psychosocial and/or intellectual disabilities, and deaf-blind persons, as 
human rights holders.  76 
51. Stereotypes, ableism, and misconceptions that prevent independent living for 
persons with disabilities must be eradicated, promoting a positive image of their 
contributions to society. Training programs for public-sector officials must align 
with the principles of the CRPD and the human rights model of disability to 
overcome entrenched gender and disability stereotypes. Awareness-raising 
should involve authorities, civil servants, professionals, the media, the general 
public, and persons with disabilities and their families, and should be carried out 
in close cooperation with representative organizations of persons with disabilities.  
52. The CRPD requires member states to "closely consult with" and "actively involve" 
persons with disabilities through their organizations in the development and 
implementation of awareness-raising campaigns.77  This is crucial for shifting the 
perception of persons with disabilities from "objects of charity" to "rights holders." 
While awareness creation is not a right per se, the Convention obliges States 
parties to raise awareness about the rights of persons with disabilities. 
Establishing a right is different from ensuring its realization, which is why State 
parties must provide an enabling environment for persons with disabilities to fully

enjoy their rights. The media's power to shape attitudes and create awareness is 
a vital component of this enabling environment.  
53. The CRPD emphasizes respect for difference and acceptance of persons with 
disabilities as part of human diversity. It aims to prevent discrimination rather than 
disability, shifting the focus from a medical approach to a rights-based approach. 
This perspective should also guide public service campaigns related to public 
safety and health, ensuring they respect diversity and combat discrimination. 
54. The World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons78 , adopted in 
1982, promotes disability from a human rights perspective and provides 
recommendations for national, regional, and international action.79  It encourages 
developing media guidelines in consultation with disability organizations, training 
in self-advocacy for persons with disabilities, and informed education and training 
within the media sector to improve disability portrayal.80 The guidelines should 
promote sensitive and accurate portrayals of persons with disabilities across 
various media forms, not just news media. 
55. In line with the WPA, the United Nations developed guidelines for the inclusion 
and portrayal of disabled people in the media, culminating in the booklet titled 
"Improving Communications about People with Disabilities."  81These guidelines, 
designed to be adaptable across different media and countries, aim to improve 
public perception of persons with disabilities. They cover topics such as inclusion

of Disabled Persons, 1983-1992. See also Paul Harpur, ‘From Disability to ability: changing the phrasing of

in mainstream programming, portrayal and depiction issues, the use of language, 
and participation of persons with disabilities in media production.82 
56. While the guidelines from the WPA provide effective measures for improving 
media portrayal, they are outdated in some respects, particularly their medical-
based understanding of disability. For instance, they include recommendations on 
preventing and treating impairments, which may contradict the CRPD's principle 
of respecting disability as part of human diversity.  However, the guidelines' 
promotion, availability, and monitoring mechanisms remain valuable for 
encouraging accurate and positive media representations of persons with 
disabilities. 
V. 
Indian jurisprudence aligns with the human rights approach.  
 
57. The foundation of laws for persons with disabilities has been traced to the 
guarantee of dignity as a core human right, recognised by the Constitution under 
Article 2183. The Scheme of the 2016 Act, as opposed to the preceding 1995 Act, 
is not constrained by the availability of resources, but recognises positive 
obligations of the State to materialise these rights housed in its various 
provisions.84  
58. This Court has held in Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service Commission85 
that while not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, persons with disabilities 
are equally entitled to the rights enumerated therein. We recognised that the 
RPwD Act provisions create a protective ambit which encompasses equality, non-

discrimination and dignity. Section 3 of the Act casts an affirmative obligation on 
the government to enable the exercise of rights including the right to equality and 
dignity, which vest in persons with disabilities with equal rigour as others.86 This 
Court underlined the positive obligation of both State and private parties to 
provide support to persons with disabilities to facilitate their full and effective 
participation in society. The RPwD Act, we noted, was more than an anti-
discrimination legislation. It emphasized creation of an environment conducive to 
the above-mentioned rights including substantive equality and opportunity to 
participate in society.87 This ruling reinforced the obligation of the State and of 
private entities to support full participation in society, aligning with the CRPD’s 
human rights model of disability.  
59. This approach was further demonstrated in Ravindra Kumar Dhariwal v. Union 
of India88, where this Court addressed the discrimination faced by a Central 
Reserve Police Force Assistant Commandant who developed a mental disability 
during service. The Court emphasized 'dignity' and 'equality' under Section 3 of 
the RPWD Act, highlighting the State's positive duty to protect the rights of 
persons with disabilities.  
60. Recent rulings reflect the judiciary's evolving role in not only safeguarding 
individual rights but also in addressing the complex intersections of disability, 
gender and mental health, enriching the discourse on equality. This perspective 
rejects a one-size-fits-all approach, acknowledging that disability is a nuanced, 
individualized concept shaped by factors such as mental impairment and

personal circumstances. The legal framework stresses the need to prevent 
stigmatization and discrimination against individuals with disabilities, recognizing 
the profound impact on their sense of identity and dignity. 
61. The 2016 Act came much after the 1991 Guidelines. The Guidelines include the 
Board’s duty to protect against ‘needlessly’ abusive and ridiculing scenes about 
persons with disabilities. In view of the instant appeal of visual media, this 
guideline furthers the goal of creating an environment conducive to inclusive and 
substantive equality in the context of their historically oppressive social treatment. 
The certificate entails a presumption that the film complies with the Guidelines. In 
this instance, the film was granted a ‘U’ – certificate and it implies that it does not 
needlessly portray persons with disabilities in a manner contrary to the guidelines 
and statutes governing the field.  
 
E. SPEECH MUST NOT PREJUDICE THE MARGINALISED AND DISENFRANCHISE THEM 
FURTHER.  
62. Article 19(1)(a) has been termed as “perhaps the most precious of all the 
freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution”.89 Speech and expression form a 
crucial part of the democratic give and take90 and serve as a corrective check on 
public policy.91 Overall, they promote the discursive health of democracy92. Social 
debate must be enriched by diverse voices and wide participation from across the

social spectrum.93 Unfortunately, normative stereotypes about gender, identity, 
sexual orientation and disability have hitherto deprived certain groups of such 
participation. In Indibly Creative (supra), we held that while satirical speech 
effectively exposed social absurdities, hypocrisies and contradictions, even such 
expression was subject to Article 19(2). This Court had remarked that if such 
expression, which is otherwise acceptable because it promotes discourse, targets 
the society’s marginalised, it may “confirm and strengthen people's prejudices 
against the group in question, which only marginalises and disenfranchises them 
more”.94 Such expression, it was held, may not enjoy the complete protection of 
Article 19(1)(a).  
F. CAVEAT: DISABILITY HUMOUR V. DISABLING HUMOUR.  
63. In the context of historically oppressive representation of persons with disabilities, 
speech that entrenches stereotypes is opposed to the dignity of such individuals. 
However, not all speech that uses stereotypes commonly employed against 
persons with disabilities is abhorrent by reason of such use alone. As stated in 
the preceding sections, the context, intention and the overall message must be 
considered before such use may be termed as prejudicial, and the protection of 
free speech lifted.  
64. Humour and disabilities are viewed as uneasy companions. This is primarily 
because of  the  historical use of humour to mock disability,  make jokes at the

expense of persons with disabilities and to use them for comic relief.95 Also, the 
medical model treats disability as a personal ‘tragedy’ which is by definition, 
incompatible with humour.96 This understanding is now obsolete under the social 
model which views disability as a function of social barriers that disable such 
individuals.97  The social model says that stereotypes stem from a lack of 
familiarity with disability. This lack arises due to inadequate representation and 
participation of persons with disabilities in dominant discourse.98  
65. Despite the history and the obsolescence of the medical model, humour is not 
universally denounced in the context of disability. It is now being increasingly 
used as a sophisticated literary medium for engagement with the society by 
persons with disabilities. It familiarises the society with the lived experiences of 
persons with disability, thereby dispelling prejudicial myths, and sensitising 
people.99 Challenging notions of ‘otherness’ or ‘inferiority’ associated with 
persons with disability, humour creates an equal space.100  Comics with 
disabilities use self-deprecating humour to critique the social order and counter 
stereotypical images101. They bring stereotypes to the fore and rely on them in

66. We must therefore, distinguish ‘disabling humour’ that demeans and disparages 
persons with disability from ‘disability humour’ which challenges conventional 
wisdom about disability. While disability humour attempts to better understand 
and explain disability, disabling humour denigrates it.104 The two cannot be 
equated in their impact on dignity and on stereotypes about persons with 
disabilities105.

respectively. The High Court noted at paragraph 8 of the judgment that since the

message of the film was about resilience of persons with disability, the  primary 
challenge that the film offended the sensibilities was not established. The

make you feel empathy, closeness, understanding. • Does it tell you "they" are irrevocably different, make 
you feel more distant from "them", give the impression they are somehow less than human,

presence of a person with this disability?

countervailing right of freedom of speech and expression of the filmmaker as 
stated in the previous sections was not weighed against the rights claimed by the 
appellant. The High Court could have found that the two rights – the freedom of 
speech and expression of the filmmaker on the one hand and the rights of 
persons with disabilities need not be balanced because the rights in question 
(dignity, non-discrimination and equality) do not include the right to curb the 
filmmakers’ rights to exhibit a film duly certified for such exhibition106. In the 
alternative, the High Court could have undertaken a balancing of the two rights 
according to the single or the double proportionality test- depending on whether it 
felt one of the rights took precedence over the other.107  
69. The High Court rightly does not engage in this discussion perhaps because the 
appellant expressed satisfaction with a direction for inclusion of expert members 
to the Board and the Advisory Panel and because the certification of the film was 
not in issue. Therefore, limiting its inquiry to whether such relief could be granted, 
the High Court decided against the appellant. 
70. In line with the observation in Indibly (supra), we are of the view that the freedom 
under Article 19(1)(a), that is the creative freedom of the filmmaker cannot 
include the freedom to lampoon, stereotype, misrepresent or disparage those 
already marginalised. There is a difference between a film that is set in the 
backdrop of communal violence and which cannot eschew depiction of violence 
from portrayal that outright extols such violence.108 Similarly, if the overall 
message of the work infringes the rights of persons with disabilities, it is not

protected speech, obviating the need for any balancing. However, in appropriate 
cases, if stereotypical/disparaging portrayal is justified by the overall message of 
the film, the filmmaker’s right to retain such portrayal will have to be balanced 
against the fundamental and statutory rights of those portrayed.  
71. The appellant seeks guidelines against filmmakers, regarding the provisions of 
the RPwD Act and the composition of the Board and the Advisory panel under the 
Cinematograph Act and recommendations to beep certain parts of the present 
film as well.  
 
72. Regarding specific recommendations, our views are summarised as follows:  
 
72.1. We endorse slow interference with the determination of an expert body 
under the Cinematograph Act, particularly to allow the exhibition of a film. It 
is for the Board to draw the line between permissible and impermissible 
portrayal of social ills through visual media, and ensure that the Guidelines 
are meant to be read as broad standards for the same.109 The certification in 
the present case implies that the Board found that the overall message of 
the film was in accordance with the guidelines and the RPwD Act.110 We are 
not inclined to interfere with this finding by recommending beeping out parts 
of the film, especially considering the inclusion of a disclaimer in the film.

72.2. The recommendation that Sony Pictures make an awareness film according 
to Section 7 (d) of the RPwD Act cannot be granted.111 Section 7(d) is 
directed towards the appropriate government. While we have underlined 
that the principle of reasonable accommodation includes positive obligations 
of private parties to support persons with disabilities and facilitate their full 
participation, we cannot agree that Section 7(d) includes such an obligation 
against private persons. Even otherwise, such a direction would amount to 
compelled speech. Such compelled speech has been allowed by this Court 
under Article 19(1) of the Constitution, albeit in a very different context from 
the present. A must-carry provision under the Cinematograph Act, mandated 
exhibition of short educational films as a licensing pre-condition for 
exhibitors. The provision was upheld by this Court in Union of India v. 
Motion Pictures Association112. The provision related to exhibition of a 
pre-produced educational short film alongside other films and it applied to 
exhibitors. The recommendation sought in the present case is for creation of 
a whole different film on the ground of a statutory mandate of spreading 
awareness which is not even directed towards a private entity such as Sony 
Pictures. The positive obligation mentioned in Vikash Kumar (supra) cannot 
be so extended to compel speech in the manner suggested by the 
appellant.  
 
72.3. On inclusion of subject matter experts to the Board and advisory panels, we 
believe that the field is sufficiently occupied by the Cinematograph Act and 
 
111 Section 7(d)- appropriate Government shall take protective measures against all forms of abuse, 
violence and exploitation and shall (inter alia) create awareness and make available information among the 
public.

the certification Rules of 1983 and 2024 does not merit our interference. 
Under the 1983 Rules, the Board may take steps to assess public reactions 
to films113. The Examining Committee is supposed to include women as its 
members114.  The 1983 Rules and the 2024 Rules envisage consultation 
with a subject matter expert: the Examining Committee’s final report is 
forwarded to the Chairperson in 10 days, unless the Committee feels that 
expert opinion is necessary. In that case, it may submit a provisional report 
and seek expert opinion before submitting the final report.115 The 2024 
Certification Rules go a step further and provide that a Regional Officer may 
invite subject matter experts for the examination of the film by the 
Examination Committee or Revising Committee116.  
 
72.4. Courts have also placed adequate thrust on the fitness of these expert 
committees to assess legal requirements beyond the Cinematograph Act, 
even with their existing composition.117 In Raj Kapoor v. State118, a two-
judge bench of this Court noted that the certificate, which represented the 
judgment of an expert body selected for judging the fitness of a film for 
public exhibition, also included consideration of the ingredients of other laws 
such as the Indian Penal Code119.  Similarly, in Prakash Jha (supra)120, this 
Court rejected a film ban founded on public order. The Court noted that the

certificate represented the judgment of a body of persons particularly selected under the statute for the 
purpose of adjudging the suitability of films for public exhibition and that judgment extends to a 
consideration of the principal ingredients which go to constitute offences under Sections 292 and 293 of the 
Indian Penal Code.” (emphasis supplied). Also see [Justice Krishna Iyer, 14]

film dealt with a sensitive subject of reservations but it had been duly 
cleared by examining committees comprising legal and subject matter 
experts and members belonging to the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes 
and Other Backward Class communities, who had approved the screening 
of the film. 
 
72.5. The Board must decide whether a disparaging portrayal stood redeemed by 
the overall message or not. No doubt this entails a complex balancing of 
interests as we noted at the outset. It would be ideal if the statutory bodies 
included subject matter experts. We believe the 2024 Rules are a welcome 
acknowledgment of this principle and consultations with subject matter 
experts on disability would certainly better inform the perspective of the 
Board. The policy underlying the Act and the Rules already accounts for 
expert consultation. This Court cannot interfere merely because it could be 
better or that a better alternative is available, when the legality of such 
policy is not in question.121 The Court cannot read additional requirements 
into unambiguous provisions.122 It is beyond the remit of constitutional courts 
to specify the qualifications or expertise that the constituents of these bodies 
must possess or to direct that such a requirement be legislatively included 
into the statute.123 
 
72.6. The appellant has sought formulation of guidelines to restrict content that 
contravenes the Constitution and the RPwD Act 2016. We have stated 
above that the guidelines under the Act are quite extensive and cover the

field. Such directions are issued to fill legislative gaps.124 If allowed, such 
guidelines would be akin to reading the provisions of one statute that is, the 
RPwD Act 2016 into another statute, that is the Cinematograph Act, even 
though the latter does not suffer from a vacuum on the issue, and the 
statutory expert body is presumed to have account for the effect of the 
former anyway125. Courts cannot trench into policy-making.126 The High 
Court was therefore, justified in not granting the abovementioned reliefs and 
we cannot make recommendations to that effect.  
 
73. Since the issue involves the fundamental rights of persons with disabilities, we 
take this opportunity to provide a framework of the portrayal of persons with 
disabilities in visual media that aligns with the anti-discrimination and dignity-
affirming objectives of the Constitution as well as the RPwD Act. We are 
cognisant that Article 19(2) of the Constitution is exhaustive of the limitations 
that can be applied on the freedom guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a)127. The 
framework we wish to lay down is in line with our findings in Vikash Kumar 
(supra) where we emphasised that the fundamental rights under Part III of the 
Constitution apply with equal rigour to persons with disabilities.  
 
74. The language of our discourse ought to be inclusive rather than alienating. We 
noted in Vikash Kumar (supra), that insensitive language was contrary to the 
dignity of persons with disabilities.128  As long as the overall message of the 
film justifies the depiction of disparaging language being used against persons

with disabilities, it cannot be subjected to restrictions beyond those placed in 
Article 19(2). However, language that disparages persons with disabilities, 
marginalises them further and supplements the disabling barriers in their social 
participation, without the redeeming quality of the overall message of such 
portrayal must be approached with caution. Such representation is problematic 
not because it offends subjective feelings but rather, because it impairs the 
objective societal treatment of the affected groups by society.129 We believe 
that representation of persons with disabilities must regard the objective social 
context of their representation and not marginalise persons with disability:  
(i) Words cultivate institutional discrimination. Terms such as “cripple” and 
“spastic” have come to acquire devalued meanings in societal 
perceptions about persons with disabilities. They contribute to the 
negative self-image and perpetuate discriminatory attitudes and 
practices in society;  
(ii) Language that individualises the impairment and overlooks the 
disabling social barriers (e.g. terms such as “afflicted”, “suffering”, and 
“victim”) should be avoided or adequately flagged as contrary to the 
social model130;  
(iii) Creators must check for accurate representation of a medical condition 
as much as possible. The misleading portrayal of what a condition such 
as night blindness entails may perpetuate misinformation about the 
condition, and entrench stereotypes about persons with such 
impairments, aggravating the disability;  
 
129 Jeremy Waldron (supra).  
130 See Vikash Kumar (supra) [84-86].  

PART G 
42 
 
(iv) Persons with disabilities are under-represented. Average people are 
unaware of the barriers persons with disabilities face. Visual media 
must reflect their lived experiences. Their portrayal must capture the 
multitudes of their lived realities, and should not be a uni-dimensional, 
ableist characterisation;  
(v) Visual media should strive to depict the diverse realities of persons with 
disabilities, showcasing not only their challenges but also their 
successes, talents, and contributions to society. This balanced 
representation can help dispel stereotypes and promote a more 
inclusive understanding of disability. Such portrayals should reflect the 
multifaceted lives of persons with disabilities, emphasizing their roles as 
active community members who contribute meaningfully across various 
spheres of life. By highlighting their achievements and everyday 
experiences, media can shift the narrative from one of limitation to one 
of potential and agency; 
(vi) They should neither be lampooned based on myths (such as, ‘blind 
people bump into objects in their path’) nor presented as ‘super 
cripples’ on the other extreme. This stereotype implies that persons with 
disabilities have extraordinary heroic abilities that merit their dignified 
treatment. For instance, the notion that visually impaired persons have 
enhanced spatial senses may not apply to everyone uniformly. It also 
implies that those who do not have such enhanced superpowers to 
compensate for the visual impairment are somehow less than ideal;  

PART G 
43 
 
(vii) 
Decision-making bodies must bear in mind the values of 
participation. The ‘nothing about us, without us’ principle is based on 
the promotion of participation of persons with disabilities and 
equalisation of opportunities. It must be put to practice in constituting 
statutory committees and inviting expert opinions for assessing the 
overall message of films and their impact on dignity of individuals under 
the Cinematograph Act and Rules;131  
(viii) The CPRD also requires consultation with and involvement of 
persons with disabilities in the implementation of measures to 
encourage portrayal that is consistent with it.132 Collaboration with 
disability advocacy groups can provide invaluable insights and 
guidance on respectful and accurate portrayals, ensuring that content 
aligns with the lived experiences of persons with disabilities; and  
(ix) Training and sensitization programs should be implemented for 
individuals involved in creating visual media content, including writers, 
directors, producers, and actors. These programs should emphasize 
the impact of their portrayals on public perceptions and the lived 
experiences of persons with disabilities. Topics should include the 
principles of the social model of disability, the importance of respectful 
language, and the need for accurate and empathetic representation.
