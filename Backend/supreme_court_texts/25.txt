1.
The appeal is taken up for hearing.
2.
The present appeal challenges the judgment and order
dated 28th November 2022 passed by the Division Bench of
the  High  Court  of  Judicature  at  Patna  in  Letters  Patent
Appeal (LPA) No. 1853 of 2016 in Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case
(CWJC) No. 17585 of 2015, thereby dismissing the appeal
filed by the present appellant.
3.
The facts, in brief, giving rise to the present appeal are
as under:
3.1
On  17th October  2012,  District  Programme  Officer,
Katihar  published  a  notice  for  selection  of  Anganwari
1
Digitally signed by
Narendra Prasad
Date: 2024.01.13
12:42:46 IST
Reason:
Signature Not Verified

Workers/Sevika.  Pursuant to the said notice, the present
appellant as well as respondent No. 8 herein applied for the
said post in the selection process.  The appellant has secured
80.60, whereas respondent No. 8 has secured 48.60 marks.
The appellant was appointed to the post of Anganwari Sevika
on 2nd July 2013.
3.2
Being  aggrieved  and  dissatisfied  with  the  order  of
appointment issued in favour of the appellant, respondent
No.8  submitted  a  representation  before  the  District
Programme Officer,  Katihar praying for cancellation of the
order of appointment dated 2nd July 2013 issued in favour of
the appellant.  She also prayed for a direction to issue an
order of appointment in her favour.  The same came to be
rejected by the District Programme Officer, Katihar vide order
dated  13th November  2014.   Being  aggrieved  thereby,
respondent No. 8 preferred an appeal before the Appellate
Authority  –  Court  of  Joint  Commissioner-cum-Secretary,
Regional  Transport  Authority,  Purnea.   The  Appellate
Authority, vide order dated 30th July 2015, allowed the appeal
filed  by  respondent  No.8  while  setting  aside  the  order  of
appointment  dated  2nd July  2013  issued  in  favour  of  the
2

appellant.  Being aggrieved thereby, the appellant filed a writ
petition  being  CWJC  No.  17585  of  2015  before  the  High
Court of Judicature at Patna.
3.3
The learned Single Judge, vide order dated 23rd August
2016,  dismissed  the  said  writ  petition.   Being  aggrieved
thereby, the appellant filed LPA No.1853 of 2016 in CWJC No.
17585 of 2015 before the learned Division Bench of the High
Court.   The  same  was  also dismissed  vide  the  impugned
order.  Hence, the present appeal.
4.
We  have  heard  Mr.  Shoeb  Alam,  learned  counsel
appearing on behalf of the appellant and Mr. Samir Ali Khan,
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents.
5.
It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the only
ground on which the appellant was held to be disqualified
was that her father was a Panchayat Teacher and he was
drawing a salary of Rs.6,000/- per month.  It is submitted
that  Clause  4.9  of  Anganwari  Sevika  Guidelines,  2011
(hereinafter referred to as “2011 Guidelines”), which imposed
certain restrictions, was found to be in violation of Articles 14
and 16 of the Constitution of India by the High Court vide
order dated 27th September 2022 passed in CWJC No. 13210
3

of 2014.  It is submitted that, however, this has been ignored
by the learned Division Bench. 
6.
Per contra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
State as well as respondent No.8 supported the impugned
judgment and order.
7.
We  find  that both the  learned Single  Judge  and  the
Division  Bench  have  grossly  erred  in  dismissing  the  writ
petition as well as LPA filed by the appellant.
8.
Clause 4.9 of the 2011 Guidelines imposed a restriction
on  such  persons  whose  family  member  or  members  have
secured  appointment  with  the  State  Government  or  any
organization of the State.  The said Clause 4.9 of the 2011
Guidelines came to be challenged before the High Court by
way  of  CWJC  No.  13210  of  2014.   The  High Court,  vide
judgment  and  order  dated  27th September  2022,  after
elaborate discussion, struck down the said Clause 4.9 of the
2011 Guidelines.
9.
The only ground on which the appellant has been non-
suited was that the appellant had not challenged the said
Clause 4.9 of the 2011 Guidelines before the High Court.  We
find that the reasoning as adopted by the learned Division
Bench is totally unsustainable.
4

10.
When the said Clause 4.9 of the 2011 Guidelines was
struck down by the  High Court vide judgment dated 27th
September 2022, it ceased to exist.   As such, it was not
necessary for the appellant to challenge the validity of the
same inasmuch as the same was already held to be invalid by
the very same High Court.  In that view of the matter, we find
that the judgments and orders passed by the learned Single
Judge as well as the Division Bench are not sustainable in
law.
11.
In the result, we pass the following order:
(i)
The appeal is allowed;
(ii)
The  impugned  judgments  and  orders  dated  28th
November 2022 in LPA No. 1853 of 2016 in CWJC No.
17585  and  dated  23rd August  2016  in  CWJC  No.
17585  of  2015,  passed  by  the  High  Court  of
Judicature at Patna are quashed and set aside;
(iii)
The writ petition being CWJC No. 17585 as well as
the appeal being LPA No. 1853 of 2016 filed by the
appellant  before  the  High  Court  of  Judicature  at
Patna are allowed by setting aside the order dated
30th July  2015  passed  by  the  Appellate  Authority;
and
(iv)
The appellant is directed to be reinstated forthwith.

12.
It is further directed that though the appellant would
not be entitled to wages for the period during which she was
out of employment, she would be entitled to continuity in
service for all other purposes.
13.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of in
the above terms.
