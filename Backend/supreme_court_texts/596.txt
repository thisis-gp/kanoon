The appellant-Central Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter 
referred to as the ‘CBI’), on 20.02.2006, registered a Criminal Case 
No. RC3(E)/2006/BS&FC/Mumbai against 19 accused persons on 
the basis of a written complaint made by R. Ravichandran, Chief 
General Manager, Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘SEBI”). The allegation was with 
regard to certain fraudulent activities committed in the Initial Public 
Offering (IPO) of the shares of Yes Bank Ltd., which opened for 
subscription from 15.06.2005 to 21.06.2005. 
4. 
On 21.02.2006, the CBI registered another criminal case being 
Criminal Case No. RC4(E)/2006/CBI/BS&FC/Mumbai against 26 
accused persons on the basis of a similar complaint. This time, it 
pertained to the fraudulent activities committed in the Initial Public 
Offering (IPO) of the shares of Infrastructure Development Finance 
Company Ltd. (IDFC), which opened for subscription from 
15.07.2005 to 22.07.2005. In this First Information Report 
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘FIR’), the respondent was specifically 
named.

5. 
On 29.09.2007, a chargesheet was filed in Criminal Case No. 
RC4(E)/2006/CBI/BS&FC/Mumbai 
after 
completion 
of 
investigation vide Special Case No. 47 of 2007 against 22 accused 
persons including the first respondent herein for offences punishable 
under Section 120-B read with 420, 467, 468 and 471 of IPC and 
Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 
1988 and Section 68-A of The Companies Act, 1956. A 
supplementary chargesheet was also filed in Criminal Case No. 
RC4/E/2006/BS&FC Mumbai which was numbered as Special Case 
No. 74 of 2014 and further 21 accused persons were added with the 
Original 22, totaling 43 accused. 
6. 
Similarly, on 19.10.2007, with regard to Criminal Case No.  
RC3(E)/2006/BS&FC/Mumbai, a chargesheet was filed vide Special 
Case No. 48 of 2007 against 16 accused persons including the first 
respondent under Section 120-B read with 420, 467, 468 and 471 of 
IPC and Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of 
Corruption Act, 1988 and Section 68-A of The Companies Act, 1956. 
Similarly, a supplementary chargesheet was also filed in Criminal 
Case RC3/E/2006/BS&FC/Mumbai which was numbered as Special 

4 
 
Case No. 22 of 2014 and further 9 accused were added, totaling the 
number of accused to 25. 
7. 
On 10th March, 2008, on the basis of the charge-sheet and 
material produced before the Special Court CBI, the said Court took 
cognizance against the accused persons including the respondent for 
the offences mentioned above in Special Case No. 47 of 2007. 
Similarly, on 19.03.2008, on the basis of the charge-sheet and 
material produced by the CBI, the Special Court CBI took 
Cognizance against the accused persons including the respondent for 
the offences mentioned above in Special Case No. 48 of 2007. 
8. 
In the meantime, the respondent approached SEBI for a consent 
order in terms of SEBI Circular No. EFD/ED/Cir-1/2007 and on 
04.09.2009, the High-Powered Advisory Committee of SEBI in 
terms of the Circular directed the respondent to pay Rs. 2,05,18,968/- 
being the unjust profit made by the respondent and Rs. 20,51,897/- 
being a percentage of the disgorged amount towards settlement 
charges. The respondent paid the said amount. On 07.12.2009, SEBI 

5 
 
passed the consent order disposing of the proceedings under Section 
11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992. 
9.   It is at this stage that the respondent approached the High Court 
by filing Writ Petition No. 406 of 2018 under Article 226 read with 
Section 482 Cr.P.C.  The said Writ Petition was disposed of by the 
Division Bench on 27.02.2018 by passing the following order:  
“1. The above Writ Petition has been filed for quashing of the 
chargesheet dated 02.03.2009 (sic.)  filed pursuant to the FIRs 
being numbers RC3(E)/2006/BS&FC/Mumbai dated 20/03/2006 
and RC4(E)/2006/BS&FC/Mumbai dated 21/02/2016 for the 
offences punishable under Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 read 
with 34 of the IPC. The said FIRs have been lodged by the SEBI. 
The gravamen of the allegations is relating to the cornering of the 
shares meant for the retail investors in the IPO of YES Bank. The 
above petition has been filed in January 2018 challenging the 
chargesheets which have been filed on 02/03/2009. The learned 
Counsel for the Petitioner endeavoured to demonstrate to us that 
there is no complicity of the Petitioner in the offences alleged. In 
our view, it is not possible to accept the said contention at this 
stage.  
2. Having regard to the facts as aforestated, we do not deem it 
appropriate to exercise our writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of 
the Constitution of India. The Writ Petition is accordingly 
dismissed. Needless to state that the Trial Court would try the case 
in question on its own merits and in accordance with law.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 

6 
 
10.   Aggrieved by the above order, the first respondent filed a 
Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 3495 of 2018 before this Court. On 
07.01.2020, this Court, while permitting the petitioner to withdraw 
the Special Leave Petition, passed the following order: 
“After some arguments, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior 
Counsel appearing for the petitioner, prays for withdrawal of this 
petition with liberty to raise the question of effect and legal 
consequences of Order dated 07.12.2009 passed by the Securities 
and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), before the High Court.  
Prayer is allowed.  
Accordingly, the special leave petition is dismissed as withdrawn 
with the liberty aforesaid.” 
11.  Thereafter, the first respondent filed Writ Petition No. 245 of 
2020 and Writ Petition No. 730 of 2020 praying for the following 
reliefs:  
“Writ Petition No. 245 of 2020: 
(a) That this Hon’ble Court be pleased to quash and set aside the 
Criminal proceedings i.e. Impugned order dated 10.03.2008 and 
19.03.2008 concerning FIR No. RC 3 1 of 2006, and FIR No. RC 
4 I of 2006 registered with CBI/BS&FC, Mumbai for the alleged 
offences punishable under sections 420, 467, 468 & 471 read with 
120-B of Indian Penal Code. And Sections 13(2) r/w 13(1) (d) of 
the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and section 68 (A) of The 
Companies Act, 1956 filed against the Petitioner, in exercise of the 
extraordinary powers vested with this Hon'ble Court; 

7 
 
(b) Pending hearing, admission and final disposal of this Petition, 
be pleased to stay further proceedings of CBI Spl. Case 47 of 2014 
and CBI Spl. Case 47 of 2014 pending adjudication before the Ld. 
Sessions Court, Mumbai qua the Petitioner, in the interest of 
justice; 
Writ Petition No. 730 of 2020: 
(a) That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to quash and set aside the 
Criminal proceedings i.e. impugned order dated 19.03.2008 
concerning FIR No. RC 3 (E) of 2006, registered with 
CBI/BS&FC, Mumbai for the alleged offences punishable under 
sections 420, 467, 468 & 471 read with 120-B of Indian Penal 
Code and Sections 13(2) r/w 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of 
Corruption Act, 1988 and Section 68(A) of the Companies Act, 
1956 filed against the petitioner, in exercise of the extraordinary 
powers vested with this Hon'ble Court.  
(b) Pending hearing, admission and final disposal of this Petition, 
be pleased to stay further proceedings of CBI Spl. Case 48 of 2014 
pending adjudication before the Ld. Sessions Court, Mumbai, in 
the interest of Justice;” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
12.  In the body of the Writ Petition dealing with the prayers in the 
earlier Writ Petition No. 406 of 2018, the following averment was 
made: 
“9. In pursuance to the said consent order passed by the SEBI, the 
Petitioner being aggrieved by the filing of Charge-sheet dated 
02.03.2009 and 03.04.200 (sic.) and alleged commission of 
offences under Sections 120-B r/w 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the 
IPC and under Sections 13(2) r/w 13(l)(d) of the PC Act, 1988 and 
under Section 68-A of the Companies Act, 1956 filed a Writ 
Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India read with 

8 
 
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 before the 
Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Bombay being Criminal Writ 
Petition No. 406/2018 seeking quashing of the FIR No. RC 3I 
2006/BS&FC and FIR No. RC 4I 2006/BS&FC/Mumbai and the 
resultant Charge sheets dated 02.03.2009 and 03.04.2009.” 
13. It will be noticed that even though the first Writ Petition was 
filed in 2018 after the cognizance orders of 10.03.2008 and 
19.03.2008, the respondent did not make a specific prayer 
challenging the cognizance orders. The respondent merely 
challenged the FIR and the charge-sheet. It is quite inexplicable why 
no challenge was made to the cognizance orders. That matter, 
namely, Writ Petition No. 406 of 2018 was placed before the 
Division Bench in accordance with Part 1 Chapter I of the High Court 
Rules applicable to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay which 
sets out the jurisdiction of Single Judges and Benches of the High 
Court. Rule 2(II)(h), reads as under:- 
“(h) All applications under section 482 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure including applications challenging an Order for issuing 
process in a private complaint, except:-  
i) 
Applications seeking review, modification or setting side of 
any order passed by a Division Bench; 
ii) 
Applications for quashing an F.I.R., C.R., Charge Sheet or 
order directing investigation under section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. 
irrespective of whether such applications have been filed under 

9 
 
section 482 simpliciter or read with Article 226 and/or Article 227 
of the Constitution.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
14.  It will be seen that under the Rules of the High Court, 
applications for quashing of an FIR and Chargesheet are outside the 
jurisdiction of Single Judge and are to be heard by the Division 
Bench. It is by virtue of that Rule that the matter went before the 
Division Bench and with the dismissal of the Writ, the matter 
travelled to this Court and liberty was given to withdraw the Special 
Leave Petition so as to enable the respondent to raise the question of 
the effect and legal consequence of order dated 07.12.2009 passed 
by SEBI. 
15. In the fresh petitions filed, namely, Writ Petition No. 245 of 
2020 and Writ Petition No. 730 of 2020, as is clear from the prayers 
extracted hereinabove, there was no challenge to the FIR and charge-
sheet as was made in the first proceeding. However, there was a 
challenge to the cognizance orders.  
16.  The learned Single Judge quashed the criminal proceedings and 
passed the following operative order: 

10 
 
“39. For all the aforesaid reasons stated herein-above, in my 
studied view, the present are the fit cases in which the Court can 
exercise its inherent power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and 
as also under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. I, therefore, 
conclude that the continuation of the proceedings in Special CBI 
Case No. 47 of 2007 and Special CBI Case No. 48 of 2007 pending 
on the files of the Special Judge (CBI), Greater Mumbai, qua the 
Petitioner herein shall be an abuse of process of Court, therefore, 
the same is hereby ordered to be quashed and set aside in order to 
meet the ends of justice.” 
17. Mr. Alabhaya Dhamija, learned counsel for the CBI contends 
that ordinarily when the matter was permitted to be withdrawn with 
liberty to file a fresh petition afresh, the matter should have been 
placed before the Division Bench. According to the learned counsel, 
the respondent resorted to a clever device by deleting the prayers for 
quashment of FIR and charge-sheet and incorporated fresh prayers 
challenging the cognizance orders of 10.03.2008 and 19.03.2008, 
which two orders were not expressly challenged in the first round. 
According to the learned counsel for the appellant, this was in order 
to have the matter heard by the Single Judge in view of Rule 18(4) 
of Part 1 Chapter I of the High Court Rules. Rule 18(4) reads as 
under:- 
“18(4) The orders and decisions of the Courts constituted under 
the Code of Criminal Procedure, except the application for 

11 
 
quashing an F.I.R., C.R. Charge Sheet or an order directing 
investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. irrespective of 
whether such applications have been filed under Section 482 
simpliciter or read with Article 226 and/or Article 227 of the 
Constitution.” 
On merits, the learned counsel for the appellant submits that mere 
settlement before the SEBI on the adjudication side would not 
absolve a party from the criminal proceedings and that on the facts 
of the present case the allegations are of such a nature which warrant 
the criminal trial to proceed, irrespective of the outcome of the 
adjudication proceedings. 
18. Mr. Siddharth Dave, learned senior counsel for the respondent 
contends that after the petition for special leave was withdrawn, 
prayers were incorporated challenging the cognizance orders and 
there was nothing sinister in deleting the prayer for challenging the 
FIR and charge-sheet. On merits, the learned senior counsel pleaded 
for the dismissal of the Civil Appeals. 
19. We have considered the submissions of the learned counsels 
for the parties and perused the record. The first round of proceedings 
arising out of Writ Petition No. 406 of 2018 was heard and disposed 

12 
 
of by the Division Bench, with the Division Bench rejecting the 
contention of the respondent and dismissing the Writ Petitions. When 
the matter travelled to this Court, the respondent withdrew the 
Special Leave Petition with liberty to file a fresh petition.  
20. We feel that on the facts of this case considering the earlier 
order of the Division Bench and the order of this Court granting 
liberty to file a fresh petition, the present case in the second-round 
ought to have been heard by the Division Bench. We are refraining 
from pronouncing on the aspect whether there was any clever 
manipulation of the prayers to clutch at jurisdiction since anything 
said would prejudice the case of the parties. We say nothing more on 
this at this stage.  
21. The Learned Single Judge, who heard Writ Petition No. 245 of 
2020 and Writ Petition No. 730 of 2020, took the view that in view 
of the consent terms passed by SEBI, it would not be in the interest 
of justice to continue with the criminal proceedings as it would 
tantamount to an abuse of the process of the law. 

13 
 
22.  Considering the course of action we have now adopted, we are 
refraining from commenting on the contentions of the parties with 
regard to the merits of the matter. 
23. As to whether the respondent had made out a case for quashing 
the proceedings will be independently decided by the Division Bench 
which will now hear the matter on remand. The Division Bench will 
not be influenced by the observations of the previous Division Bench 
in Writ Petition 406 of 2018, the order of this Court dated 
07.10.2020, the order of the Single Judge in Writ Petition No. 245 of 
2020 and Writ Petition No. 730 of 2020 and also by the present order 
which we have now passed. The Division Bench will independently 
decide the matter on its own merits and in accordance with law.  
24.    Considering that the FIR was registered in 2006, we request the 
Division Bench to take up the matter and dispose of the two Writ 
Petitions expeditiously and, in any event, not later than three months 
from today.  
25. Since we are remitting the matter, we are inclined to grant an 
interim stay of further proceedings in Special Case No. 47 of 2007 

14 
 
and Special Case No. 48 of 2007 pending before the Special Judge 
(CBI), Greater Mumbai for a period of four weeks from today. 
Parties are at liberty to approach the Division Bench hearing the 
matter for appropriate extension/modification of this interim order 
and the Division Bench shall after hearing the parties make such 
order as it deems fit.  
26.  In view of what we have held above, the impugned order dated 
05.01.2022 in Writ Petition 245 of 2020 and Writ Petition No. 730 
of 2020 is set aside and the matter is remitted to the High Court of 
Judicature at Bombay. On such remand, let the papers be placed 
before the learned Chief Justice of the High Court of Judicature at 
Bombay, for placing the same before an appropriate Division Bench.  
 
The appeals are allowed in the above terms.
