This  appeal  by  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India1,
through its Chairman and the Project Director, PIU, impugns the
judgment  dated  05.04.2016,  whereby  the  writ  petition  filed  by
respondent No. 1, Arvind Kumar Thakur, was allowed with a direction
that the appellant, NHAI, will not levy and collect any fee from
the users at Runni Toll Plaza on Muzaffarpur-Sonbarsa section of
National  Highway-77  with  effect  from  07.07.2015.  It  was  further
directed  that  the  appellant,  NHAI,  shall  not  levy  any  fee  in
exercise of its power under Rule 3(1) of the National Highways Fee
(Determination  of  Rates  and  Collection)  Rules,  20082

completion of the project.
Our attention has been drawn to Rule 3(1) of the 2008 Rules,

and,  thereupon,  the  highway  users  can  be  asked  to  pay  the
prescribed fee by way of toll. The expression “section of national
highway” has not been specifically defined in the National Highways
Act,  19563 or  the  2008  Rules.  However,  in  the  context  of  the
present case, we need not go into the said aspect. The aforesaid
issue is left open.
Our  attention  has  been  drawn  to  the  notification  dated
26.11.2013  issued  under  Section  11  of  the  National  Highways
Authority  of  India  Act,  1988,  in  relation  to  the  stretch  from
kilometre 0.000 to kilometre 89.000 (Muzaffarpur-Sonbarsa Section
of  National  Highway-77).  The  said  notification  states  that  the
section length of 61.70 kilometres for use of two laning with paved
shoulder had been completed. It is also stated that the length of
20.38  kilometres  of  the  bypasses  had  also  been  completed  and,
therefore, the Central Government proposed to levy and collect fee
from the road users. The fee prescribed for 61.70 kilometres is 60%
of the base rate specified in the table given in the notification,
whereas, the fee prescribed for 20.38 kilometres of the bypasses is
at the rate of 90% of the base rate specified in the table given in
the notification.  
After  issuing  the  aforesaid  notification,  an  independent
contractor,  namely,  Intercontinental  Consultants  and  Technocrats
Pvt. Ltd. examined and verified the two laning with paved shoulder
of  the  Muzaffarpur-Sonbarsa  Section  of  National  Highway-77.  It
issued provisional completion certificate dated 29.06.2015.
In the present case, the toll is being collected by NHAI, as
3 “1956 Act”, for short.
2

the  highway  being  constructed  is  under  “Build,  Operate  and
Transfer” basis.  The contractor responsible for laying the highway
is  being  paid  annuity,  which  has  been  fixed  in  terms  of  the
contract.
Having regard to the aforesaid facts, we are of the opinion
that the impugned judgment of the High Court, giving the aforesaid
directions, is unsustainable. The judgment merely refers to Rule
3(1) of the 2008 Rules, but does not interpret or go into the other
aspects and facts which were highlighted and pointed out by the
NHAI. Moreover, in the facts of the present case, this Court, while
issuing  notice,  vide  order  dated  25.04.2016,  had  stayed  the
operation of the impugned judgment subject to the condition that
the amount collected towards toll on the completed portion of the
highway/road shall be deposited in a nationalized bank. The toll
users have, therefore, paid the toll which is now lying with the
nationalized  bank.  The  private  contractor,  who  had  laid  the
highway, has also been paid the annuity. The annuity, it may be
noted, is payable at the rate specified for 15 years. The NHAI
collects  the  toll  till  the  actual  costs  are  recovered  with  a
stipulation  that  after  recovery  of  the  capital  cost  the  fee
leviable would be reduced to 40% of the user fee. 
The toll/fee, having been collected and being available in
the bank, today, it will be impossible to return the same to the
road users. Any order passed by this Court, modifying the interim
order, would in fact, be detrimental and harmful to the road users
as additional amounts would have to be collected to make up for the
cost of the highway.
3

The  amount  lying  deposited  in  the  nationalized  bank  along
with interest may now be utilized by NHAI and would be treated as
toll/fee collected from the users. It will be accounted towards the
actual cost to be recovered. 
Recording  the  aforesaid,  we  set  aside  the  judgment  dated
05.04.2016 and allow the present appeal. Civil Writ Jurisdiction
Case no. 12858/2015 will be treated as dismissed.
Nevertheless,  we  deem  it  appropriate  to  observe  that  the
Union of India and NHAI may examine the question as to whether the
expression  “section  of  national  highway”  requires  proper
elucidation and clarification in a manner permitted by law.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
