FACTUAL ASPECTS 
1. 
These appeals take exception to the judgment and order 
dated 28th October 2020 (for short, ‘the impugned judgment’) 
passed by the National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, New 
Delhi (for short, ‘the NGT’).  There is also a challenge to the 
order dated 24th December 2020, by which, the NGT rejected 
the review petition filed by the appellant for seeking review of 
the impugned judgment.   
2. 
A notification was issued on 14th September 2006 (for 
short, ‘the first EC notification’) by the Ministry of Environment 
and Forests (for short, ‘MoEF’) in exercise of powers under sub-
section (1) and clause (v) of sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the 
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (for short, ‘the EP Act’) read 
with clause (d) of sub-rule (3) of Rule 5 of the Environment

(Protection) Rules, 1986 (for short, ‘the EP Rules’).  Clause 2 of 
the first EC notification is material, which reads thus:   
“2. 
Requirements 
of 
prior 
Environmental Clearance (EC):- The 
following projects or activities shall 
require prior environmental clearance 
from 
the 
concerned 
regulatory 
authority, which shall hereinafter 
referred 
to 
be 
as 
the 
Central 
Government 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Environment and Forests for matters 
falling under Category 'A' in the 
Schedule and at State level the State 
Environment 
Impact 
Assessment 
Authority (SEIAA) for matters falling 
under 
Category 
'B' 
in 
the 
said 
Schedule, before any construction 
work, or preparation of land by the 
project 
management 
except 
for 
securing the land, is started on the 
project or activity: 
(i) All new projects or activities listed in 
the Schedule to this notification;  
ii) Expansion and modernization of 
existing projects or activities listed in 
the Schedule to this notification with 
addition of capacity beyond the limits 
specified for the concerned sector, that 
is, projects or activities which cross 
the threshold limits given in the 
Schedule, 
after 
expansion 
or 
modernization; 
(iii) Any change in product – mix in an 
existing manufacturing unit included 
in Schedule beyond the specified 
range.”  

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 3 of 32 
 
3. 
The notification provided that the projects falling under 
categories A and B set out in the Schedule to the notification 
will require prior Environmental Clearance (EC) from the 
concerned Regulatory Authority.  The Regulatory Authorities 
for different projects have been named in clause (2) of the first 
EC notification.  For the A category, the Central Government in 
the MoEF was named as the Regulatory Authority.  For projects 
in the B category, the State Environment Impact Assessment 
Authority (for short, ‘SEIAA’) was named as the Regulatory 
Authority.  Various procedural aspects regarding applying for 
a grant of EC, its processing, etc., have been incorporated in 
the first EC notification. There were subsequent modifications 
to the first EC notification.  Another notification was issued on 
15th January 2016 (for short, ‘the second EC notification’), by 
which the first EC notification was partly modified.  Clause 7B 
and Appendix-IX were added to the first EC notification, 
providing for an exemption to specific categories of projects 
from the requirement of obtaining EC.  Item 6 in the said 
Appendix-IX reads thus: 
“Appendix-IX 
Exemption of certain cases from 
requirement 
of 
Environmental 
Clearance 
The following cases shall not require 
prior environmental clearance, namely: 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
6. Dredging and de-silting of dams, 
reservoirs, weirs, barrages, river, and 
canals for the purpose of their 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 4 of 32 
 
maintenance, upkeep and disaster 
management. 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..” 
Though the NGT struck down a part of the second EC 
notification, Appendix-IX was not touched. 
4. 
In the Original Application subject matter of these 
appeals, the challenge before the NGT was to the notification 
dated 28th March 2020 (for short, ‘the impugned notification’), 
which modified earlier EC notifications.  Appendix IX to the 
second EC notification provided for exempting certain cases 
from the requirement of obtaining EC.  By the impugned 
notification, Appendix-IX was substituted.  The substituted 
Appendix-IX provided that the prior EC will not be required in 
the thirteen cases set out therein.  We are concerned with items 
6 and 7 of the substituted Appendix-IX, which read thus: 
“Appendix-IX 
Exemption of certain cases from 
requirement 
of 
Environmental 
Clearance: The following cases shall not 
require Prior Environmental Clearance, 
namely:- 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  
6. Extraction or sourcing or borrowing of 
ordinary earth for the linear projects 
such as roads, pipelines, etc. 
7. Dredging and de-silting of dams, 
reservoirs, weirs, barrages, river and 
canals 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
their 
maintenance, 
upkeep 
and 
disaster 
management. 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 5 of 32 
 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..” 
Thus, item 6 in Appendix IX of the second EC notification was 
maintained but was renumbered as item 7. Item 6 was newly 
added. 
5. 
Before we go into the challenge to the impugned 
notification, we must note here that items 6 and 7 were 
substituted by further notification dated 30th August 2023 (for 
short, ‘amended impugned notification’) issued during the 
pendency of these appeals.  Substituted items 6 and 7 in the 
amended impugned notification read thus: 
“6. Extraction or sourcing or borrowing 
of ordinary earth for the linear projects 
such as roads, pipelines, etc. shall be 
subject to the compliance of standard 
operating procedures and environmental 
safeguards issued in this regard from 
time to time. 
7. Dredging and de-silting of dams, 
reservoirs, weirs, barrages, river and 
canals 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
their 
maintenance, 
upkeep 
and 
disaster 
management shall be subject to the 
compliance of environmental safeguards 
issued in this regard from time to time.” 
6. 
The impugned notification was challenged on several 
grounds before the NGT by filing the Original Application 
subject matter of these appeals.  Apart from other grounds, it 
was contended that the impugned notification violated the 
directions issued by this Court in the case of Deepak Kumar 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 6 of 32 
 
& Ors. v. State of Haryana & Ors1.  Even the ground that 
the impugned notification was arbitrary and violative of Article 
14 of the Constitution of India was invoked.  We must note that 
in the Original Application, the specific challenge was only to 
item 6 of the impugned notification. 
7. 
By the impugned judgment, it was held that the 
exemption under item 6 should strike a balance.  The finding 
recorded on this aspect in paragraph 8 of the impugned 
judgment reads thus: 
“8. The second issue is exemption from 
requirement of EC for extraction or 
sourcing or borrowing of ordinary earth 
for the linear projects such as roads, 
pipelines, etc and for dredging and de-
silting 
of 
dams, 
reservoirs, 
weirs, 
barrages, river and canals for the purpose 
of their maintenance, upkeep and disaster 
management. It is possible to take a 
view that the EC can be exempted for 
these 
situations 
on 
account 
of 
assessment 
already 
made 
or 
for 
extraction of earth for linear project 
but such blanket exemption must be 
balanced by sustainable development 
concept. The exemption should strike 
balance and instead of being blanket 
exemption, it needs to be hedged by 
appropriate safeguards such as the 
process of excavation and quantum. 
Similarly, 
in 
respect 
of 
item 
7, 
safeguards 
are 
required 
to 
be 
incorporated in terms of disposal of 
dredged material. These aspects are 
not shown to have been considered and 
the 
reply 
does 
not 
provide 
any 
 
1  (2012) 4 SCC 629 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 7 of 32 
 
explanation thereon. Learned counsel 
for the MoEFCC is also unable to provide 
any justification why these aspects be not 
addressed 
and 
incorporated 
in 
the 
notification 
for 
ensuring 
sustainable 
development concept which is required to 
be enforced by this Tribunal under section 
20 read with section 15 of the NGT Act, 
2010.” 
(emphasis added) 
Accordingly, the Original Application was disposed of by 
directing the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate 
Change (for short, ‘MoEF&CC’) to revisit the impugned 
notification within three months.  An application for review was 
filed, which was dismissed by the second impugned order dated 
24th December 2020. 
8. 
Notice was ordered to be issued on 13th December 2021 
on the appeals.  On 10th August 2023, submissions were heard, 
and the judgment was reserved.  After the judgment was 
reserved, the respondent-Union of India filed an affidavit of Dr 
Sujit Kumar Bajpayee, Joint Secretary, MoEF&CC, dated 12th 
September 2023. Along with the affidavit, two documents were 
also filed on record.  The first document was the Office 
Memorandum dated 21st August 2023 issued by the 
MoEF&CC, 
purportedly 
laying 
down 
the 
enforcement 
mechanism for items 6 and 7 in the impugned notification.  The 
second document brought on record was the amended 
impugned notification.  In view of the issuance of the amended 
impugned notification, even after the verdict was reserved, the 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 8 of 32 
 
parties were permitted to make further submissions on the 
legality and validity of the amended impugned notification.   
SUBMISSIONS 
9. 
The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant 
submitted that the object of the EP Act is to provide for the 
protection and improvement of the environment.  She invited 
our attention to Section 3 of the EP Act, which confers a power 
on the Central Government to take such measures as it deems 
necessary or expedient for protecting and improving the quality 
of the environment and preventing and abating environmental 
pollution.  She pointed out that the first EC notification was 
issued in the exercise of powers conferred under sub-section 
(1) and clause (v) of sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the EP Act.  
Clause (v) empowers the Central Government to take measures 
for restrictions of the areas, in which any industries, operations 
or processes or class of industries, operations or processes 
shall not be carried out or shall be carried out subject to certain 
safeguards.  She also invited our attention to the EP Rules and, 
in particular, Rule 5 thereof.  It lays down that the Central 
Government may consider the factors set out in sub-rule (1) 
while prohibiting or restricting the location of industries and 
carrying out operations and processes in different areas.  She 
pointed out that before issuing the first EC notification, the 
process laid down in sub-rule (3) of Rule 5 was followed.   
10. 
The learned senior counsel invited our attention to a 
decision of this Court in the case of Hanuman Laxman 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 9 of 32 
 
Aroskar v. Union of India2.  She also relied upon a decision 
of this Court in the case of Deepak Kumar1.  She pointed out 
that as a result of item 6, there will not be any regulation of the 
extraction of ordinary earth for utilisation in linear projects, 
such as, roads, pipelines, etc.  She submitted that such a 
blanket exemption will defeat the very object of enacting the EP 
Act and, in particular, Section 3 thereof.  She submitted that 
the decision of this Court in the case of Deepak Kumar1 and 
subsequent decisions mandated that there must be a 
requirement to obtain EC for the minor minerals pertaining to 
materials used for linear projects.  The learned senior counsel 
submitted that allowing the extraction of the earth in such an 
indiscriminate manner is wholly arbitrary and violative of 
Article 14 of the Constitution of India. 
11. 
Inviting our attention to the amended impugned 
notification, the learned senior counsel pointed out that the 
substituted item 6 provides that extraction of ordinary earth 
for linear projects shall be subject to compliance with the 
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and safeguards issued in 
this regard from time to time. Thus, the exemption remains. 
However, an SOP will be laid down to avail the exemption. She 
urged that the substituted item 6 is more arbitrary. 
12. 
The learned senior counsel also pointed out that the 
whole issue was directed to be reconsidered under the 
impugned judgment. But nothing has been placed on record to 
 
2  (2019) 15 SCC 401 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 10 of 32 
 
show that the Central Government made reconsideration in 
true letter and spirit. 
13. 
The learned senior counsel pointed out that the decision 
of this Court in the case of Deepak Kumar1 still holds the field, 
which directs that the leases of minor minerals, including their 
renewal for an area less than 5 hectares, shall be granted by 
the States/Union territories only after getting EC.  She 
submitted that the impugned notification and the amended 
impugned notification, insofar as item 6 is concerned, are 
completely contrary to the directions issued by this Court in 
Deepak Kumar1.  She also urged that before publishing the 
draft of the impugned notification, objections to the draft 
notification were not invited.  She submits that this action 
contravenes the provisions of sub-rule (3) of Rule 5 of the EP 
Rules. 
14. 
The learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on 
behalf of the respondent – Union of India, submitted that in 
view of the insertion of Section 8B in the Mines and Minerals 
(Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (for short, ‘the MMDR 
Act’), the amendment to the first EC notification was required 
to be made.  Our attention was invited to Section 8B, 
incorporated on 13th March 2020 and amended Section 8B, 
effective from 28th March 2021.  She submits that the 
provisions of the first EC notification must conform with the 
amended provisions of the MMDR Act, and therefore, the 
amendments were necessitated.  She also pointed out that in 
terms of the impugned order, the matter was placed before the 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 11 of 32 
 
Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), non-coal mining and EAC, 
MoEF&CC and others in a meeting.  Thereafter, the issue was 
deliberated in the meeting convened on 30th June 2022 under 
the chairmanship of the Joint Secretary of the concerned 
department.  She invited our attention to the minutes of the 
said meeting held on 30th June 2022.  She submitted that the 
ultimate endeavour is to uphold the principles of sustainable 
development. 
 
Relying 
upon 
the 
amended 
impugned 
notification, she submitted that now the exemption granted by 
items 6 and 7 cannot be said to be arbitrary, and it will be 
subject to compliance with the SOP issued on this behalf from 
time to time.  Therefore, safeguards have been introduced, and 
the exemption is not blanket.  She also pointed out that the 
Office Memorandum dated 21st August 2023 takes care of the 
safeguards.  It was also submitted that the grant of exemption 
from the first EC notification is a matter of policy for the Central 
Government and no interference be called for with policy 
matters. 
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS 
15. 
We have carefully considered the submissions.  The EP 
Act was brought into force on 19th November 1986.  The 
statement of objects and reasons of the EP Act specifically 
refers to the substantive decline in environmental quality due 
to increasing pollution, loss of vegetal cover, etc.  It also notes 
the growing risk of environmental accidents and threats to life 
support systems.  It refers to the decisions taken at the United 
Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 12 of 32 
 
Stockholm in June 1972.  In the said Conference, the world 
communities 
resolved 
to 
protect 
and 
enhance 
the 
environmental quality.  Clause (3) of the statement of objects 
and reasons reads thus: 
“(3) In view of what has been stated 
above, there is urgent need for the 
enactment of a general legislation 
on environmental protection which 
inter 
alia, 
should 
enable 
co-
ordination 
of 
activities 
of 
the 
various 
regulatory 
agencies, 
creation 
of 
an 
authority 
or 
authorities with advocate powers 
for 
environmental 
protection, 
regulation 
of 
discharge 
of 
environmental 
pollutants 
and 
handling of hazardous substances, 
speedy response in the event of 
accidents 
threatening 
environment 
and deterrent punishment to those 
who endanger human environment, 
safety and health.” 
(emphasis added) 
 
Even from the preamble of the EP Act, it is apparent that the 
object is to provide protection to the environment and to 
improve the environment.  Section 3 of the EP Act confers 
power on the Central Government to take measures to protect 
and improve the environment.  Sub-sections (1) and (2) of 
Section 3 read thus:  
“3. Power of Central Government to 
take 
measures 
to 
protect 
and 
improve environment.-  
(1) Subject to the provisions of this 
Act, the Central Government, shall 
have the power to take all such 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 13 of 32 
 
measures as it deems necessary or 
expedient 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
protecting 
and 
improving 
the 
quality of the environment and 
preventing controlling and abating 
environmental pollution.  
(2) 
In 
particular, 
and 
without 
prejudice to the generality of the 
provisions of sub-section (1), such 
measures may include measures 
with respect to all or any of the 
following matters, namely:--  
(i) co-ordination of actions by the 
State Governments, officers and 
other authorities--   
(a) under this Act, or the rules 
made thereunder, or  
(b) under any other law for the 
time being in force which is 
relatable to the objects of this 
Act;  
(ii) planning and execution of a 
nation-wide programme for the 
prevention, 
control 
and 
abatement 
of 
environmental 
pollution;  
(iii) laying down standards for the 
quality of environment in its 
various aspects;  
(iv) laying down standards for 
emission 
or 
discharge 
of 
environmental 
pollutants 
from 
various 
sources 
whatsoever: 
Provided that different standards 
for emission or discharge may be 
laid down under this clause from 
different sources having regard to 
the quality or composition of the 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 14 of 32 
 
emission 
or 
discharge 
of 
environmental 
pollutants 
from 
such sources;  
(v) restriction of areas in which 
any industries, operations or 
processes or class of industries, 
operations or processes shall 
not be carried out or shall be 
carried out subject to certain 
safeguards;  
(vi) laying down procedures and 
safeguards for the prevention of 
accidents 
which 
may 
cause 
environmental 
pollution 
and 
remedial 
measures 
for 
such 
accidents;  
(vii) laying down procedures and 
safeguards for the handling of 
hazardous substances;  
(viii) 
examination 
of 
such 
manufacturing 
processes, 
materials and substances as are 
likely to cause environmental 
pollution;  
(ix) carrying out and sponsoring 
investigations 
and 
research 
relating 
to 
problems 
of 
environmental pollution;  
(x) inspection of any premises, 
plant, 
equipment, 
machinery, 
manufacturing 
or 
other 
processes, 
materials 
or 
substances and giving, by order, 
of 
such 
directions 
to 
such 
authorities, officers or persons as 
it may consider necessary to take 
steps for the prevention, control 
and abatement of environmental 
pollution;   

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 15 of 32 
 
(xi) establishment or recognition 
of environmental laboratories and 
institutes 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
functions 
entrusted 
to 
such 
environmental laboratories and 
institutes under this Act;  
(xii) collection and dissemination 
of 
information 
in 
respect 
of 
matters relating to environmental 
pollution;  
(xiii) preparation of manuals,

and 
abatement 
of 
environmental 
pollution;  
(xiv) such other matters as the 
Central 
Government 
deems 
necessary or expedient for the 
purpose of securing the effective 
implementation of the provisions 
of this Act.” 
(emphasis added) 
Section 3 of the EP Act must be read with Rule 5 of the EP 
Rules.  Rule 5 has been enacted to give effect to clause (v) of 
sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the EP Act, which empowers the 
Central Government to put restrictions on the areas in which 
industries, operations or processes shall not be carried out or 
shall be carried out subject to certain safeguards.  Rule 5 of the 
EP Rules reads thus: 
“5. Prohibition and Restriction on 
the location of industries and the 
carrying 
on 
processes 
and 
operations in different areas. 
(1) The Central government may take 
into consideration the following factors

SCOPE OF ADJUDICATION 
16. 
As far as the scope of adjudication in these appeals is 
concerned, it is necessary to refer to the Original Application 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 19 of 32 
 
no.190 of 2020 filed by the appellant.  There were three prayers 
made in the said Original Application, which read thus:  
“(a) Pass an Order quashing newly 
inserted Clause 6 of the Impugned 
Notification dated 28.03.2020 as being 
violative of Article 14 and 21 of the 
Constitution of India, ultra vires the 
provisions of the EPA Act, 1986, the 
EIA Notification dated 14.09.2006, 
and 
in 
further 
violation 
of 
the 
Judgment passed by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court in the Deepak Kumar 
case (supra); 
(b) 
Pass 
an 
appropriate 
Order 
quashing the Impugned Notification 
dated 28.03.2020 as being violative of 
the principles of Polluter Pay, Non-
regression, sustainable development 
and Precautionary Principle; 
(c) Pass an appropriate Order directing 
the Respondent not to allow any 
mining of ordinary earth without a 
prior environmental clearance.” 
From the prayers mentioned above in clauses (a) to (c), it is 
apparent that the specific challenge was to item 6.  Regarding 
clause (b), perhaps the only ground of challenge taken in the 
application was that no public interest was involved in 
exercising the power under sub-rule (4) of Rule 5 of the EP 
Rules for dispensing with public notice. 
17. 
After perusal of the impugned judgment, we find that the 
submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the 
appellant before the NGT were not recorded therein.  The order 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 20 of 32 
 
dated 29th June 2021 passed by this Court in the present 
appeals is relevant, which reads thus:  
“X(name 
masked), 
learned 
senior 
counsel appearing for the appellant, 
submits that the learned counsel 
appearing for the appellant before the 
National Green Tribunal argued that 
exemption could not have been granted 
by the Notification of the Ministry of 
Environment, 
Forest 
and 
Climate 
Change which has not been considered 
by the Tribunal. Y(name masked), 
learned counsel who appeared before 
the Tribunal, is directed to file an 
affidavit that he, in fact, raised this 
point before the Tribunal during the 
course of hearing. 
List the matter after two weeks.” 
The advocate filed an affidavit dated 11th December 2021.  In 
paragraph 5(a) of the affidavit, he stated thus:  
“5. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
(a) That the OA No. 190/2020 was listed 
for hearing before the Hon'ble Tribunal 
by way of video conferencing on 
28.10.2020. On that day the Deponent 
appeared before the Hon'ble Tribunal 
and was granted a hearing. During the 
course of the hearing the Deponent 
raised 
his 
submissions 
inter-alia 
including the fact that the Ministry 
of Environment and Forests did not 
have the power to exempt the 
removal of ordinary earth from the 
purview of the EIA Notification and 
that the exemption as granted for the 
removal of ordinary earth was illegal 
and ultra vires the Environment 
Protection 
Act 
as 
well 
as 
the 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 21 of 32 
 
judgment of this Hon'ble Court in 
Deepak Kumar's Judgment. It is 
submitted that the aforesaid point was 
raised, however the Hon'ble Tribunal 
did 
not 
find 
merit 
in 
the 
said 
submission as is evident from the 
judgment dated 28.10.2020.”                 
                     (emphasis added) 
 
Thus, the Advocate-on-Record stated in the affidavit that what 
was argued before the NGT was the challenge to the exemption 
granted for the removal of ordinary earth for linear projects.  
We may note here that item 7 in the substituted Appendix-IX 
brought on record by the impugned notification was already 
there as item 6 in Appendix-IX to the second EC notification 
dated 15th January 2016.  The appellant did not challenge the 
notification dated 15th January 2016.  Even if we set aside or 
strike down item 7 regarding dredging/desilting in the 
impugned notification, it will continue to exist as item 6 in the 
second EC notification. The second EC notification is not under 
challenge. Therefore, we restrict the challenge to item 6 in the 
substituted Appendix-IX to the impugned notification. 
CHALLENGE TO ITEM 6 IN THE IMPUGNED NOTIFICATION     
Failure to follow the procedure prescribed by sub-rule (3) of 
Rule 5 
18. 
We have already quoted Rule 5 of the EP Rules.  There is 
no dispute that the first EC notification, the second EC 
notification and the impugned notification were issued in the 
exercise of powers under sub-rule (1) of Rule 5 of the EP Rules.  
Sub-rule (2) of Rule 5 provides that while passing an order 
prohibiting or restricting the location of industries and carrying 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 22 of 32 
 
on processes and operations, the Central Government shall 
follow the procedure laid down in Rule 5.  Sub-rule (3) of Rule 
5 requires the Central Government to publish a notice of its 
intention to do so in the official Gazette and in such other 
manner as the Central Government deems fit.  Any person 
interested is entitled to file objections against the proposed 
prohibition or restriction.  The Central Government is required 
to consider the objections before issuing the final notification.  
The said procedure was followed before publishing the first EC 
notification. 
19. 
Sub-rule (4) of Rule 5 empowers the Central Government 
to dispense with the requirement of publication of notice under 
sub-rule (3) of Rule 5 when it appears to the Central 
Government that it is in the public interest to do so.  Thus, 
sub-rule (4) of Rule 5 is an exception to sub-rule (3).  The 
exception can be invoked only on the grounds of public 
interest. 
20. 
Now, we turn to the impugned notification dated 28th 
March 2020.  The recitals of the said notification are important, 
which read thus: 
“S.O. 1224(E).—WHEREAS, vide the 
Mineral Laws (Amendment) Act, 2020

(emphasis added) 
By the impugned notification, after sub-paragraph (2) of 
paragraph 11 of the first EC notification, sub-paragraph (3) 
was inserted to give effect to Sections 8A and 8B of the MMDR 
Act.  An entry has been made in the Schedule against Item 1(a) 
in column (5) for inserting a clause dealing with the evacuation 
or removal and transportation of already mined out material.  

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 25 of 32 
 
Appendix IX, which contains the list of projects exempted from 
obtaining EC, was substituted by the impugned notification. 
21. 
We have quoted above the recitals of the impugned 
notification.  The first three recitals refer to the necessity of 
giving effect to Sections 8A and 8B of the MMDR Act.  
Thereafter, the last recital refers to the Ministry receiving 
representations for waiver of the requirement of prior EC for 
borrowing of ordinary earth for roads.  After that, without giving 
any details, it is mentioned that in the public interest, the 
requirement of publication of notice under sub-rule (3) of Rule 
5 was dispensed with.  At this stage, we may refer to the 
relevant ground specifically taken in the Original Application 
filed by the appellant before the NGT.  Ground J was 
specifically taken on this aspect, which reads thus: 
“J. 
Because 
the 
Respondent 
has 
deliberately and ostensibly circumvented 
the requisite procedures before issuing 
the Impugned Notification, including 
evading previous publication, inviting 
public objections under Rule 5(3) of the 
EP 
Rules, 
1986, 
and 
by 
wrongly 
exercising its powers under Rule 5(4) of 
the EP Rules under the garb of "public 
interest" during the Covid-19 national 
lockdown without offering even a shred 
of reasoning for its actions. It is most 
respectfully 
submitted 
that 
the 
amendments 
brought 
forth 
by 
the 
Impugned Notification serve and further 
the interest of private miners and 
contractors, and the actions of ratifying 
such illegal and mala fide acts of 
disregard 
and 
disobedience 
to 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 26 of 32 
 
environmental norms is in fact against 
public interest at large.” 
 
22. 
We have carefully perused the counter affidavit filed by 
the MoEF&CC before the NGT.  The said affidavit does not deal 
with Ground J at all. It does not specify or set out reasons for 
concluding that in the public interest, the requirement of 
publication of prior notice was needed to be dispensed with.  It 
is pertinent to note that before the issue of the second EC 
notification by which Appendix-IX was incorporated, the 
procedure of inviting objections to the draft notification was 
followed, and the objections were considered.  There is no 
reason to dispense with this important requirement before 
publishing the impugned notification. Article 21 guarantees a 
right to live in a pollution-free environment. The citizens have 
a fundamental duty to protect and improve the environment. 
Therefore, the participation of the citizens is very important, 
and it is taken care of by allowing them to raise objections to 
the proposed notification. After all, citizens are major 
stakeholders in environmental matters. Their participation 
cannot be prevented by casually exercising the power under 
sub-rule (4) of Rule 5. 
23. 
In the present appeals, the questions of law (e) and (f) 
have been incorporated regarding the illegal invocation of the 
power under sub-rule (4) of Rule 5 of the EP Rules.  In the 
grounds of the challenge, ground EE has been taken explicitly 
on this aspect. We have perused the counter affidavit filed by 
the MoEF&CC in these appeals.  We find from the counter 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 27 of 32 
 
affidavit that the contention raised regarding the illegal 
invocation of power under sub-rule (4) of Rule 5 has not been 
dealt with.  We are not going into the question of whether it was 
necessary for the Central Government to specify reasons in the 
impugned notification itself why it came to the conclusion that 
in the public interest, the requirement of public notice should 
be dispensed with.  However, the reasons for the said 
conclusion ought to have been set out in the counter affidavit 
filed before the NGT or, at least, in the counter affidavit filed 
before this Court.  The document recording the satisfaction of 
the competent authority about the existence of public interest 
and the nature of the public interest ought to have been 
produced by the Ministry. But, no such document was 
produced.  Only one conclusion can be drawn. The drastic 
decision to invoke sub-rule (4) of Rule 5 was made without any 
application of the mind.  Hence, the decision-making process 
has been vitiated.   
24. 
The impugned notification was issued two days after the 
nationwide lockdown was imposed due to the COVID-19 
pandemic.  At that time, the work of linear projects, such as 
roads, pipelines, etc., had come to a grinding halt.   So, there 
was no tearing hurry to modify the EC notifications.  Apart from 
the fact that no reasons have been assigned in the counter 
affidavit filed by the Central Government for coming to the 
conclusion that in the public interest, the requirement of prior 
publication of notice was required to be dispensed with, we fail 
to understand the undue haste shown by the Central 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 28 of 32 
 
Government in issuing the impugned notification during the 
nationwide lockdown.  Therefore, the inclusion of item 6 of the 
substituted Appendix-IX will have to be held illegal.  We have 
already given reasons for not dealing with the challenge to item 
7 of the impugned notification. 
ARBITRARINESS  
25. 
There is one more important ground for striking down 
item 6.  But for item 6 in Appendix-IX to the impugned 
notification, for extraction, sourcing, or borrowing of ordinary 
earth for linear projects, prior EC would have been required in 
terms of the first EC notification.  The very object of issuing the 
first EC notification incorporating the mandatory requirement 
of obtaining EC for projects was that the damage to the 
environment must be minimised while implementing projects.  
When an exception is sought to be carved out by incorporating 
Appendix-IX to the requirement of obtaining EC in the first EC 
notification, the exception must be specific.  Item 6 grants 
exemption for “extraction or sourcing or borrowing of ordinary 
earth for linear projects, such as roads, pipelines, etc.”  There 
is no specification about the quantum of ordinary earth, which 
can be extracted on the basis of the exemption.  There is no 
specification of the area which can be used to extract ordinary 
earth.  It is also not provided that only that quantity of ordinary 
earth, which is required to implement the linear projects, is 
exempted.  Importantly, “linear projects” have not been defined.  
Without the definition, it is difficult to imagine which projects 
will be termed linear projects.  The term “linear projects” is very 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 29 of 32 
 
vague. The process to be adopted for excavation has not been 
set out.  Thus, item 6 is a case of completely unguided and 
blanket exemption, which is, per se, arbitrary and violative of 
Article 14 of the Constitution of India.  There is no provision for 
setting up an authority which will decide whether a particular 
linear project is covered by item 6.   
26. 
As stated earlier, during the pendency of the appeals, an 
amendment was made to item 6 by the notification dated 30th 
August 2023.  Even the amended impugned notification does 
not elaborate on the concept of linear projects.  The only 
addition to item 6 is that the extraction, sourcing or borrowing 
shall be subject to compliance with SOP and environmental 
safeguards issued in this regard from time to time.  The 
authority to issue the SOP and environmental safeguards has 
not been specified.  No provision has been made to enforce the 
SOP and environmental safeguards.  No restriction is imposed 
on the quantum of ordinary earth, which can be extracted for 
linear projects.  Therefore, even the amended item 6 continues 
to suffer from the same vice of arbitrariness, which Article 14 
of the Constitution of India prohibits.   
27. 
The learned Additional Solicitor General placed reliance 
on the Office Memorandum dated 21st August 2023.  It provides 
that before carrying on activities mentioned in entry 6, the 
project proponents must notify the State Pollution Control 
Board/Pollution Control Committees.  The State Pollution 
Control Boards are required to monitor the compliance status 
of the SOP/environmental safeguards.  As entry 6 is arbitrary, 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 30 of 32 
 
the Office Memorandum is of no consequence.  Hence, on 
account of the violation of Article 14, item 6 in the impugned 
notification, as well as the amended impugned notification, will 
have to be struck down.  As noted earlier, the object of the EP 
Act is to protect and improve the environment.  Apart from the 
illegality committed by non-compliance with sub-rule (3) of 
Rule 5 of the EP Rules, the exemption granted without 
incorporating any safeguards is completely unguided and 
arbitrary.  Grant of such blanket exemption completely defeats 
the very object of the EP Act. 
NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE DIRECTIONS OF THE NGT 
28. 
In paragraph 8 of the impugned order, which we have 
quoted earlier, the NGT observed that the blanket exemption 
needs to be hedged by appropriate safeguards, such as, the 
process of excavation and quantum.  Therefore, in paragraph 
9, a direction was issued to MoEF&CC to revisit the impugned 
notification in the light of the observations made in paragraph 
8.  Within the three months provided by the NGT to do so, no 
steps had been taken to revisit item 6 of the impugned 
notification. 
29. 
The Ministry has filed an additional affidavit dated 18th 
July 2023, and reliance has been placed on the guidelines for 
sand mining.  As far as item 6 is concerned, in the counter 
affidavit, reliance was placed on the Office Memorandum dated 
8th August 2022, purportedly issued in terms of the directions 
issued in paragraph 9 of the impugned judgment.  It records 
that item 6 shall be subject to the SOP attached to the said 

 
 
Civil Appeal nos.1628-29 of 2021      
                   Page 31 of 32 
 
Office Memorandum.  We have perused the said SOP.  We find 
that the SOP creates no regulatory machinery to ensure the 
implementation of the terms of the SOP.  The SOP does not 
refer to item 6 at all; it merely refers to the activities relating to 
the identification to borrow areas to obtain earth or soil 
materials.  It does not refer to extracting ordinary earth for 
linear projects, such as roads, pipelines, etc.  Therefore, the 
said SOP can hardly be said to be in terms of what the NGT 
ordered the Central Government to do in terms of paragraphs 
8 and 9. 
30. 
We are not entertaining a challenge to item 7 of the 
impugned notification. As none of the respondents have 
challenged the impugned notification, they will have to 
implement the directions issued in terms of paragraph 9 of the 
impugned judgment regarding item 7. 
31. 
Thus, notwithstanding the specific directions issued in 
paragraph 8 read with paragraph 9 of the impugned judgment, 
no safeguards have been provided, such as laying down 
processes, the mode and the manner of excavation and 
quantum. 
32. 
Therefore, we have no hesitation in striking down item 6 
of the substituted Appendix-IX forming part of the impugned 
notification dated 28th March 2020 and item 6 of the amended 
impugned notification dated 30th August 2023. Accordingly, we 
quash item 6 in the two notifications above.

The appeals are, accordingly, partly allowed on above 
terms.  There will be no order as to costs.
