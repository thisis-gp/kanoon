1.      Leave granted. 
2. 
The appellant has approached this Court seeking to assail 
the order dated 17th March, 2016 passed by the learned Single 
Judge of the High Court of Jharkhand whereby the contempt 
application preferred by the appellant alleging non-compliance of 
order dated 22nd September, 2008 passed by the learned Single 
Judge of the High Court in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3040 of 2005 
was dismissed. 
3. 
The appellant claims to have paid a higher price than the 
notified price in an e-auction conducted by the respondent, 
towards lifting of consignments of coal. After the coal had been

lifted, the appellant and other similarly placed companies sought 
refund of the price paid by them over and above the notified price. 
4. 
However, the prayer for refund was not acceded to, upon 
which the appellant instituted Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3040 of 2005 
before the Jharkhand High Court claiming refund of excess price 
paid by it over and above the notified price towards e-auction of 
lifting of consignments of coal by the respondent Company. 
5. 
Likewise, numerous other similarly situated aggrieved coal 
consumers filed writ petitions before different High Courts across 
the country.  These writ petitions were transferred to this Court as 
same involved substantial question of general importance. 
However, the writ petition filed by the appellant was not 
transferred and remained pending before the Jharkhand High 
Court. 
6. 
The issue was adjudicated by this Court vide order dated 30th 
October, 2007 in the case of Somal Pipes Pvt. Ltd. v. Coal India Ltd. 
& Ors., (Transfer Petition (Civil) No. 100 of 2006).  The learned 
Solicitor General of India made a statement before this Court on 
behalf of the respondents that the difference of price paid by the 
party from the period running from 12th December, 2005 to 1st 
December, 2006 shall be refunded.  

3 
 
7. 
In view of the above development, the appellant filed an 
Interlocutory Application No. 4 of 2008 in the pending writ petition 
seeking a direction to refund of excess price paid over and above 
the notified price for the period running between January, 2005 
till October, 2007 along with 12% interest per annum. 
8. 
Learned Single Judge allowed I.A. No. 4 of 2008 vide order 
dated 22nd September, 2008 and directed as follows: - 
“We, while accepting the apology tendered by the alleged 
contemnors, direct as under: 
i. The petitioners shall furnish all documents to the 
learned Advocates-on-Record of the respondents, 
showing the actual payments made to any of the 
subsidiaries of the Coal India Ltd. and the difference 
between the amount paid and the amount notified, by 
12th November 2007. 
ii. The documents furnished by the petitioners shall be 
verified by the officers of the concerned coal companies 
within four weeks thereafter. 
iii. In case of any difference, the learned counsel would 
deliberate upon the matter so as to enable them to come 
out with an accepted solution. 
iv. The Bank guarantee furnished by the petitioners 
shall stand discharged. 
In view of the aforementioned directions, personal 
appearance of the alleged contemnors is dispensed with 
till further orders. Post this matter for further orders, if 
any, on 8th January 2008.” 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in the light of the 
above direction of the Apex Court, the petitioner is entitled to 
refund of the excess payment made by the petitioner over and 
above the notified price. 
Considering the above facts and circumstances, in terms of the 
above stated order of the Apex Court, the petitioner shall, furnish 
all requisite documents if not already furnished, to the counsel for 
the respondents, showing actual payments made to any of the 

4 
 
subsidiaries, to enable assessment in proper perspective 
regarding the actual payment of money made, if any, by the 
petitioner over and above the notified price. After making final 
assessment in this regard, the parties shall sit together and decide 
all the issues relating to refund of the excess amount and the 
mode of refund of such amount, between themselves.” 
 
9. 
However, the payment was not made despite the above order.  
Being aggrieved by the non-compliance of the order dated 22nd 
September, 2008, the appellant filed Cont. Case (Civil) No.247 of 
2010 before the High Court, beseeching the Court to initiate 
contempt proceedings against the respondents.  The Cont. Case 
(Civil) No.247 of 2010 was disposed of by the High Court with a 
direction to the respondents to refund the amount collected in 
excess of notified price together with interest within a period of one 
month, vide order dated 29th May, 2010. 
10. Being aggrieved by non-payment of the amount collected in 
excess of the notified price along with interest, the appellant filed 
Cont. Case(Civil) No. 403 of 2011 for the alleged breach of order 
dated 22nd September, 2008 passed in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3040 
of 2005 and order dated 29th May, 2010 passed in Cont. Case(Civil) 
No. 247 of 2010 by the High Court of Jharkhand.  

5 
 
11. The Cont. Case(Civil) No. 403 of 2011 was dismissed by the 
High Court of Jharkhand vide order dated 17th March, 2016, which 
has been assailed in the present appeal. 
12. It is admitted that for the period between 12th December, 
2005 to 1st December, 2006, the excess amount has been refunded 
to the appellant.  However, the issue regarding the interest payable 
on the refund amount survives. 
13. As per the response in the High Court, the respondents 
claimed to have refunded an amount to the tune of Rs. 30,80,022/- 
to the appellant as against the claim of Rs. 65,93,538/- which, as 
per the authorities, includes the interest towards the period from 
1st January, 2005 to 11th December, 2005. 
14. The appellant, however, disputes 
the claim of the 
respondents that the amount has been paid towards full 
compliance of the orders passed by the High Court and this Court.  
It is also asserted by the appellant that refund of excess amount 
for the period between 1st January, 2007 to March, 2008 is still 
pending. 
15. Learned senior counsel representing the appellant drew our 
attention to the order dated 12th December, 2005 passed by this 

6 
 
Court in a matter involving same controversy in the case of 
Ashoka Smokeless Coal Industries(P) Ltd. and Ors. v Union of 
India & Ors.1, to be specific, para 8 wherein following 
observations/directions were passed:- 
"8. It is pointed out that in respect of some entities, coal was being 
supplied at the notified price enhanced by 20% thereof and this 
would be a guide for fixing the percentage of the excess price to be 
paid by the petitioners. It is pointed out that enhancement of the 
notified price only by 20% was in respect of very small consumers 
and in respect of Central and State Agencies and that cannot form 
the basis for supply of coal to the petitioners herein having a coal 
linkage with the coal companies. Taking note of the circumstances 
as a whole we feel that it would be just and proper to direct the 
petitioner companies/firms, having coal linkage, to pay in addition 
to the notified price, 33 1/3% of the enhanced price, each time they 
claim supply of coal to them based on the linkage and by furnishing 
security for the balance 66 2/3% of the enhanced price with an 
undertaking filed in this Court that the said part of the price will 
also be paid within 6 weeks of the decision of this Court in the writ 
petitions in case the writ petitions are decided against the 
petitioners. To protect the interest of the petitioners and to ensure 
that no permanent harm is caused to them we also think it proper 
to record the undertaking given on behalf of Coal India Ltd. and its 
subsidiaries that in case this Court upholds the challenge made by 
the petitioners and allows the writ petitions filed by them, the 
enhanced price of 33 1/3% now to be paid by the petitioners will be 
refunded to the petitioners within 6 weeks of the judgment of this 
Court with interest thereon at 12% per annum from the date of 
payment till the date of return to the petitioner concerned." 
 
16. Learned senior counsel urged that this Court clearly directed 
that the petitioner therein would be entitled to interest @ 12% per 
annum on the refund amount.  However, admittedly, the 
respondents have refunded the excess amount to the appellant 
 
1 (2006) 9 SCC 228 

7 
 
after applying interest @ 3.5% per annum only, i.e., the bank rate, 
which fact is highlighted from the affidavit filed on behalf of the 
respondents in Contempt Case (Civil) No. 403 of 2011.   
17. The averments to this effect made in para nos. 11, 12 and 13 
of the said affidavit are extracted hereinbelow:- 
“11. That thereafter this Contempt application was taken up for 
hearing and the counsel appearing for the opposite parties 
submitted that due to some confusion regarding rate of interest 
the interest could not be paid however the principal amount has 
been refunded. The Hon'ble Court therefore allow the opposite 
parties time to calculate the interest at the bank rate and payment 
be made thereof.  
 
12. That thereafter the opposite parties by their letter dated 
30.04.2012 requested their Banker namely the SBI, Bank More, 
Dhanbad Branch to inform to them the banking rate of interest 
prevailing during the year 2005 so that the order passed by this 
Hon'ble Court in the case of the petitioner could be complied with. 
 
13. That the SBI, Bank More, Dhanbad Branch by their letter 
dated 30.04.2012 informed the opposite party that the banking 
rate of interest has been 3.5 % with effect from 1.03.2003 and 4% 
with effect from 3.05.2011.” 
 
18. Learned senior counsel urged that the appellant is also 
entitled to a direction for payment of interest on the amount as 
well as on the refund due @ 12% per annum as against 3.5% per 
annum paid by the respondents for the period running from 1st 
January, 2005 to 11th December, 2005 based on the above order 
passed by this Court.

19. He also drew our attention to the order dated 29th May, 2010 
passed by the learned Single Judge of Jharkhand High Court in 
Contempt Case (Civil) No. 247 of 2010, which was passed in 
relation to non-compliance of order dated 22nd September, 2008 in 
I.A No. 4 of 2008 in W.P. (C) No. 3040 of 2005, wherein the High 
Court directed as below:- 
“1. This application has been filed by the petitioner for intimation 
of contempt proceedings against the Opposite Parties for wilful 
disobedience and violation of the order dated 22.9.2008 passed 
by this Court in a writ petition being W.P. (C) No. 3040 of 2005. 
2. It appears that the aforementioned petition was filed by the 
petitioner for a direction restraining the respondents-opposite 
parties to charge or realize the price determined during E-auction 
for the linked quantity of coal which was booked prior to E-auction 
on the basis of scheduled price fixed by the respondents, but the 
said booked and valued paid quantity of coal was not lifted. The 
petitioner also prayed for a direction upon the respondents to 
continue supply of linked quantity of coal to the petitioner’s unit 
as per the notified price in terms of the order passed in C.W.J.C. 
No. 2750 of 1997(R) as also the order passed by Supreme Court 
in Civil Appeal No. 6317 of 1998. The writ petition was heard and 
disposed of by learned Single Judge on 22.9.2008 taking into 
consideration the earlier order passed in the writ petition and also 
the direction issued by the Supreme Court.  For better 
appreciation, the relevant portions of the order passed in the writ 
petition, which is the subject matter of this contempt proceeding, 
are reproduced herein below: 
“From the records, it appears that the present writ 
application was filed originally challenging E-auction 
proposed to be conducted by the respondent BCCL in 
respect of linked quantity of coal with a prayer for a 
direction to the respondent to release the price 
determined during E-auction of the linked quantity of coal 
in the light of the orders passed in CWJC No. 2750 of 
1997(R) which was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 
Civil Appeal No. 6317 of 1998. 
Subsequently, on the allegation that the orders were 
not complied with, petition was filed by the petitioner vide 
I.A. No. 4 in Com Pet. (C) No. 138 of 2007 in C.A. No. 5324 

9 
 
of 2006. While hearing all the contempt petitions together 
in Transfer Petition (Civil) No. 100 of 2006, the Apex Court 
had passed an interim order on 30. 10. 2007 in following 
terms: 
Let the amount deposited by the Coal India Ltd. 
be invested on a short term fixed deposit for 60 
days. 
It is stated by the learned Solicitor General that 
Mr. A.P. Singh, General manager (Sales) CCL, 
has not been able to appear in Court today as 
his 
father 
has 
expired. 
His 
personal 
appearance is exempted. 
The learned Solicitor General appearing on 
behalf of the alleged contemnors tenders an 
unqualified apology on their behalf. The 
learned Solicitor General does not press the 
other I.As. He also does not press the other 
contentions raised in the affidavits of the 
respective alleged contemnors. 
It is submitted by the learned Solicitor General 
that the amount paid by the petitioners, in 
excess of the notified price shall be refunded to 
them upon verification of the documents which 
may be submitted in that behalf. 
We, while accepting the apology tendered by the alleged 
contemnors, direct as under: 
(i). The petitioners shall furnish all document to 
the 
learned 
Advocates-on-Record 
of 
the 
respondents, showing the actual payments 
made to any of the subsidiaries of the Coal 
India Ltd. and the difference between the 
amount paid and the amount notified, by 12th 
November 2007. 
(ii). The documents furnished by the petitioners 
shall be verified by the officers of the concerned 
coal companies within four weeks thereafter. 
(iii). In case of any difference, the Learned 
Counsel would deliberate upon the matter so as 
to enable them to come out with an accepted 
solution. 
(iv). The Bank guarantee furnished by the 
petitioners shall stand discharged. 

10 
 
In view of the aforementioned directions, personal 
appearance of the alleged contemnors is dispensed with 
till further orders. 
Post this matter for further orders, if any, on 8th January, 
2008. 
Learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that in 
the light of the above direction of the Apex Court, the 
petitioner is entitled to refund of the excess payments 
made by the petitioner over and above the notified price. 
Considering the above facts and circumstances, in 
terms of the above stated order of the Apex Court, the 
petitioner shall, furnish all requisite documents, if not 
already furnished, to the Counsel for the respondents, 
showing actual payments made to any of the 
subsidiaries, to enable assessment in proper perspective 
regarding the actual payment of money made, if any, by 
the petitioner over and above the notified price. After 
making final assessment in this regard, the parties shall 
sit together and decide all the issues relating to refund of 
the excess amount and the mode of refund of such 
amount, between themselves. 
This writ application along with the I.A. No. 4 of 
2008 are disposed of with the aforesaid observations.” 
3. From the order passed by the Supreme Court it is evidently 
clear that the learned Solicitor General appearing before the 
Supreme Court, admitted that excess amount was realized by the 
respondent-Coal Company and, therefore, the said amount in 
excess of the notified price shall be refunded to them upon 
verification of documents. In the light of the order passed by the 
Apex Court, the learned Single Judge directed the petitioner to 
furnish all documents showing actual payment made to any of the 
subsidiaries so that the amount in excess of notified price could 
be refunded. Instead of refunding the said amount, now the 
respondent-opposite party is taking a different stand that the 
claim for refund of the amount pertaining to the period between 
January, 2005 to April, 2008 is not tenable as the said amount 
i.e., 13.4% was a part of notified price w.e.f. January, 2005. No 
such stand was taken by the respondent-Coal Company before 
the Supreme Court It cannot be disputed that the power of fixing 
and notifying price was with the Ministry of Coal and the said 
power was delegated to Coal India Limited. Hence, any amount 
cannot be added with the notified price by the subsidiaries of Coal 
India Limited inasmuch as those subsidiaries were never vested 
with the power to add any amount in the notified price. It appears 
that the matter before the supreme Court was in relation to the 

11 
 
undertaking given with regard to refund of the amount deposited 
by the Coal Company in excess of the notified price. 
4. Recently a similar question arose with regard to refund of the 
excess amount deposited by the Coal Company in a writ petition 
before the Patna High Court being CWJC No. 6530/2009 and the 
Patna High Court directed refund of the amount collected by the 
Coal Companies in excess of the notified price. 
5. In the light of the order passed by the Supreme Court and the 
direction issued by this Court, the respondents-opposite parties 
are bound to refund the excess amount with interest in excess of 
the notified price collected by the Coal Companies from the 
petitioner for the period in question. The stand taken by the 
respondents in the show cause cannot be accepted. 
6. In the facts and circumstances, although a prima facie case is 
made out for initiation of contempt proceeding against the 
respondents, but instead of proceeding further the respondents 
are directed to refund the amount collected in excess of notified 
price together with interest for the period in question within a 
period of one month from today.” 
 
20. Learned senior counsel pointed out that SLP(Civil) No. 21019 
of 2010 preferred by the respondents against the order dated 29th 
May, 2010, has been rejected by this Court vide order dated 9th 
September, 2010.   
21. He submitted that in this background, there was no option 
for the respondents, but to comply with the orders passed by the 
Jharkhand High Court and this Court.  As these orders have been 
wilfully disobeyed, appropriate directions deserve to be issued to 
the respondents to make the payment to the appellant in terms 
thereof. 

12 
 
22. Learned counsel representing the respondents admitted that 
the Jharkhand High Court has taken a view in favour of the 
appellant Company in the very same litigation. However, his 
submission was that identical claims had been raised by several 
claimants in different High Courts, one of them being filed before 
the High Court of Calcutta in APO No. 10 of 2011 wherein also, the 
order of refund was passed in favour of the claimant Company on 
4th April, 2012.  The said order has been challenged by the 
respondent Company in SLP(Civil) No. 21888 of 2012 wherein this 
Court has granted stay vide order dated 9th August, 2012. 
23. Thus, as per learned counsel representing the respondents, 
learned Single Judge of the Jharkhand High Court was justified in 
rejecting the contempt application vide order dated 17th March, 
2016 and denying the relief claimed by the appellant for refund of 
amount for the third period beginning from 1st January, 2007 till 
March, 2008 and so also the issue of interest as the lis is sub judice 
before this Court with a stay operating in favour of the respondent 
Company in an analogous matter.  On these grounds, he implored 
the Court to reject the appeal filed by the appellant. 
24. We have anxiously considered the submissions advanced at 
Bar and perused the material placed on record. 

13 
 
25. At the outset, we may note that the plea of respondents that 
on account of pendency of SLP(Civil) No. 21888 of 2012 arising 
from an order passed by the Calcutta High Court, the appellant 
should be denied the rightful claim of refund of excess amount is 
misconceived. 
26. Suffice it to say that the claim of the appellant for refund 
pertaining to the third period, i.e. 1st January, 2007 till March, 
2008 stands concluded with the rejection of SLP(Civil) No. 21019 
of 2010 vide order dated 9th September, 2010 passed by this 
Court(supra).  Admittedly, the appellant has not been refunded the 
amount for the period running from 1st January, 2007 till March, 
2008 and, therefore, the learned Single Judge was not justified in 
discharging the respondents in the contempt case without 
ensuring payment of the refund amount with interest to the 
appellant herein. 
27. The recourse taken by the learned Single Judge in the 
impugned order to the pendency of the SLP before this Court, 
arising from an order passed by the Calcutta High Court was 
absolutely unfounded as the issue inter se between the parties 
herein, has already been concluded by this Court. 

14 
 
28. As a matter of fact, on going through the impugned order 
dated 17th March, 2016, we find that the learned Single Judge 
completely ignored the order dated 9th September, 2010 passed by 
this Court in SLP(Civil) No. 21019 of 2010. 
29. Regarding the issue of interest on the refund for the period 
running from 1st January, 2005 to 11th December, 2005, the 
learned Single Judge rejected the claim of the appellant herein 
holding the said demand to be exaggerated.  While drawing such 
inference, the learned Single Judge completely ignored the 
judgment rendered by this Court in Ashoka Smokeless Coal 
Industries(P) Ltd. and Ors.(supra) wherein a pertinent direction 
had been given to make the refund of the excess amount with 
interest @ 12% per annum.  Admittedly, as per the affidavit filed 
by the respondents(referred to  supra), the interest which has been 
applied on the refund amount for the period between 1st January, 
2005 to 11th December, 2005 is at the bank rate i.e. 3.5% per 
annum.  Evidently thus, the respondents have failed to faithfully 
comply with the orders passed by the Jharkhand High Court as 
well as this Court. 
30. As a consequence, it is hereby directed that the appellant 
shall be entitled to interest @ 12% per annum on the refund 

15 
 
amount for the period running from 1st January, 2005 to 11th 
December, 2005.  The interest @ 3.5% per annum, already paid, 
shall be deducted from the differential amount.  The appellant 
shall also be entitled to receive refund of the excess amount paid 
for the period between 1st January, 2007 till March, 2008 with 
interest @ 12% per annum in the same terms as directed by this 
Court vide order dated 9th September, 2010.  The amount as 
directed above shall be paid to the appellant within a period of two 
months from today failing which, the officers concerned shall be 
made personally liable to pay the interest amount to the appellant. 
31. The appeal stands disposed of.  No order as to costs. 
32. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
