“FIR”) under Section(s) 420, 466, 467, 468, 471 and 120B of the 
Indian Penal Code, 1872 (the “IPC”); and (ii) the criminal 
proceedings emanating thereof (the “Impugned Order”). 
Factual Background 
2. 
The facts and proceedings germane for contextual 
understanding of the present lis, are as follows: 
2.1. An underlying dispute ensued between the Nagar Palika, 
Khategaon (the “Original Plaintiff”) and the Respondents 
in relation to an identified property situated at Kasba 
Khategaon, 
Dewas, 
Madhya 
Pradesh 
(the 
“Suit 
Property”). Accordingly, a civil suit bearing number 114A 
of 1988 seeking inter alia possession of the Suit Property 
was preferred by the Original Plaintiff before the 2nd 
Additional District Judge, Dewas (the “Trial Court”) (the 
“Civil Suit”). Subsequently, vide an order dated 
23.01.1991, the Civil Suit came to be dismissed observing 
inter alia that the Original Plaintiff failed to prove its’ title 
qua the Suit Property (the “Underlying Decree”). 
2.2. Thereafter, an appeal i.e., First Appeal No. 102 of 1991 
was preferred by the Original Plaintiff before the High 
Court (the “Appeal”). Vide an order dated 07.04.1998, the 
High Court upheld the Underlying Decree and held that the 
Suit Property was constructed on land originally vested in 
the erstwhile Holkar State which subsequently came to be 
recorded in the revenue records as nazul land belonging to 
the State Government of Madhya Pradesh (the 
“Underlying Order”). Pertinently, the Underlying Order 
was assailed before a Division Bench of the High Court by 

CRL. APPEAL NOS.1565-67 of 2024  
 
Page 3 of 14 
way of Letter Patent Appeal (“LPA”) No. 357 of 2005, 
however vide an order dated 07.09.2005, the aforesaid LPA 
came to be dismissed. 
2.3. The dispute between the parties seemingly attained 
finality, however, pursuant to a complaint received on 
17.02.2015, an investigation was carried out by the 
Tehsildar, Khategaon, whereunder it was revealed that 11 
(eleven) sale transactions had been carried out by private 
persons in respect of the Suit Property i.e., nazul land 
belonging to the State Government of Madhya Pradesh. 
Notably, the investigation also revealed that the aforesaid 
transactions were carried out fraudulently i.e., (i) without 
the requisite documentation and / or on the basis of forged 
and fabricated documentation; (ii) on the basis of an 
erroneous certificate dated 21.06.2010 issued by the 
Original Plaintiff; and (iii) in connivance with certain 
identified government officials. Accordingly, in view of 
the aforesaid, a complaint dated 25.07.2015 came to be 
furnished by the Tehsildar, Khategaon to the investigating 
agencies (the “Complaint”). 
2.4. In furtherance of the Complaint, the FIR came to be 
registered by the investigating agencies against 22 
(twenty-two) persons including inter alia the Respondents. 
Aggrieved by the registration of the FIR, application(s) 
came to be preferred under Section 482 CrPC before the 
High Court seeking the quashing of the FIR (the 
“Quashing Petition”). Vide the Impugned Order, the High 
Court quashed the FIR and the proceeding(s) emanating 
thereof. The operative paragraph(s) of the Impugned Order 
are reproduced as under:  
 

CRL. APPEAL NOS.1565-67 of 2024  
 
Page 4 of 14 
“05. Considering the above submissions 
and the evidence on record in the form of 
the judgments of the trial Court as well as 
the appellate Court that the respondent-
state has been unable to prove its title. The 
suit as well as the appeal have been 
dismissed and in this light filing of 
criminal proceedings as alleged by the 
Counsel for the petitioners is nothing but 
a ploy to subjugate the petitioners. It has 
ben consistently stated by the Counsel for 
the petitioners that the petitioners are in 
possession of the said land for more than 
90 years and Counsel has relied on 
several judgments of the Hon’ble Apex 
Court as well as this Court in the matter 
of Mohammed Ibrahim and others Vs. 
State of Bihar and another [(2009) 8 SCC 
751], Ramesh Dutt and others Vs. State 
Punjab and others [(2009) 15 SCC 429], 
Rajib 
Ranjan 
and 
others 
Vs. 
R 
Vijaykumar [(2005) 1 SCC 513], Mr. 
Stephen V. Gomes and another [2015 (II) 
MPWN 149], Savitri Pandey and another 
v. State of UP and others [AIR 2015 SC 
2501], AK Sharma (Cdr.) vs. State of MP 
2015(3) 
JLJ 
213 
and 
Chandran 
Ratnaswami Vs. KC Palanisamy and 
others [2013 (6) SCC 740] to state that the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court and this Hon’ble 
Court have repeatedly held and quashed 
FIR and criminal proceedings relating to 
a dispute of title of property and other civil 
disputes 
and 
Counsel 
prayed 
for 
quashment of the FIR.

06. 
Besides Counsel also submitted that 
there was no allegation against the 
petitioners regarding their having forged 
any document or their having manipulated 
any documents or cheating. Then under 
the circumstances offences could not be 
made out against the petitioners. Counsel 
has vehemently urged that the action of the 
Tehsildar in lodging the FIR and 
registration of the offences is a gross 
misuse of the power and invoking the 
criminal law and procedure is purely 
contrary to the principles of natural 
justice as well as the provisions of the law 
since civil proceedings established title 
and the State has lost on both these counts. 
07. 
Hence, I find that a judicial process 
should not be an instrument of oppression, 
or, needless harassment. The Apex Court 
has in several cases warned that 
Authorities should be circumspect and 
judicious in exercising discretion and 
should take all relevant facts and 
circumstances into consideration before 
issuing process; otherwise the process 
would become a mere instrument in the 
hands of the private complainant to seek 
vendetta and short circuit a procedure of 
law. Especially, in the present case the 
civil 
matters 
are 
still 
pending 
consideration and placing reliance on 
Suneet Gupta Vs. Anil Triloknath 
Sharma and others 2008 (11) SC 670 I 
find that the FIR needs to be quashed 
primarily on the ground that the dispute is 

CRL. APPEAL NOS.1565-67 of 2024  
 
Page 6 of 14 
purely civil in nature and the complaint 
amounts to an abuse the process of law. 
 
The impugned FIR stands hereby quashed. 
The petitions are, therefore, allowed.” 
 
2.5. Aggrieved by the aforesaid Impugned Order, the present 
appeal came to be preferred by the Appellant.  
2.6. It would also be apposite to mention that during the 
pendency of the present appeal, certain proceeding(s) 
ensued before the Revenue Court i.e., eviction proceedings 
under Section 248 of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue 
Code, 1959 (the “Code”) came to be instituted by the 
Tehsildar, Khategaon against certain Respondents. The 
aforesaid 
proceedings 
were 
decided 
against 
the 
Respondents by (i) the Tehsildar, Khategaon; (ii) the Sub-
Divisional Commissioner; and (iii) the Additional 
Commissioner. Thereafter a revision petition i.e., revision 
no. 3140/2019/Devas/L.R,was preferred  before the Board 
of Revenue, Madhya Pradesh. Accordingly, vide an order 
dated 26.10.2018, the aforesaid proceedings came to be 
decided in favour of the Respondents (the “Revenue 
Board Order”). Subsequently, a rectification order dated 
02.09.2020 came to be passed by the Ld. Sub-Divisional 
Office, Khategaon, Dewas, Madhya Pradesh whereunder 
the Suit Property was directed to be recorded as ‘abadi 
land’ as against ‘nazul government land’ in the relevant 
revenue records (the “SDO Order”) (hereinafter (i) the 
Revenue Board Order; and (ii) the SDO Order shall 
collectively be referred to as the “Revenue Proceedings”).

Contentions 
3. 
Mr. Padmesh Mishra, learned counsel appearing on behalf 
of the Appellant i.e., the State of Madhya Pradesh, urged the 
following:  
3.1. The High Court proceeded on an erroneous premise i.e., 
that the State of Madhya Pradesh was unable to prove its 
title qua the Suit Property in the Civil Suit; and 
consequently, on the aforesaid flawed premise, the High 
Court proceeded to quash the FIR and the proceedings 
emanating thereof by labelling the same as vexatious. 
Whereas, on the contrary, the Underlying Decree passed in 
the Civil Suit categorically recorded that the Suit Property 
vested in the State of Madhya Pradesh. 
3.2. The allegations levelled against the accused persons in the 
FIR, prima facie reveal the commission of a cognizable 
offence - which ought not to have been scuttled by the High 
Court exercising its jurisdiction under 482 of the CrPC in 
view of the seriousness of the allegation(s). 
3.3.  Mr. Puneet Jain, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 
Respondents, brought forth the following contentions: 
3.4. The underlying dispute was of a civil nature which stood 
adjudicated in favour of the Respondents i.e., in this regard, 
reliance was placed upon the Revenue Proceedings to 
contend that the Suit Property was rightly determined to 
form a part of private land which was validly transferred 
inter se the Respondents.  
3.5. The foundation of the FIR contemplated that the Suit 
Property belonged to State of Madhya Pradesh – however 
the aforesaid premise is no longer valid - as according to 
Mr. Jain, the title of the Suit Property has been adjudicated 

CRL. APPEAL NOS.1565-67 of 2024

to vest in the Respondents by the Board of Revenue, 
Madhya Pradesh and the SDO in the Revenue Proceedings. 
 
Analysis and Findings 
4. 
Having heard the learned counsel(s) appearing on behalf 
of the parties; and having perused the materials on record, we 
find ourselves tasked with determining whether the High Court 
ought to have exercised its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC 
to quash the FIR? 
5. 
As a precursor, it would be relevant to refer to the 
principles governing the exercise of jurisdiction of the High 
Court under Section 482 of the CrPC vis-à-vis the quashing of an 
FIR. This Court in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp 
(1) SCC 335 observed as under:  
 
“102. In 
the 
backdrop 
of 
the 
interpretation of the various relevant 
provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV 
and of the principles of law enunciated by 
this Court in a series of decisions relating 
to the exercise of the extraordinary power 
under Article 226 or the inherent powers 
under Section 482 of the Code which we 
have extracted and reproduced above, we 
give the following categories of cases by 
way of illustration wherein such power 
could be exercised either to prevent abuse 
of the process of any court or otherwise to 
secure the ends of justice, though it may 
not be possible to lay down any precise, 

CRL. APPEAL NOS.1565-67 of 2024  
 
Page 9 of 14 
clearly 
defined 
and 
sufficiently 
channelised and inflexible guidelines or 
rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive 
list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such 
power should be exercised. 
(1) Where the allegations made in the first 
information report or the complaint, even 
if they are taken at their face value and 
accepted in their entirety do not prima 
facie constitute any offence or make out a 
case against the accused. 
(2) Where the allegations in the first 
information report and other materials, if 
any, accompanying the FIR do not 
disclose a cognizable offence, justifying 
an investigation by police officers under 
Section 156(1) of the Code except under 
an order of a Magistrate within the 
purview of Section 155(2) of the Code. 
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations 
made in the FIR or complaint and the 
evidence collected in support of the same 
do not disclose the commission of any 
offence and make out a case against the 
accused. 
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do 
not constitute a cognizable offence but 
constitute only a non-cognizable offence, 
no investigation is permitted by a police 
officer without an order of a Magistrate as 
contemplated under Section 155(2) of the 
Code. 
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR 
or complaint are so absurd and inherently 
improbable on the basis of which no 
prudent person can ever reach a just 

CRL. APPEAL NOS.1565-67 of 2024  
 
Page 10 of 14 
conclusion that there is sufficient ground 
for proceeding against the accused. 
(6) Where there is an express legal bar 
engrafted in any of the provisions of the 
Code or the concerned Act (under which a 
criminal proceeding is instituted) to the 
institution 
and 
continuance 
of 
the 
proceedings and/or where there is a 
specific provision in the Code or the 
concerned Act, providing efficacious 
redress for the grievance of the aggrieved 
party. 
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is 
manifestly attended with mala fide and/or 
where the proceeding is maliciously 
instituted with an ulterior motive for 
wreaking vengeance on the accused and 
with a view to spite him due to private and 
personal grudge. 
 
103. We also give a note of caution to the 
effect that the power of quashing a 
criminal proceeding should be exercised 
very sparingly and with circumspection 
and that too in the rarest of rare cases; 
that the court will not be justified in 
embarking upon an enquiry as to the 
reliability or genuineness or otherwise of 
the allegations made in the FIR or the 
complaint and that the extraordinary or 
inherent powers do not confer an 
arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act 
according to its whim or caprice.” 
 

CRL. APPEAL NOS.1565-67 of 2024  
 
Page 11 of 14 
6. 
We have carefully perused the Underlying Order passed by 
the High Court in the Appeal. The Civil Suit was initiated by the 
Original Plaintiff i.e., Nagar Palika, Khategaon, against 2 (two) 
private individuals. Accordingly, vide the Underlying Decree, the 
Trial Court dismissed the Civil Suit, however, categorically 
found that the Suit Property belonged to the State of Madhya 
Pradesh. This finding was upheld by the High Court in the 
Underlying Order.  
7. 
At this juncture it would also be appropriate to deal with 
the reliance placed by Mr. Jain on the Revenue Proceedings to 
contend that title qua the Suit Property now vested with the 
Respondents and accordingly it was submitted that, reopening 
and / or initiating criminal proceedings would result in an abuse 
of process of law. However, we find ourselves unable to accept 
Mr. Jain’s contention qua the title of the Suit Property. It is trite 
law that revenue records are not documents of title; and nor 
would any findings pursuant to revenue proceedings under the 
Code confer any rights, title or interest upon the Respondents in 
relation to the Suit Property. It is a settled legal position that 
questions of title can only be determined by a civil court of 
competent jurisdiction. Thus, the reliance placed on the Revenue 
Proceedings is misplaced and would be of no assistance to the 
Respondents. 

CRL. APPEAL NOS.1565-67 of 2024  
 
Page 12 of 14 
8. 
The sequitur to the aforesaid discussion is that the High 
Court proceeded on an erroneous assumption i.e., that the State 
of Madhya Pradesh failed to prove its title qua the Suit Property.  
9. 
In the aforesaid context, we now must proceed to deal with 
the issue framed by us in Paragraph 4 of this Judgement. The 
facts of the case reveal that the High Court chose to exercise its 
jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC on the assumption that 
the Suit Property did not vest in the State of Madhya Pradesh. 
However, as we have held to the contrary, we consider it 
appropriate to independently consider whether the allegations 
levelled against the Respondents under the FIR would satisfy any 
of the indicative parameters laid down by this Court in Bhajan 
Lal (Supra) warranting interference by the High Court in 
exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC vis-à-
vis the quashing of an FIR.  
10. 
Additionally, we are conscious of the interplay between 
civil disputes and criminal proceedings, in this regard we find it 
appropriate to refer to a decision of this Court in Mohd. Ibrahim 
v. State of Bihar, (2009) 8 SCC 751, wherein this Court observed 
as under:   
 
“8. This Court has time and again drawn 
attention to the growing tendency of the 
complainants attempting to give the cloak 
of a criminal offence to matters which are 
essentially and purely civil in nature, 
obviously either to apply pressure on the 

CRL. APPEAL NOS.1565-67 of 2024  
 
Page 13 of 14 
accused, or out of enmity towards the 
accused, or to subject the accused to 
harassment. Criminal courts should 
ensure that proceedings before it are not 
used for settling scores or to pressurise 
parties to settle civil disputes. U (See G. 
Sagar Suri v. State of U.P. [(2000) 2 SCC 
636 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 513] and Indian Oil 
Corpn. v. NEPC India Ltd. [(2006) 6 SCC 
736 : (2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 188] ) Let us 
examine the matter keeping the said 
principles in mind.” 
 
 
11. 
Having considered the materials on record,  we are of the 
considered opinion that neither does the present case satisfy any 
of the parameters laid down by this Court in Bhajan Lal (Supra) 
warranting the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482 of the 
CrPC vis-à-vis the quashing of an FIR; and nor can the 
allegation(s) levelled against the accused person(s) be classified 
as ‘purely civil in nature’ or merely ‘cloaked as a criminal 
offence’. Undoubtedly, the genesis of the present dispute 
emanates from civil proceedings qua the possession of the Suit 
Property, however, the dispute in its current avatar i.e. as is 
discernible from the allegation levelled against the Respondents 
in the FIR, has certainly undergone a metamorphosis into a 
criminal dispute which ought not to have been scuttled at the 
threshold, and in fact ought to have been considered on its own 
merits, in accordance with law.
