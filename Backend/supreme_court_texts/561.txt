Civil  Appeals  arising  from  Special  Leave  Petitions  (Civil)1
No.22278/2011  and  22813/2011  are  directed  against  the  common
Judgment and Order dated 20.01.2011, passed by the High Court of
Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur2 in D.B. Civil Special Appeals
No.382/2002 and 470/2002 respectively, whereby the writ appeals filed
by the appellant were dismissed. The Civil Appeal emanating from
SLP (C) No.30963/2018 is directed against the Judgment and Order
dated 04.05.2018, passed by the High Court in D.B. Special Appeal
Writ No.714/2018, whereby another appeal filed by the appellant came
to be dismissed.
BRIEF FACTUAL OVERVIEW:
4.
We propose to deal, first, with the challenge to the order dated
20.01.2011. For the sake of convenience, the factual background,
details and status of the parties shall be with reference to the Civil
Appeal emerging from SLP (C) No.22278/2011.
5.
Respondents  No.1  to  54  were  appointed  as  Research
Assistants in the erstwhile University of Udaipur, renamed as Mohan
Lal Sukhadia University and later on, post-bifurcation, named as the
1 hereinafter referred to as the ‘SLP(C)’.
2 hereinafter referred to as the ‘High Court’.

7
Rajasthan Agricultural University, Bikaner 3(appellant) in the University
Grants  Commission4-recommended  Pay-Scale  of  Rs.300-600
prevailing  at  the  time.  On  07.09.1977,  the  University  of  Udaipur
proceeded to designate Research Assistants as Lecturers in terms of a
Notification dated 02.07.1974, where the term “Junior Lecturer” was
substituted by the term “Lecturer”. It was notified that teachers holding
the post of Junior Lecturers or equivalent post are designated as
Lecturers.  Consequently,  Respondents  No.1  to  54  came  to  be
designated  as  Lecturers. They  were  also  designated  as  Assistant
Professors  later  on  and  began  drawing  the  same  pay-scale  as
admissible to other Lecturers/Assistant Professors.
6.
The  Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Human  Resource
Development, Department of Education  vide Communication dated
22.07.1988 decided to implement a Career Advancement Scheme5 to
make the revision of pay-scale of teachers in Universities and Colleges
with effect from 01.01.1986, such that every Lecturer was to be placed
in a senior scale of Rs.3000-5000 if the person had completed eight
years of service after regular appointment.
3 hereinafter referred to as the ‘University’.
4 hereinafter referred to as the ‘UGC’.
5 hereinafter referred to as the ‘CAS’.

8
7.
The  Government  of  Rajasthan6 decided  to  implement  CAS.
Consequent thereto, the Board of Management7 of the appellant in its
Meeting held on 24.11.1988 resolved to give the revised UGC pay-
scales  to  Lecturers  and  Research  Assistants.  The  Board  further
resolved  to  designate  Lecturers/Research  Assistants  as  Assistant
Professors.  However,  it  was  decided  that  persons  appointed  as
Assistant  Professors  directly,  will  rank  senior  to  the
Lecturers/Research Assistants, so designated as Assistant Professors.
The Board Resolution dated 24.11.1988 was again reviewed by the
Board in its Meeting held on 28.01.1989 and the same was confirmed.
Notification dated 04/06.05.1989 was issued by the appellant to the
effect  that  all  duly  selected  Lecturers/Research  Assistants  will  be
designated as Assistant Professors with effect from 01.01.1973.
8.
The appellant  vide Letter dated 22.11.1990 notified Rules for
implementing  the  CAS  for  Assistant  Professors  in  the  University.
However, on request being made to the State Government to grant
approval to the Resolution dated 24.11.1988 of the Board, the State
Government requested the Vice-Chancellor of the appellant that the
Resolution of the Board dated 24.11.1988 be rescinded. However, fact
6 hereinafter referred to as the ‘State Government’.
7 hereinafter referred to as the ‘Board’.

9
remained that in anticipation of the approval, the appellant had already
issued the requisite orders. Thereafter, the Board in its Meeting dated
29.07.1991, resolved that if any Research Assistant or Lecturer had
been  selected  as  Assistant  Professor  by  the  Statutory  Selection
Committee8, then his service period shall be counted from the date
when he was duly selected by the SSC as Assistant Professor.
9.
Later,  the Deputy Secretary (AP),  Government  of Rajasthan,
Agriculture (Gr.2A) Department, Jaipur on 27.03.1991 wrote a Letter
requesting the University to amend the Resolution of the Board dated
24.11.1988.  It  was  requested  that  the  order  by  which  Research
Assistants/Lecturers  were  designated  as  Assistant  Professors  be
rescinded and the benefit of CAS be extended only to those Assistant
Professors, who were directly selected after regular selection by the
SSC and not to those who were designated as Assistant Professors.
The recommendations which were made by the University as well as by
the Board were, thus, not accepted by the State Government. Hence,
the Research Assistants, who were designated as Lecturers and later
re-designated as Assistant Professors were deprived of the benefit of
the CAS. Respondents No. 1 to 54 preferred writ petitions assailing
such action(s) and the learned Single Judge allowed their writ petitions.
8 hereinafter referred to as the ‘SSC’.

10
The learned Single Judge’s judgment(s) were affirmed by the Division
Bench, which is impugned in the instant batch of appeals.
SUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANT(S):
10. The appellant submits that past service(s) as Lecturers/Research
Assistants cannot be given the same weightage for ex-cadre promotion
as services rendered in the capacity of Assistant Professors. The grade
of Lecturers/Research Assistants is a separate grade, though the pay
may be the same and, therefore, the services rendered in that grade
cannot be considered at par with the services of Assistant Professors. It
was urged that as per the CAS, those Lecturers/Assistant Professors
are eligible for grant of senior scale, who have completed 8 years of
service after regular appointment and that period of service has to be
reckoned from the date of regular appointment. It was advanced that,
admittedly, respondents No.1 to 54 were not appointed as Assistant
Professors on a regular basis.
11.  The  appellant  has  submitted  that  merely  by  re-designating
Research  Assistants  as  Lecturers  and  thereafter  as  Assistant
Professors, they could not have been granted the benefit of CAS. This
benefit was available only to Lecturers, who were directly appointed on

11
the  posts  of  Assistant  Professors  under  the  Rajasthan  Universities
Teachers and Officers (Selection for Appointment) Act, 19749 and had
completed  eight  years  of  service.  Further,  it  was  stated  that  the
definition of the word “teacher” as contained in Section 2(ix) of the 1974
Act  cannot  be  said  to  be  applicable  to  Research  Assistants.   and
considering the non-obstante clause contained in Sections 3 and 12 of
the 1974 Act, the relief of CAS could not have been accorded to the
Respondents No.1 to 54 by granting similar pay-scales.
SUBMISSIONS BY THE RESPONDENTS NO.1 TO 54:
12.
Learned  counsel  for  the  Respondents  submitted  that a
“Research Assistant” is also a teacher under the 1974 Act and in the
previous round of litigation, it has already been held that they are
Lecturers under Section 2(j), Udaipur University Act, 1962 and in view
of the clarification issued by the UGC on 27.11.1990, there was not an
iota  of  doubt  that  the  persons  serving  as  Lecturers  or  on  other
equivalent posts, were also entitled to the benefit of CAS.
13.    When  the  Research  Assistants  have  been  re-designated  as
Lecturers and thereafter as Assistant Professors, it was submitted that
they cannot be deprived of the benefit available to Lecturers. Learned
9 hereinafter referred to as the ‘1974 Act’.

12
counsel would canvass that the CAS does not provide that the benefit
is not available to such incumbents, whose posts have been designated
as  Lecturers.  The  decision  was  rightly  taken  by  the  Board  of  the
appellant  to  accord  the  benefit  of  CAS,  which  was  unnecessarily
objected to by the State Government. The submission was that such
decision  has  been  illegally  reviewed  by  the  appellant,  under  the
directions of the State Government.
ANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION:
14.
Having perused the record and heard learned counsel for the
parties, the Court finds that the order dated 20.01.2011 passed by the
Division Bench needs interference. The basic premise for allowing the
claim of the original writ petitioners/instant Respondents No.1 to 54 to
the  benefit  of  CAS is that  when  Research  Assistants  have  been
designated as Lecturers and thereafter as Assistant Professors, they
cannot be deprived of the benefit(s) available to Lecturers.
15.
At this stage, it is worthwhile to refer to the earlier order of this
Court dated 25.04.1985 in Writ Petition No.9555/1984 and analogous
cases, whereby it was clarified that the order passed by the High Court
and summary dismissal of the SLP (C) thereagainst, “had nothing to

13
do with amalgamation of cadres, a common seniority list or a feeder
source for further promotions” and reiterated that “Research Assistants
and Lecturers are separate and distinct cadres.” Further, the Court
went on to state that the only thing common would be that both would
enjoy the same pay-scale as recommended by the  UGC. The Court
also  observed  that  “Research  Assistants  and  Lecturers  will  form
separate cadres” and that “they need not be brought on a common
seniority list only on the ground that both enjoy the same pay scale as
recommended by the University Grants Commission”.
16.    Subsequent to the Research Assistants (designated as teachers
holding  the  post  of  Junior  Lecturers  or  equivalent  post)  being
designated as Lecturers, they were later re-designated as Assistant
Professors, drawing the same pay-scale as admissible to other faculty
members  like  Lecturers/Assistant  professors.   After  this,  the
Government of India notified CAS  vide Letter dated 22.07.1988 to
make the revision of the pay-scales of teachers in universities and
colleges.  Every  Lecturer  was  to  be  placed  in  a  senior  scale  of
Rs.3000-5000 if he had completed 8 years of service after regular
appointment.  In  terms  thereof,  the  Board  in  its  Meeting  held  on
24.11.1988, resolved to give the revised UGC pay-scales to Lecturers

14
and Research Assistants. The Board further resolved to designate
Research Assistants and Lecturers as Assistant Professors. However,
it  was  decided  that  persons  duly/directly  appointed  as  Assistant
Professors would rank senior to the Lecturers/Research Assistants
designated  as  Assistant  Professors.  This  Resolution  was  again
reviewed  by  the  Board  in  its  Meeting  dated  28.01.1989  and  was
confirmed, followed by Notification dated 04/06.05.1989 to the effect
that all duly selected Lecturers/Research Assistants will be designated
as Assistant Professors with effect from 01.01.1973. The Board under
Resolution  No.245  dated  08.08.1990  approved  the  rules  for
implementing CAS for Assistant Professors and, finally, by way of the
Letter dated 22.11.1990, the appellant notified the said rules. At this
stage, when the appellant requested the State Government to grant
approval  to  the  Board’s  Resolution  dated  24.11.1988,  the  Vice-
Chancellor was approached by the State Government to rescind the
said Resolution. Meanwhile, in anticipation of approval by the State
Government, the appellant had already issued the requisite orders.
17.
Thereafter, the Board in its Meeting dated 29.07.1991 resolved
that if any Research Assistant/Lecturer had been selected as Assistant
Professor by the SSC, then his/her service period shall be counted

15
from the date when he was duly selected by the SSC as Assistant
Professor. Once again, under Letter dated 27.05.1992 of the Deputy
Secretary,  Agricultural  Department,  Government  of  Rajasthan
requested  the  University  to  amend  the  Board’s  Resolution  dated
29.07.1991,  stating  that  the  order,  by  which  the  Research
Assistants/Lecturers  were  designated  as  Assistant  Professors,  be
withdrawn and benefit of CAS be extended only to those Assistant
Professors who were directly/regularly selected by the SSC and not to
those  who  were  designated  as  Assistant  Professors.   The
recommendations which were made by the University as well as its
Board  were,  thus,  not  accepted  by  the  State  Government.  This
prompted filing of various Writ Petitions in the High Court assailing
such action(s).
18.
It transpires that earlier also, the matter of these Research
Assistants  was  before  the  High  Court,  where  the  claim  was  that
Research Assistants were employed for the purpose of conducting and
guiding research and must therefore be regarded as teachers for the
purposes of Section 2(j), Udaipur University Act, 1962. The said relief
was  granted  by  the  learned  Single  Bench  of  the  High  Court,
whereupon the State of Rajasthan preferred an intra-Court appeal

16
before the Division Bench, where it did not succeed. The learned
Single Judge allowed the respondents’ writ petitions and held that the
period of service rendered by the respondents as Lecturers/Assistant
Professors after re-designation as such, can also be counted while
counting the period of 8 years for availing the benefit of CAS. The
learned Single Judge also took the view that the respondents shall be
entitled to consequential benefits with the rider that seniority shall not
be given to them over the Assistant Professors appointed directly and
that the respondents would rank junior to the direct appointees. The
Division  Bench  held  that  as  the  post  of  Research  Assistant  was
included in the post of Lecturer, a Research Assistant must be held to
be  entitled  for  the  same  revision  of  pay-scale  which  has  been
extended to a Lecturer of the University, which was so done. Taking
exception  to  the  Division  Bench  agreeing  with  the  learned  Single
Judge, the State of Rajasthan petitioned this Court too, which again
did not bear fruit for the State. 
19.   
From the above discussion, it is clear that the learned Single
Judge erred in making a fine distinction that the order of this Court in
Writ Petition No.9555/1984 and analogous cases dated 25.04.1985

17
was only with regard to the seniority and the existence of a distinct
cadre. Significantly, this order had nothing to do with pay-scales.
20.
We  find  that  such  a  view  is  justified  only  to  the  extent  of
granting the respondents pay-scales/revised pay-scales as per the
UGC recommendations. However, the CAS was distinct to a general
increase  or  revision  in  pay-scales.  The  CAS  was  intended  for  a
specific purpose i.e., to encourage the teaching staff by offering a
higher  pay-scale,  subject  to  various  conditions.  This  distinction
unfortunately has been lost sight of by the learned Single Judge,
which, in our considered opinion, was a vital factor to be considered.
Whenever a Scheme/Policy is brought into force, ceteris paribus, the
Court could not and would not import something which is not present
therein and which may not be proper to be interfered with, especially
when it relates to financial matters where primacy is required to be
granted to the pay-master as to what scale was to be granted to the
category of staff concerned. By its very nature, such exercise would
fall under the realm of policy-formulation. In the present case, the CAS
itself  envisaged  that  it  was  meant  for  persons  who  were  directly
recruited as Assistant Professors. The CAS specifically provided that

18
every Lecturer was to be placed in a senior scale of Rs.3000-5000 if
he/she had completed 8 years of service after regular appointment.
21.
Pausing here for a moment, the very usage of the term/phrase
“regular appointment” has to be given its proper interpretation and
cannot  be  rendered  redundant  or  superfluous.  Here,  there  is  a
distinction  between  re-designation  and  regular  appointment.   Re-
designation cannot be said to be a regular appointment as it is only
that one post/category/cadre which is given equivalence with another
existing post/category/cadre, but the basic distinction would still lie that
the re-designated post/category/cadre would always be considered to
be an equivalent post of Lecturer/Assistant Professor, whereas the
other/mainline cadre would always be considered to comprise only of
direct recruits. We find our understanding to be in conformity with the
order  of  this  Court  dated  25.04.1985  (supra),  where  it  has  been
clarified that the posts of Research Assistants and Lecturers will form
separate cadres.
22.
If  at  all,  in  law,  it  was  the  position  that  both  the  cadre  of
Research Assistants re-designated as Lecturers/Assistant Professors
and the cadre of directly-recruited Lecturers/Assistant Professors was
one  and  the  same,  there  was  no  occasion  for  this  Court  to

19
categorically  direct  for  maintaining  separate  cadre  and  the  only
clarification which would have been required would be as to how the
persons coming from the two separate cadres would be placed in a
common cadre. But there was no requirement of a common cadre as
the cadres were different and distinct. Notably, the CAS itself restricts
the benefits flowing therefrom to persons who had completed eight
years of service “after regular appointment” – this shows the clear-cut
intent as to which of the two cadres were the subject-matter of those
benefits. Thus, there was no ambiguity in the CAS  per se. If the
intention was that the benefits should go across the board to both
cadres, then there was no requirement to restrict it to persons who had
completed eight years of service after regular appointment.
23.
Significantly, it is not in dispute that the re-designated Research
Assistants/Assistant  Professors  (respondents)  were  never  directly
appointed as Lecturers/Assistant Professors. This Court in State of
Maharashtra v Tara Ashwin Patel, (2016) 15 SCC 717 held:
‘9.  We  have,  therefore,  examined  the  present
appeals on first principles. We find from a bare
reading of the two Resolutions dated 25-10-1977
and  27-2-1989  that  for  the  purposes  of  career
advancement  the  appellants  had  upgraded  the
post of Demonstrator/Tutor to the post of Lecturer
and  it  appears  that  the  respondents  were  also
getting wages for the period of upgradation i.e.

20
from  1-7-1975  to  25-10-1977.  However,  for  the
purposes  of  grant  of  senior  scale  and,
subsequently,  for  the  grant  of  selection  grade,
what  was  required  in  terms  of  the  aforesaid
resolutions  was  actual  service  or  regular
appointment  in  the  post  of  Lecturer.  Thus,  the
respondents did not have and they cannot get the
benefit of the deemed status of upgradation from
1-7-1975 to 25-10-1977.  The deemed status was
apparently  for  the  purposes  of  pay  and  other
allowances and cannot be counted towards actual
physical service rendered by the respondents in
the post of Lecturer.’
(emphasis supplied)
24.
Thus,  on  an  overall  circumspection  of  the  facts  and
circumstances, it is clear that upon re-designation of the Research
Assistants as Lecturers/Assistant Professors, they got what was due to
them in the form of the same pay-scale as was applicable to the
directly-recruited Lecturers, but once it came to the CAS, the CAS
specifically  envisaged  that  benefit  thereunder  was  restricted  to
persons completing 8 years of service after regular appointment. Only
by reason that the respondents were receiving the same pay-scale as
the direct recruits, would not entitle them to get benefit of CAS as it
was subject to fulfilment of certain conditions, including completion of
certain years of service  viz. 8 years. Till the time, the CAS as a
scheme had not been interfered with, it was not proper for the learned
Single Judge to interpret the same in a way which would obliterate the

21
distinction between the two separate cadres. We may also add that
had the intention been that everybody comes on the same platform
and  gets  all  subsequent  benefits,  there  was  no  requirement  of
having/maintaining two cadres. Further, there was no need for this
Court to clarify that the re-designatees and direct appointees would
have separate identities, if for all practical purposes, no distinction was
to be made either on facts or in law. However, this Court clarified that
there would be a segregation as the two cadres would remain, which is
indicative  of  a  difference  between  the  two.  Ipso  facto,  benefits
accorded to one would not accrue to the other unless so specified in
the relevant Scheme, as may be framed by the employer i.e., State
Government/University.  
25.
Accordingly, for the reasons aforesaid, these appeals succeed;
the  orders  in  question,  passed  by  the  learned  Single  Judge  and
affirmed by the Division Bench, are set aside. It is held that the writ
petitioners/private respondents are not entitled to benefits under the
CAS,  as  notified  by  the  Government  of  India  vide Letter  dated
22.07.1988.
26.
Needless to state, if the two cadres are given exactly similar
benefits under orders of the Court, then it would amount to doing

22
something indirectly which cannot be done directly. Moreover, this was
substantially  negated  in  the  earlier  round  of  litigation,  referred  to
above.
27.
We  may  however  clarify  that  to  direct  for  any  recovery  of
monies which may have already been disbursed to the Respondents
No.1 to 54 would amount to inequity at this late stage. Hence, the
same shall not be recovered, but all the pay and emoluments for the
purposes of retiral/service conditions and for post-retiral benefits shall
be reckoned notionally without granting any benefit under the CAS.
Assuming that the respondents are otherwise entitled to any benefit
under  any  other  Scheme/Policy,  it  is  directed  that  the  State
Government or the appellant will not deprive the respondents thereof
by virtue of the instant judgment alone.
28.   The Civil Appeals arising from  SLP (C) Nos.22278/2011 and
22813/2011 are disposed of in the above fashion.
29.    Onto the Civil Appeal arising from SLP (C) No.30963/2018,
which traces its genesis to the order dated 04.05.2018, passed by the
Division Bench. This was tagged with SLP (C) No.22813/2011 by
order dated 30.11.2018 of this Court. In this case, respondents No.1 to

23
9, before their regular appointment as Assistant Professors in the
University, served on an ad-hoc basis in other educational institutions
and also in the University. These respondents preferred a writ petition
with a prayer to reckon their services rendered in such ad-hoc capacity
while determining their eligibility for the grant of senior pay-scale under
the CAS. The relief claimed was granted by the learned Single Judge
and affirmed by the Division Bench relying on the judgment in State of
Rajasthan v Milap Chand Jain, (2013) 14 SCC 562. This Court, while
disposing of Milap Chand Jain (supra), relied on its earlier judgment
dated  10.03.2011  in  Civil  Appeal  No.469/2007 entitled  State  of
Rajasthan v Dr Suresh Chand Agrawal, which was dismissed  in
limine,  leaving  the  question  of  law  open.  Review  Petitions  (Civil)
No.2124-2125/2011 filed in Dr Suresh Chand Agrawal (supra) were
also dismissed by this Court on 14.09.2011. In  Milap Chand Jain
(supra), the State of Rajasthan had moved this Court in respect of the
same impugned order therein, against which appeals stood previously
dismissed by this Court.
30.   Notably, the State Government vide its Letter dated 20.09.1994,
had specifically clarified that the period of ad-hoc service rendered by
the respondents/Assistant Professors shall not be counted for giving

24
benefit  of  senior  pay-scale  under  the  CAS.  We  have  already
elaborated supra10 that the CAS is essentially a policy, and as such,
the respondents cannot claim, nor would they have any vested right for
claiming that the clauses therein be interpreted in a particular manner.
Such an interpretative exercise would have to be left, in the domain of
the appellant, subject to the State  Government’s directives unless
patently perverse or arbitrary. The High Court, hence, was not justified
in counting of the  ad-hoc  service rendered by the respondents for
reckoning the period of computation as required for applying the CAS.
31.   However, it is directed that  there shall not be any recoveries
made from the respondents.  The respondents shall be entitled to the
notional benefit of the pay and emoluments for purposes of calculating
their retiral/service conditions and for post-retiral benefits, but without
grant  of  any  benefit  under  the  CAS.  It  is  clarified  that  if  the
respondents are entitled to benefits under CAS after reckoning eight
years of service from the date(s) of their regular appointment or to
benefits under any other Scheme/Policy, the State Government or the
appellant shall not deny such an advantage to them by virtue of this
judgment alone.
10 In our discussion re the Civil Appeals arising from SLP (C) Nos.22278/2011 and 22813/2011.

32.      Accordingly, for reasons aforesaid, the appeal11 succeeds.  The
orders, as passed by the learned Single Judge and affirmed by the
Division Bench, are hereby quashed and set aside.
33.
Parties are left to bear their own costs. Pending applications are
disposed of in light of the appeals being finally adjudicated on merits.
