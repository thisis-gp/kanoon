3. 
The parties were married on 23.07.2013 at Chennai and 
thereafter they agreed to move to the United Kingdom where 
they stayed together happily for a period of 7½ years. After 
they returned, they stayed together in a residential property 
belonging to the respondent/wife’s father. However, upon 
disputes being cropped, they have separated in April, 2021 and 
since then, it is alleged by the appellant/husband that the 
respondent/wife neither joined his company nor responded to 
any communication and/or messages of the appellant/husband.  
 
4. 
The appellant/husband preferred application under Section 
9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 19551 before the Additional 
Principal Family Court at Chennai, seeking restitution of 
conjugal rights being OP No. 2441 of 2021 whereas the 
respondent/wife subsequently preferred OP No. 2866 of 2021 
for grant of decree of divorce under Section 13(1) (ia) of the 
Act, 1955 on the ground that the marriage between the parties 
has not consummated because of the appellant/husband’s 
impotency.

5. 
In the above factual background, the appellant/husband 
moved I.A. Nos. 8 & 9 of 2023 under Section 45 of the Indian 
 Evidence Act read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 19082 for subjecting the appellant/husband to 
undergo potential test and at the same time referring the 
respondent/wife for fertility test and psychological/mental 
health test for both the parties. Vide order dated 27.06.2023, 
the Trial Court allowed the above interim applications on the 
condition that a competent medical board shall be constituted 
by the Dean, Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, 
Chennai to conduct the subject tests for both the parties as 
prayed for in the interim applications and the report of the 
medical board be sent to the Court through the advocate 
Commissioner in a sealed cover.  Both the parties were 
directed not to reveal the result of the tests to any third party 
and maintain complete secrecy.  
 
6. 
The Trial Court’s order dated 27.06.2023 was challenged 
by the respondent/wife before the High Court by way of two 
 
2  ‘CPC’ 

4 
 
separate revisions which have been allowed by the High Court 
under the impugned order.  
 
7. 
In the course of arguments in this Court, learned counsel 
for 
the 
appellant/husband 
submitted 
that 
when 
the 
appellant/husband is willing to undergo potentiality test, there 
is no reason why the High Court should set aside the entire 
order. The learned counsel for the appellant would refer to the 
decision of this Court in the case of “Sharda vs. Dharmpal” 
(2003) 4 SCC 493. Per contra, the learned counsel for the 
respondent/wife would submit that when the respondent/wife 
is not willing to undergo any test be it fertility test or mental 
health check-up, she cannot be compelled to undergo such 
tests.  
 
8. 
While allowing the revision petitions preferred by the 
respondent/wife the High Court has not assigned any cogent 
reason as to why the appellant/husband cannot be sent for 
potentiality test. Instead of dwelling on the contentions of the 
parties qua the merits of the interim applications decided by 
the Trial Court, the High Court focused on the conduct of the 

5 
 
parties which was not at all germane for deciding the issue as 
to the validity of the order passed by the Trial court.  
 
9. 
Considering the fact situation of the present case, we are 
satisfied that when the appellant/husband is willing to undergo 
potentiality test, the High Court should have upheld the order 
of the Trial Court to that extent. Accordingly, we allow the 
present appeals in part maintaining the order passed by the 
Trial Court dated 27.06.2023 insofar as it directs the 
appellant/husband to take the medical test to determine his 
potentiality. Let the test be conducted in the manner indicated 
by the Trial Court within a period of four weeks from today and 
the report be submitted within two weeks thereafter.  
Impugned order passed by the High Court stands modified to 
the above extent only.
