shows that to challenge the impugned order dated 13.11.2009 passed by 
the High Court the file was put up before the Competent Authority, 
Bareilly, for the first time on 13.04.2011.  On this file the Competent 
Authority directed to seek legal opinion from the District Government 
Counsel (Civil)3.  After receiving the legal opinion from DGC (Civil), 
permission was sought from the State Government which was granted and 
received by the petitioner on 16.09.2011.  Thereafter, to explain the delay 
in filing the petition, the only plea taken is that the matter was entrusted 
to the counsel.  However, later it was found that initially the appeal was 
not filed.  It is further evident from the application that the case was not 
properly followed up at any stage.  The explanation given for seeking 
condonation of huge delay of 1,633 days cannot be accepted, when it is 
not disputed that the petitioner-State appeared before the High Court and 
was heard before passing of the impugned order, so it was within their 
knowledge.   
2.1 
 
Another fact which may be noticed is that the petitioner-State 
at page ‘K’ of the Synopsis and List of Dates has referred to Special Leave 
Petition (Civil)….CC….No.21120 of 2013 titled as ‘State of U.P. & others v. 
 
3 Hereinafter referred to as ‘DGC (Civil)’

Vinod Kumar Tripathi & others’ stating therein that in the aforesaid 
petition identical issue was involved and this Court after condoning the 
delay had issued notice and the matter is still pending.  The actual cause 
title of the Special Leave Petition (Civil)….CC….No.21120 of 2013 is ‘State 
of U.P. and others v. Sanjay Kumar and another’. However, from a bare 
perusal of the order dated 13.12.2013 passed in the aforesaid petition 
annexed with this petition as Annexure P-7, it is evident that the aforesaid 
petition was dismissed on account of delay and on merits. Hence the 
statement was wrong and misleading. 
2.2 
 
Further, the petitioner-State in this petition has mentioned in 
its ground that in an identical case involving the same question of law, the 
petitioner-State had preferred S.L.P.(C)…CC…No.21595 of 2013 titled as 
‘State of U.P. & Anr. vs Vinod Kumar Tripathi & Ors. in which this Court 
had issued notice, and the matter is still pending adjudication before this 
Court. However, the same has also been dismissed by this Court vide 
order dated 19.01.2016.  
3. 
 
From the material placed on record, we do not find sufficient 
cause is made out for condonation of huge delay of 1,633 days in filing the 
present petition.

Consequently, the application for condonation of delay is 
dismissed.  The Special Leave Petition is also dismissed.
