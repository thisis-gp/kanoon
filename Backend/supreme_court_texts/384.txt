2.
Arvind Kejriwal in this appeal has challenged the order and judgment passed
by the trial court and the High Court of Delhi, upholding his arrest by the
Directorate of Enforcement1 on 21.03.2024.
3.
A number of legal pleas and issues have been raised, including the scope
and violation of Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.
We have heard learned counsel appearing for both the appellant as well as
DoE  at  some  length,  albeit  hearing  is  yet  to  conclude  and  considered
decision will take time.
4.
In view of the prolongation of proceedings, in the hearing held on 03.05.2024,
we had put the parties to notice, that the Court may examine the question of

grant of interim bail/release. Accordingly, we have heard arguments on the
said aspect.
5.
DoE had registered ECIR No. HIU-II/14/2022 on 22.08.2022 pursuant to
registration of the predicate offences by the Central Bureau of Investigation2
on 17.08.2022 in RC No. 0032022A0053 under Section 120-B read with
Section 447A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 7 of the Prevention
of Corruption Act, 1988. This RC was registered on the complaint dated
20.07.2022 made by the Lieutenant Governor of the Government of NCT of
Delhi and on the directions of the competent authority conveyed by Director,
Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. 
6.
The  investigation  by  the  DoE  resulted  in  filing  of  the  first  prosecution
complaint on 26.11.2022. The Special Court took cognisance on 20.12.2022.
Thereafter, DoE has filed four supplementary prosecution complaints. CBI
has  filed  a  chargesheet,  followed  by  two  supplementary  chargesheets.
However, charges have not been framed.
7.
At this stage, it is not possible for us to either conclude the arguments or
finally pronounce the judgment. However, there is an intervening factor which
has prompted us to consider and pass the present order, namely, 18th Lok
Sabha General Elections, which are in progress. As the appeal is pending
before us, we do not think it would be proper for us to direct the appellant –
Arvind Kejriwal to approach the trial court for interim bail/release. This may
not  be  apt  in  view  of  the  legal  issues  and  contentions  that  are  under
examination and consideration before us.

8.
It  is  no  gain  saying  that  General  Elections  to  Lok  Sabha  is  the  most
significant and an important event this year, as it should be in a national
election year. Between 650-700 million voters out of an electorate of about
970 million will cast their votes to elect the government of this country for the
next five years. General Elections supply the vis viva to a democracy.3 Given
the prodigious importance, we reject the argument raised on behalf of the
prosecution that grant of interim bail/release on this account would be giving
premium of placing the politicians in a benefic position compared to ordinary
citizens of this country. While examining the question of grant of interim
bail/release,  the  courts  always  take  into  consideration  the  peculiarities
associated with the person in question and the surrounding circumstances. In
fact, to ignore the same would be iniquitous and wrong.
9.
We will now refer to some case law on the power to grant interim bail/release,
which power is exercised routinely even by the trial courts. 
10.
In Mukesh Kishanpuria v. State of West Bengal4, this Court has held that
the power to grant regular bail includes the power to grant interim bail,
particularly in view of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.  
11.
Sunil Fulchand Shah v. Union of India and Others5 observes that parole
by  way  of  temporary  release  can  be  granted  by  Government  or  its
functionaries in case of detenus under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange
and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974. Further, the High Courts
and this Court can direct temporary release of a detenu for specified reasons
3 See  Mohinder Singh Gill and Another  v.  Chief Election Commissioner, New Delhi and Others,
(1978) 1 SCC 405.
4 (2010) 15 SCC 154.
5 (2000) 3 SCC 409.
Crl. Appeal a/o SLP (Crl.) No. 5154 of 2024
Page 3 of 8

when the request is unjustifiably rejected by the authorities. However, the
power of temporary release of a detenu suffering preventive detention is
exercised only in extreme and deserving cases.
12.
In Dadu @ Tulsidas v. State of Maharashtra6, notwithstanding Section 32A
of  the  Narcotic  Drugs  and  Psychotropic  Substances  Act,  19857,  which
prohibits  the  appellate  court  from  suspending  sentence  awarded  to  the
convict,  this  restriction,  it  is  observed,   does  not  affect  the  power  and
authority of the court to grant parole or furlough, even where a person has
been convicted and sentenced and his appeal has been dismissed.
13.
Athar Pervez v. State8, a judgment of the Delhi High Court authored by one
of us (Sanjiv Khanna), on the power to grant interim bail in cases registered
under the NDPS Act, in addition to the judgments noted, refers to Siddharam
Satlingappa Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra and Others9, which decision
leans on the Constitutional Bench judgment in Shri Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia
and Others  v.  State of Punjab10, and  Central Inland Water Transport
Corporation Limited and Another v. Brojo Nath Ganguly and Another11,
and observes: 
“20.  The expression “interim” bail is not defined in the
Code. It is an innovation by legal neologism which has
gained acceptance and recognition. The terms, “interim”
bail/“interim” suspension of sentence, have been used
and accepted as part of legal vocabulary and are well
known  expressions.  The  said  terms  are  used  in
contradistinction  and to  distinguish  release  on  regular
bail  during  pendency  of  trial  or  appeal  till  final
adjudication. Applications for “interim” suspension or bail

are primarily moved and prayed for, when the accused or
convict is not entitled to or cannot be granted regular bail
or suspension of sentence, or the application for grant of
regular bail is pending consideration and is yet to be
decided. “Interim” bail entailing temporary release can be
granted under compelling circumstances and grounds,
even when regular bail would not be justified. Intolerable
grief  and  suffering  in  the  given  facts,  may  justify
temporary  release,  even  when  regular  bail  is  not
warranted. Such situations are not difficult to recount,
though making a catalogue would be an unnecessary
exercise.”
14.
Power to grant interim bail is commonly exercised in a number of cases.
Interim  bail  is  granted  in  the  facts  of  each  case.  This  case  is  not  an
exception.
15.
The prosecution has rightly pointed out that the appellant – Arvind Kejriwal
had failed to appear in spite of nine (9) notices/summons, first of which was
issued in October 2023. This is a negative factor, but there are several other
facets which we are required to take into consideration. The appellant –
Arvind Kejriwal is the Chief Minister of Delhi and a leader of one of the
national parties. No doubt, serious accusations have been made, but he has
not been convicted. He does not have any criminal antecedents. He is not a
threat to the society. The investigation in the present case has remained
pending since August 2022. Arvind Kejriwal was arrested, as noted above, on
21.03.2024. More importantly, legality and validity of the arrest itself is under
challenge before this Court and we are yet to finally pronounce on the same.
The fact situation cannot be compared with harvesting of crops or plea to
look after business affairs. In this background, once the matter is subjudice
and the questions relating to legality of arrest are under consideration, a

more holistic and libertarian view is justified, in the background that the 18th
Lok Sabha General Elections are being held.
16.
We will now refer to the judgments relied on behalf of the DoE:
(i)
In  Anukul Chandra Pradhan  v.  Union of India and Others12, this
Court rejected the constitutional challenge to sub-section (5) to Section 62 of
the Representation of the People Act, 1951, observing that the right to vote is
not a constitutional right, and that the right can be curtailed. Interestingly, the
proviso to the said sub-section states that a person subjected to preventive
detention can vote. The prohibition was upheld on several grounds, including,
inter alia, it promotes the object of free and fair elections. Indeed there are
decisions  of  this  Court  that  advert  to  the  importance  of  elections  in
democracy, described as the barometer and lifeline of parliamentary system
and its setup.13
(ii)
In  K.  Ananda  Nambiar  and  Another v.  Chief  Secretary  to  the
Government of Madras and Others14, challenge to the Defence of India
Rules, 1962 in its application to Members of Parliament, was rejected on the
ground that members of the legislature cannot claim freedom from arrest.
Detention does not violate privileges of the Members of Parliament.
(iii)
In  State of Maharashtra  v.  Anand Chintaman Dighe15, this Court
while allowing the appeal, observed that the High Court has misdirected itself
in granting bail to an accused convicted under the Terrorist and Disruptive
12 (1997) 6 SCC 1.
13 See Anoop Baranwal v. Union of India (Election Commission Appointments), (2023) 6 SCC 161,
quoting from S.R. Chaudhuri v. State of Punjab and Others, (2001) 7 SCC 126.
14 AIR 1966 SC 657.
15 (1990) 1 SCC 397.

Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987, by refusing to look into statements and
further material collected by the investigating agency.
17.
We  would  reject  the  argument  that  the  reasoning  recorded  by  us  in
paragraphs 7, 8 and 14, results in grant of privilege or special status to
politicians. As observed in paragraphs 7, 8 and 14, several peculiarities of the
case have weighed with us.  In  Siba Shankar Das @ Pintu  v.  State of
Odisha and Another16, this Court accepting the appeal, deleted the condition
imposed by the High Court stipulating that the appellant shall not be involved
in any political activities, directly or indirectly. Imposition of this condition, the
order holds, would breach fundamental rights. No such condition should be
imposed. A coordinate Bench of this Court in  State of Andhra Pradesh v.
Nara Chandra Babu Naidu17, in an appeal filed by the State, by an interim
order has deleted  the condition restraining the respondent therein from
organising or participating in public rallies and meetings, thereby permitting
him to participate in the political process. This petition seeking special leave
to appeal is still pending.
18.
For the aforesaid reasons, we direct that the appellant – Arvind Kejriwal will
be released on interim bail in connection with  case ECIR No. HIU-II/14/2022
dt. 22.08.2022 till 1st of June 2024, that is, he will surrender on 2nd of June
2024 on the following terms and conditions:
(a)
he shall furnish bail bonds in the sum of Rs.50,000/- with one surety of
the like amount to the satisfaction of the Jail Superintendent;
(b)
he  shall  not  visit  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Minister  and  the  Delhi
Secretariat;

(c)
he shall be bound by the statement made on his behalf that he shall not
sign  official  files  unless  it  is  required  and  necessary  for  obtaining
clearance/ approval of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi;
(d)
he will not make any comment with regard to his role in the present
case; and
(e)
he will not interact with any of the witnesses and/or have access to any
official files connected with the case.
19.
The grant of interim bail will not be treated as an expression of opinion on the
merits of the case or the criminal appeal which is pending consideration
before us.
