their complaint that culminated in a direction in their 
favour for grant of compensation. 
2. 
Succinctly stated, the facts that led to the captioned 
appeal, are as follows: -   
The appellants are the widow and the children of one 
Shri Narender Kumar Kantilal Modi (hereafter referred to 
as ‘the deceased’) who met with an accidental death due 
to electric shock on 14.07.1996.  Prior to his death, the 
deceased submitted a proposal form for Life Insurance 
Policy on 06.07.1996 and issued cheque of Rs. 3388/- 
towards premium on 09.07.1996 through cheque No. 
187009 dated 08.07.1996 of Dhokla Branch of State Bank 
of Saurastra.  At this juncture, it is to be noted that there 
is no dispute regarding the permissibility of effecting 
premium in the said mode.  After the death of the 
deceased the appellants herein claimed benefits based 
on Insurance Policy Diary No. 832471906.  Even after 14 
months since the death of the policy holder, the 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 3 of 35 
 
respondent did not give any benefit and as such the 
appellants were constrained to cause legal notice.   The 
stand of the respondent for repudiating the claim was 
that the proposal submitted by the deceased was not 
accepted and therefore there is no concluded contract 
between the deceased and the respondent.  In fact, the 
respondent had blocked policy No.832471906 and 
issued Acceptance-cum-First Premium Receipt showing 
the policy No. 832471906. 
3. 
In the aforementioned circumstances, aggrieved 
by the repudiation, the appellants herein approached 
the District Forum by filing complaint No. 1044 of 1997 in 
terms of Section 11 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
(for short “the Act”).  As per order dated 19.07.2001, the 
District Forum allowed the complaint and directed the 
respondent to pay total outstanding amount payable to 
the appellants as per terms and conditions of Insurance 
Policy No. 832471906 along with interest at the rate of 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 4 of 35 
 
12% per annum till realization within 30 days from the 
date of receipt of the copy of the order.  Further, it was 
directed to pay Rs. 5000/- to the appellants towards 
compensation for mental agony and harassment as also 
Rs. 2000/- towards costs.  Aggrieved by the order of the 
District Forum, the respondent herein/the opponent 
therein filed an appeal viz. appeal No. 464 of 2002 before 
the State Commission.  The State Commission dismissed 
the appeal as per order dated 25.07.2006 against which 
the respondent herein filed a revision petition before the 
National Commission in terms of the provisions of the 
Section 21 (b) of the Act.  The impugned order was 
passed thereon and it resulted in reversal of the 
concurrent orders of the forums below and dismissal of 
the complaint.

appearing 
for 
the 
respondent. The factum of submission of proposal for 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 5 of 35 
 
Life Insurance Policy on 06.07.1996 by the deceased and 
also issuance of cheque bearing No. 1870092 therewithal 
towards premium are not in dispute.  The allotment of 
policy No. 832471906, rather its blocking in the name of 
the deceased is also not in dispute.  The contention of the 
appellants before the District Forum was that the 
respondent had accepted the first premium amount and 
issued Acceptance-cum-First Premium Receipt on 
09.07.1996 and in view of the nature of the receipt issued 
the respondent could not have repudiated the claim and 
wriggled out of the liability to assume the risk.   
5. 
Per contra, the respondent took the stand that the 
policy prepared was not actually communicated to the 
deceased and it was blocked on 15.07.1996 owing to the 
demise of the proposer Shri Narender Kumar Kantilal 
Modi.  Further, it was contended that in the aforesaid 
circumstances there was no concluded contract between 
the deceased and the respondent.  It is to be noted that 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 6 of 35 
 
even after taking such a stand the respondent offered Rs. 
1 Lakh on ex gratia basis to the appellants.  However, the 
appellants refused to accept the same and claimed the 
amount payable in terms of the terms and conditions in 
Policy No. 832471906.  Obviously, the District Forum 
took note of the rival factual contentions and also the 
further fact of payment of commission in respect of the 
policy to the agent and consequently, the defence raised 
on behalf of the respondent herein to justify that the 
repudiation of the claim was rejected and the complaint 
was allowed. 
6. 
In the appeal before the State Commission, the 
respondent reiterated the contentions unsuccessfully 
taken before the District Forum.  As noticed before, the 
core contention was that on the date of death of “the 
deceased” there was no concluded contract between the 
insurer and the deceased.  The contentions raised did 
not find favour with the State Commission and the State 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 7 of 35 
 
Commission found that the acceptance of the proposal 
was unconditional and in favour of the deceased and 
therefore the contract should relate back to the date from 
which the insurance coverage was granted i.e., w.e.f. 
28.06.1996.  Assigning such a reason, the State 
Commission dismissed the appeal.  It is the order of the 
appeal confirming the order of the District Forum that 
was taken up in revision before the NCDRC by the 
respondent herein, which culminated in the impugned 
order.   
7. 
A perusal of the impugned order would reveal that 
for reversing the concurrent orders and dismissing the 
complaint, the NCDRC assigned the reason that mere 
receipt and retention of the premium until after the death 
of the deceased-applicant or even the mere preparation 
of the policy and its blocking would not amount to 
acceptance of the proposal for insurance policy.   To 
arrive at such conclusions, it relied on the decision of this 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 8 of 35 
 
Court in Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Raja 
Vasireddy Komalavalli Kamba and Ors.1.   It was held 
that the fora below had erred in directing for payment of 
benefits in terms of the subject policy.     
8. 
Various contentions were raised on behalf of the 
parties before us to support their rival contentions.  We 
have already taken note of the factual contentions raised 
on behalf of the parties.  In the light of the contentions the 
question to be considered is whether the NCDRC was 
justified in reversing the concurrent orders of the forums 
below and in dismissing the complaint.  It is to be noted 
that even after dismissing the complaint NCDRC took 
note of the offer made by the respondent to the appellant 
for payment of an amount of Rs. 1 Lakh ex-gratia vide 
paragraph 4 (d) of the memo of the revision petition, and 
issued a specific direction to the respondent to pay a sum 
of Rs. 1 Lakh to the appellant by way of ex-gratia.  Before 
 
1 (1984) 2 SCC 719   

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 9 of 35 
 
adverting to the rival contentions and looking into the 
correctness or otherwise of the reversal of the 
concurrent orders we find it appropriate to dilate this 
aspect of the impugned order.   
9. 
As noted hereinbefore, as per the impugned order 
the NCDRC dismissed the complaint.  Therefore, the 
question is how can an order carrying a specific 
direction for payment, even by way of ex-gratia, be 
issued in a complaint after dismissing the same.  It is to 
be noted that such an order was passed in a revision 
petition filed by the respondent herein.  Jurisdiction of 
the NCDRC under the Act is provided under Section 21 
thereof.  Section 21 (a) has two Sub-clauses and Sub-
clause (i) thereof deals with the original jurisdiction of 
NCDRC to entertain complaints and Sub-clause (ii) 
thereof deals with appeals against orders of the State 
Commission.  Section 21 (b) deals with its revisional 
power.  Section 21 of the Act reads thus: -  

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 10 of 35 
 
“21. Jurisdiction of the National Commission.— 
Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the National 
Commission shall have jurisdiction—  
(a) to entertain—  
(i) complaints where the value of the goods or 
services and compensation, if any, claimed 
exceeds [rupees one crore]; and  
(ii) appeals against the orders of any State 
Commission; and 
 
 
(b) to call for the records and pass appropriate orders 
in any consumer dispute which is pending before or 
has been decided by any State Commission where it 
appears to the National Commission that such State 
Commission has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in 
it by law, or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction so 
vested, or has acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction 
illegally or with material irregularity.” 
 
10. 
 A bare perusal of Sections 21 (a) and 21 (b) would 
reveal that the powers thereunder are different and 
distinct and the powers under Section 21 (b) is very 
limited.  The NCDRC itself, in the decision in 
Kongaraananthram v. Telecom Distt. Engineer, Ma- 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 11 of 35 
 
Habubnagar2, held that its revisional powers under the 
said Section are very limited.  The said Section provides 
power to call for the records from the State Commission 
and to set aside its order issued sans jurisdiction vested 
in it by law or if the State Commission failed to exercise 
a jurisdiction so vested or if the State Commission has 
acted in exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with 
material irregularity.    
11. 
As noticed hereinbefore, a specific direction was 
issued under the impugned order by NCDRC after 
dismissing the complaint which was allowed by the 
District Forum and got confirmance from the State 
Commission.  It is true that what was ordered by NCDRC 
is not for payment of benefits based on the policy 
bearing No.832471906 but only payment of Rs.1 lakh by 
way of ex gratia, as offered in the memorandum of the 
revision petition.  Ex gratia is an act of gratis and has no 
 
2 1990 SCC OnLine NCDRC 24 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 12 of 35 
 
connection with the liability, payable as a legal duty.  
Going by the Oxford Dictionary of Law, 5th Edition, the 
term “ex gratia” is payment not required to be made by 
a legal duty.   
12. 
In the contextual situation, it is relevant to refer to 
the decision of this Court in Sudesh Dogra v. Union of 
India & Ors.3.  This Court held therein that ex gratia is an 
act of gratis and it got no connection with the liability of 
the State under law and the very nature of the relief and 
its dispensation by the State could not be governed by 
directions in the nature of mandamus unless, of course, 
there is an apparent discrimination in the manner of 
grant of such relief.    
13. 
In the context of the directions, it is also to be noted 
that such an offer was made by the Respondent much 
earlier even before the matter reached the District 
Forum, but the appellant had denied to accept such an 
 
3 (2014) 6 SCC 486 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 13 of 35 
 
offer.  The specific direction, in such circumstances 
issued in exercise of the revisional power dissuade us to 
accept the impugned order as one dismissing the 
complaint in toto and in the aforesaid circumstances, the 
impugned order virtually partakes the character of an 
order modifying the order of the District Forum which 
was confirmed by the State Commission.  Be that as it 
may, we will further consider the question whether the 
NCDRC is justified in reversing the concurrent order in 
the complaint filed by the appellants in exercise of its 
revisional jurisdiction.   
14. 
A perusal of the impugned order would reveal, as 
noted earlier, that the reversal of the concurrent order(s) 
of the forums below and the consequential rejection of 
the complaint made by the NCDRC after coming to a 
conclusion of non-existence of a concluded contract was 
by relying on a decision of this Court in Raja Vasireddy 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 14 of 35 
 
Komalavalli Kamba’s case (supra).  It is true that in the 
said decision this Court held thus:- 
“15. Though in certain human relationships silence to 
a proposal might convey acceptance but in the case of 
insurance proposal, silence does not denote consent 
and no binding contract arises until the person to 
whom an offer is made says or does something to 
signify his acceptance. Mere delay in giving an answer 
cannot be construed as an acceptance, as, prima facie, 
acceptance must be communicated to the offerer. The 
general rule is that the contract of insurance will be 
concluded only when the party to whom an offer has 
been 
made 
accepts 
it 
unconditionally 
and 
communicates his acceptance to the person making 
the offer. Whether the final acceptance is that of the 
assured or insurers, however, depends simply on the 
way in which negotiations for an insurance have 
progressed. See in this connection statement of law 
in MacGillivray 
& 
Parkington 
on 
Insurance 
Law, Seventh Edn., p. 94, para 215.” 
 
15. 
The factual position obtained in the case on hand 
tend us to hold that the NCDRC had failed to bestow 
proper consideration of the factual position which 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 15 of 35 
 
consequently led to the mis-application of the decision 
in Raja Vasireddy Komalavalli Kamba’s case (supra).  
In view of the decision in D. Srinivas v. SBI Life 
Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors.4, wherein this Court 
distinguished 
the 
decision 
in 
Raja 
Vasireddy 
Komalavalli Kamba’s case (supra), we are of the view 
that NCDRC had misdirected itself in considering the 
relevant 
question 
involved, 
which 
was 
rightly 
considered by the District Forum.  In the decision in D. 
Srinivas case, this Court held thus:-   
“12. Although we do not have any quarrel with the 
proposition laid therein, it should be noted that 
aforesaid judgments only laid down a flexible formula 
for the Court to see as to whether there was clear 
indication of acceptance of the insurance.  It is to be 
noted that the impugned majority order merely cites 
the aforesaid judgment, without appreciating the 
circumstances which give rise to a very clear 
presumption of acceptance of the policy by the insurer 
in this case at hand.  The insurance contract being a 
 
4 (2018) 3 SCC 653 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 16 of 35 
 
contract of utmost good faith, is a two-way door.  The 
standards of conduct as expected under the utmost 
good faith obligation should be met by either party to 
such contract.”   
       
16. 
Paragraph 11 of the decision in D. Srinivas case 
(supra) would reveal that the afore-quoted recital was 
made thereunder after considering the decision in Raja 
Vasireddy Komalavalli Kamba case (supra).  In short, 
the decision in D. Srinivas case (supra) would obligate 
us to consider whether the circumstances obtained in 
this case give rise to a very clear presumption of 
acceptance of the policy by the insurer instead of merely 
giving imprimatur to the impugned order of NCDRC on 
the ground that it was rendered relying on the decision 
in Raja Vasireddy Komalavalli Kamba’s case.  In this 
context, it is only apposite to note that though the orders 
were passed by the District Forum which was confirmed 
by the State Commission would reveal that the analysis 
and the consequential conclusion arrived at thereunder 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 17 of 35 
 
lie in conformity with the exercise expected to be 
undertaken based on the aforementioned exposition of 
law in D. Srinivas’s case (supra).  We are not oblivious 
of the fact that the decision in D. Srinivas’s case (supra) 
was rendered much later to the order impugned in this 
appeal.  But then, in view of the exposition of law in 
Murthy v. State of Karnataka & Others5 as also in view 
of D. Srinivas’s case (supra), if the analysis and the 
ultimate conclusions of the District Forum is in tune with 
the decision in D. Srinivas’s case, we are bound to 
restore the same.  In Murthy’s case (supra), this Court 
held that normally the decision of the Supreme Court 
enunciating a principle of law is applicable to all cases 
irrespective of the stage of pendency thereof because it 
is assumed that what is enunciated by the Supreme Court 
is, in fact, the law from inception.   
 
5 (2003) 7 SCC 517 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 18 of 35 
 
17. 
The decision in D. Srinivas’s case was followed by 
this  Court again in the decision in Gokal Chand (D) Thr. 
LRs v. Axis Bank Ltd. and Anr.6, after rejecting a defence 
relying on the decision in Raja Vasireddy Komalavalli 
Kamba’s case.     
18. 
Now, we will proceed to consider the question 
whether circumstances obtained in this case carry clear 
presumption of the acceptance of the policy by the 
insurer, as has been obligated under the decision in D. 
Srinivas’s case (supra).   
19. 
Evidently, it is the case of the appellants that the 
first premium was accepted and a duly signed receipt 
therefor, noting policy No.832471906 was issued by the 
respondent on 09.07.1996.  The contents of the same has 
been reproduced in the synopsis of this case at page ‘E’ 
as hereunder.

Your proposal for Assurance as per particulars 
noted in the schedule has been accepted by the 
corporation as proposed at ordinary rates/with 
E.D.B…………………………………………………… 
…………………………………………………………… 
  
We have also received amount noted in the 
schedule being the First Premium on the policy of

The acceptance of this payment places the corporation 
on risk with effect from the date of this Acceptance cum

20. 
The photocopy of the Acceptance-cum-First 
Premium Receipt is produced by the respondent along 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 20 of 35 
 
with its written submission as Annexure B.  In fact, 
Annexure B would reveal the accuracy and correctness 
of what is stated at page ‘E’ of the synopsis of the 
captioned appeal.   A perusal of the same would make it 
clear that the acceptance of the payment would place the 
Corporation to assume the risk with effect from the date 
of the Acceptance-cum-First Premium Receipt.  True that 
in Annexure B, it is stated that it would be subject to the 
realization of the amount in cash and the terms and 
conditions of acceptance printed overleaf.  Though this 
Court called upon the respondent to produce the 
original, the same was not produced and what was 
produced was only a photo copy as Annexure B.  In this 
context, as also in view of the decision in D. Srinivas’s 
case, it is only appropriate to refer to certain recitals 
from the order of the District Forum.  They, in so far as 
relevant, read thus:-

Shri T.S. Nanavati, who gave two legal notices on 
behalf of the complainants, the opponent have shown 
their failings to pay exgratia payment sum insured 
only in full and final settlement of the dues under the 
aforesaid policy. At this juncture, we have to interpret 
the said all words used by the LIC i.e. Ex- gratia or 
basic sum insured only in full and final settlement of 
the dues under the · above policy all the said words 
are proving that the opponent have issued the policy 
and accepted the risk……………......................... 
…………………………….….. We have also noted that 
the opponent has deliberately not examined any 
witness to prove that the decision to accept the 
proposal was taken by the opponent on 15.07.1996 
and the death of the proposer has taken place on 
14.07.1996, the contract could not be said to have been 
concluded and the contract was never in existence. 
We have noted that the contract was already 
concluded prior to the death of the policy holder Shri 
Narendra Kumar Modi, if the opponent were and are 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 26 of 35 
 
in possession of the documentary evidence to prove 
that the decision to accept the proposal was taken by 
the opponent on 15.07.1996, then definitely, the 
opponent would have produced oral or documentary 
evidence to prove the said facts as this is a crucial 
point, but the opponent has not taken . any action to 
produce oral or documentary evidence oat this point 
i.e. only defense of the opponent in the written 
statement which amounts to crush the object of LIC act 
and other prevailing act to give protection and risk 
coverage…………………………………………………
……...………………………The opponent have not 
produced their own record to prove that after the 
receipt of the proposal and cheque of premium of 
Rs3388/- dated 09.07.1996, the decision to accept the 
proposal was not taken on 09.07.1996 or immediately 
within reasonable period 213 days and took only on 
15.07.1996………….” 
 
21. 
 Obviously, the said First Premium Receipt 
contains the number of the policy as 832471906 and the 
next premium date was shown therein as 28.12.1996.  In 
addition to the aforesaid recitals from the order of the 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 27 of 35 
 
District Forum, we are of the view that certain other 
emerging aspects also assume relevance.   
22. 
Though it is stated, as can be seen from the 
extracted portion, that the issue of the receipt is subject 
to the realization of the amount in cash and the terms and 
condition of acceptance printed overleaf, the printing on 
overleaf is conspicuously absent in Annexure B.  So also, 
there is no case for the respondent that the cheque 
issued was dishonored.  
23. 
The factum of receipt of cheque amount cannot be 
disputed by the respondent.  In fact, the statement in the 
counter affidavit of the respondent in this appeal that the 
appellant’s entitlement is only to get refund of the 
amount tendered as initial deposit at the time of 
submitting proposal would reveal the said position. 
Another circumstance is also relevant in the context of 
consideration based on the decision in D. Srinivas’s case 
(supra) viz., the stand of the respondent that mere 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 28 of 35 
 
preparation of the policy document is not acceptance so 
as to create a concluded contract.  The cheque amount 
was received prior to the death of ‘the deceased’ is not 
in dispute.  Paragraph 5 of the order of the District Forum 
would reveal that the Dhokla Branch of the State Bank of 
Saurashtra issued certificate that Cheque No.187009 
favouring the respondent herein for Rs.3388/- drawn by 
‘the deceased’ was paid by him on 12.07.1996.  The 
order of the State Commission in paragraph 3 would 
reveal the consistent stand of the respondent that the 
proposal form was accepted only on 15.07.1996 whereas 
the death of ‘the deceased’ was on the previous day viz., 
on 14.07.1996 and therefore, there was no concluded 
contract.  The documents pertaining to the proposal 
were perused by both the District Forum and the State 
Commission and the said fact is discernible from their 
respective orders.  The various documents were 
referred to in the orders with reference to the page 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 29 of 35 
 
numbers, in which they are available.   In the said 
context, paragraph 6 of the orders of the State 
Commission assumes relevance and the same to the 
extent it is relevant, read thus:- 
“6. Page 125 is the proposal form. Perusal of the same 
suggests that the amount of Rs. 3,388/- is shown as 
deposit amount and the risk date is shown to be 
28.06.1996. Thus, it will be seen that the policy was 
desired to be effective and risk commenced 
retrospectively with effect from 28.06.1996. It is also 
suggested that the said proposal form was filled in on 
09.07.1996. Page 126 reads the same to be suspense 
memorandum with BOC No. 600392 dated 09 .07 .1996 
and the policy of proposal number is shown as F.P. 
Page 130 reads that next premium would become due 
on 28.12.1996…….” 
  
24. 
In the circumstances, referred to in the orders of 
the District Forum and the State Commission as also 
noted hereinbefore, the question is whether a clear 
presumption as to the acceptance of the policy by the 
insurer is available in the case on hand.   In Annexure B 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 30 of 35 
 
receipt of the first premium, it is specifically stated that 
the acceptance of payment would place the Corporation 
on risk with effect from the date of the said Acceptance-
cum-First Premium Receipt, subject to the realization of 
the amount in cash and the terms and conditions of 
acceptance printed overleaf.   What is printed overleaf is 
not on record as the same was not produced, though it 
should be a part of Annexure B. Thus, the entire 
circumstances discussed based on the documents in the 
orders of the District Forum and the State Commission 
hereinbefore in this judgment, in the light of the decision 
in D. Srinivas’s case (supra) constrain us to hold that the 
proposal was accepted.  
25. 
When the aforesaid being the circumstances 
revealed from the conclusions and concurrent findings 
by the District Forum and the State Commission entered 
with reference to the documents perused by them, in 
exercise of revisional power the NCDRC could not have 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 31 of 35 
 
arrived at a finding that the forums below acted in the 
exercise of jurisdiction illegally or that there occurred a 
material irregularity.  In fact, all the circumstances 
discussed above justify the conclusion of acceptance of 
the proposal prior to the death of ‘the deceased’.   
26. 
There is no case for the respondent that Annexure 
B viz., the First Premium Receipt carrying the assurance, 
as mentioned earlier, was not issued.  Annexure B would 
justify drawing of presumption of acceptance of the 
policy and not otherwise.  We have also found that no 
material irregularity or illegality could be found in the 
conclusions drawn with regard to the acceptance of 
proposal by the District Forum which was confirmed by 
the State Commission with reasons.  We are fortified in 
our 
view 
by 
the 
following 
further 
reasons/ 
circumstances.    
The entry 15.07.1996 in Annexure B and the 
contentions that the factum of death was made known on 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 32 of 35 
 
15.07.1996 and the acceptance of policy also on 
15.07.1996 cannot co-exist.  If the amount received on 
account 
of 
encashment 
of 
cheque 
is 
kept 
as 
deposit/suspense and was not accepted by way of 
premium, as has been contended before the State 
Commission and duly recorded in paragraph 3 of its 
order what was the necessity to prepare the First 
Premium Receipt on 15.07.1996.  There is incongruity in 
the contentions and the documents.  Along with the 
written submission on behalf of the respondent herein, 
true copy of the suspense memorandum/First Premium 
Receipt is produced in this proceeding as Annexure B.  A 
perusal of the same with reference to what is extracted 
from paragraph 6 of the order of the State Commission, 
would reveal certain disturbing aspects.  As stated in 
paragraph 6 thereunder Annexure B would reveal that 
the date for next premium would become due on 
28.12.1996.  At the same time a dubious entry ‘NIL’ is also 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 33 of 35 
 
appearing thereon.  Another dubious entry is the writing 
on the right top corner of Annexure B i.e., 15.07.1996.  
The dubiousness on account of that entry is because of 
the specific stand taken by the respondent.  As noted 
earlier, the stand of the respondent is that the policy was 
prepared on 15.07.1996 and that the First Premium 
Receipt was issued earlier.  If it be so why an entry of 
15.07.1996 should be made in Annexure B.  As stated in 
paragraph 6 of the order of the State Commission, the 
next premium date is shown as due as 28.12.1996.  The 
name and address of Narendra Kumar Kantilal Modi and 
the policy number are also specifically entered therein.     
27. 
In 
the 
aforesaid 
circumstances, 
there 
was 
absolutely no reason or justification for NCDRC to upturn 
the concurrent orders and to order for the dismissal of 
the complaint and at the same time issuing a direction 
only to grant Rs.1 lakh as ex gratia merely because such 
an offer was made by the respondent-insurer in the 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 34 of 35 
 
memorandum of the revision petition.   There cannot be 
any doubt with respect to the position that in the absence 
of anything suggesting that the State Commission had 
acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with 
materially irregularity, interference with an order of the 
State Commission confirming the order of the District 
Forum, in exercise of the limited revisional power under 
Section 21 (b) of the Act, by NCDRC, is without rhyme or 
reason and cannot be sustained.   
28. 
Before the year 1956, life insurance business was in 
the hands of private companies which were operating 
mostly in urban areas.  The avowed objects and reasons 
of the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 would reveal 
that the main object and reason is to ensure absolute 
security to the policy-holder in the matter of his life 
insurance protection.  
29. 
In the circumstances, the impugned order is set 
aside and the order of the District Forum in complaint 

 
C.A. No.270 of 2012 
Page 35 of 35 
 
No.1044 of 1997 dated 19.07.2001 which was confirmed 
by the State Commission as per order dated 25.07.2006 
in appeal No.464 of 2002 is restored.  The respondent is 
granted two months’ time to effect payment in terms of 
the order thus restored.   
30. 
The appeal is allowed.
