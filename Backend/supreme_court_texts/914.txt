1. Leave granted. 
2. Both the Appeals arise out of the common impugned Order dated

appeal, order dated 15.4.1999 (Annexure P3) passed in revision 
under the 1973 Rules as well as order dated 14.5.199 (Annexure

quashed.  
 
Further, we direct the respondents to calculate and communicate 
the outstanding amount, requiring the petitioner to deposit the 
amount in question. The respondents shall also communicate the 
formalities, if any, required to be completed by the petitioners 
within one month from today.  On issuance of such letter, the 
petitioner shall deposit the amount claimed and shall complete 
the formalities, if any, within three months thereafter. In case the 
petitioner fails to make payment within the time granted, the order 
of resumption shall be revived.  
 
It is further made clear that the petitioner shall be entitled to get 
the amount deposited by him towards outstanding payments 
adjusted or he may recover the same by any other mode from 
the allottee/landlord.” 
 
3. This Court vide the order dated 21.01.2016 while issuing notices in the 
SLPs had stayed the operation of the impugned judgment and order 
passed by the High Court. 
4. The short facts giving rise to the present appeals are that: - 
(i) 
The appellants sold the Booth site No. 14, Sector 46-C, 
Chandigarh admeasuring 25.09 sq. yds. to the respondents – 
Manjit Kumar Gulati and Ors. (hereinafter referred to as “the 
allottees”) in an open auction on 99 years leasehold basis on 
12.02.1989.  The allotment letter was issued to the allottees on 
payment of 25% of the premium amount of the auctioned site on 
31.05.1989. The balance 75% of the cost of the auctioned site was 

3 
 
to be paid by the allottees in three equal annual installments 
alongwith the interest thereon.  The first installment due was to be 
paid by the allottees on 12.02.1990.  However, they failed to do 
so and, therefore, a show cause notice dated 14.09.1990 was 
issued to them under Rule 12 (3) of the Chandigarh Lease Hold 
of Sites and Building Rules, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the 
“Rules of 1973”).  Thereafter, number of times, opportunities were 
granted to the said allottees for personal hearing, and make 
payment however, they failed to appear before the concerned 
authorities.  As a result thereof, the Assistant Estate Office 
cancelled the lease of the said respondents – allottees vide the 
order dated 20.11.1991. 
(ii) 
The allottees being aggrieved by the same, preferred an appeal 
before the Chief Administrator, Chandigarh, who, vide order dated 
12.10.1992 disposed of the said appeal by directing the 
respondents – allottees to pay the entire amount of premium with 
interest thereon, the amount of penalties etc. within 15 days.  It 
was further directed that if the respondents – allottees complied 
with the said order, the site would stand restored to them, 
otherwise, the order of Estate Officer shall stand operative and the 
lease of the site shall stand cancelled.

(iii) 
The respondents – allottees, i.e., Manjit Kumar Gulati and Ors. 
challenged the order dated 12.10.1992 passed by the Chief 
Administrator, Chandigarh before the Advisor, Chandigarh on 
07.04.1999 by filing a petition being No.26 of 1999, which came 
to be dismissed by the Advisor, Chandigarh vide the order dated 
07.04.1999. 
(iv) 
The alleged tenant – M/s. Mohit Medicos, also filed an appeal 
before the Chief Administrator challenging the order dated 
20.11.1991 passed by the Assistant Estate Office, which came to 
be dismissed on 06.10.1998.   The said tenant also filed a petition 
being No.63 of 1998 before the Advisor, Chandigarh, which came 
to be dismissed vide the order dated 15.04.1999. 
(v) 
The allottees – Manjit Kumar Gulati and Ors. filed writ petition 
being C.W.P. No.6866 of 1999 and the alleged tenant – M/s. Mohit 
Medicos filed separate writ petition being C.W.P. No.8467 of 
1999, challenging the orders passed by the Authorities of the 
appellants, and seeking restoration of the site in question. 
(vi) 
Both the writ petitions having been allowed by the High Court vide 
the common impugned order as stated hereinabove, the 
appellants have preferred the instant Appeals.

5. It may be noted that the respondents – allottees – Manjit Kumar Gulati 
and Ors. have chosen to remain absent before this Court, though duly 
served with the notices, as per the Office Report dated 26.11.2024. 
6. We have heard learned counsel, Mr. Varun Chugh appearing for the 
appellants in Civil Appeals arising out of SLP (C) Nos.2283-2284 of 
2016 and Mr. Neeraj Kumar Jain, learned senior counsel appearing for 
the respondent(s) – alleged tenant – M/s. Mohit Medicos in Civil Appeal 
arising out of SLP (C) No.2284 of 2016. 
7. It is sought to be submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the 
appellants that since the allottees had failed to make payment of the 
remaining 75% of the premium amount as per the terms and conditions 
of the auction sale, the lease of the auction site was cancelled by the 
Assistant Estate Office, after giving sufficient opportunities to the 
allottees to clear the outstanding dues, and the said order was 
confirmed by the Chief Administrator.  The revision petition filed by the 
allottees was also dismissed by the Advisor, Chandigarh on the ground 
of gross delay. Hence, according to him, the High Court, in exercise of 
its jurisdiction under Article 226, should not have interfered with the said 
orders passed by the statutory authorities. 
8. He further submitted that the respondent(s) – M/s. Mohit Medicos 
alleging to be the tenant is the proxy litigant and had no locus standi to 

6 
 
file the writ petition before the High Court, more particularly, when the 
said respondents had failed to produce any document to show any lease 
agreement between the original allottees and the said respondent(s) - 
tenant. 
9. However, the learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent(s) – 
alleged tenant M/s. Mohit Medicos, placing reliance on the decision of 
Punjab and Haryana High Court, rendered by the Full Bench in Brij 
Mohan Vs. Chief Administrator and others1, submitted that the 
expression “transferee” contained in clause (k) of Section 2 of the 
Capital of Punjab (Development and Regulation) Act, 1952 included the 
“lessee”, and therefore the respondent(s) – M/s. Mohit Medicos had the 
locus standi to file the writ petition before the High Court challenging the 
orders passed by the statutory authorities, as well as the order passed 
in the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 
(hereinafter referred to as the “Public Premises Act”).  He fairly 
submitted that the said respondent(s) had not produced on record any 
document to show that that M/s. Mohit Medicos was the tenant of the 
allottees – Manjit Kumar Gulati and Ors.

10. At the outset, it may be noted that undisputedly the original allotment 
made in favour of the allottees – Manjit Kumar Gulati and Ors. was 
cancelled by the Assistant Estate Office vide the order dated 20.11.1991 
after affording sufficient opportunity of hearing to the allottees by issuing 
show cause notice dated 14.09.1990, however, the allottees had failed 
to clear the outstanding dues. In the appeal preferred by the said 
allottees, the Chief Administrator, Chandigarh, considering the 
submission made by the learned counsel for the allottees, had given the 
allottees last opportunity to liquidate their liability and retain the lease of 
the site in question by paying the entire amount of premium with interest 
etc., within 15 days from the date of the passing of the order dated 
12.10.1992. The respondents- allottees instead of complying with the 
said order preferred a petition before the Advisor to the Administrator 
U.T., Chandigarh after a delay of about 5 and half years, which also 
came to dismissed by the Advisor, vide order 07.04.1999 on the ground 
of being time barred. 
11.  Similar challenge made by the so-called tenant of the said allottees i.e., 
M/s. Mohit Medicos also came to be dismissed by the Advisor.  Under 
the circumstances, despite sufficient opportunities of hearing given to 
the allottees to clear the outstanding dues, the respondents – allottees 
had failed to clear the same. Hence, the High Court had committed 

8 
 
gross error in allowing the writ petitions by holding that the tenant, i.e., 
M/s. Mohit Medicos was not served with the notice of resumption with 
regard to the plot in question. Admittedly, there was no document 
whatsoever produced by the said alleged tenant to show that it was the 
tenant of the original allottees - Manjit Kumar Gulati and Ors. When the 
original allottees themselves had failed to comply with the conditions of 
auction sale, and when the allotment itself made in favour of the said 
allottees was cancelled by the Statutory Authority after following the due 
process of law, i.e., by issuing show cause notice before cancellation of 
allotment, and when number of opportunities of hearing were given to 
the allottees to clear the outstanding dues, there was no question of 
serving any notice to the so called tenant, M/s. Mohit Medicos, 
especially when there was nothing on record to suggest that M/s. Mohit 
Medicos was the tenant of the original allottees - Manjit Kumar Gulati 
and Ors. The High Court had completely lost sight of the said factual 
aspects of the matter while allowing the writ petitions filed by the 
respondents  – allottees and the so called tenant – M/s. Mohit Medicos. 
The decision of FULL Bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court relied 
upon by the learned senior counsel for the respondent(s) - tenant has 
no application to the facts of the present case, inasmuch as the 
respondent(s) – M/s. Mohit Medicos, by no stretch of imagination could 
be said to be a tenant of the original allottees, in absence of any material 

9 
 
placed on record, to substantiate the same. The litigation carried forward 
by the said alleged tenant is nothing but a proxy litigation on behalf of 
the original allottees, who were the defaulters and an abuse of process 
of law.  
12. In that view of the matter, the impugned order passed by the High Court 
being erroneous is set aside. The Appeals are allowed accordingly.
