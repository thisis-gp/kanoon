2. 
This common judgment decides the cross appeals which impugn the judgment 
dated 05.01.2010, of the Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh 
in Writ Petition Nos. 7956, 7997, and 23682 of 2008. These Writ Petitions 
challenged the allotment of land parcels, vide several State Government 
Memoranda1, within the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation limits. The 
land was allocated to Cooperative Societies composed of members of various 
groups, including Members of Parliament2, Members of both houses of the 
State Legislature3, officers of All India Services4, Judges of the Supreme Court 
and High Court5, State Government employees, defence personnel, journalists 
and individuals from weaker sections of society. 
 
3. 
The High Court, in the impugned judgment, has partly allowed the Writ 
Petitions, quashing the GoMs that laid down the allotment policy and facilitate 
the allotments to the Cooperative Societies. It held that the parcels of land 
allotted to the respondents were to be restored to the Government, and that 
fresh allotments can only be made following the issuance of appropriate GoMs 
consistent with the judgment. The High Court further directed that before such 
GoMs are issued, the State shall call for details of members who meet the 
eligibility criteria; ensure they sign affidavits declaring their eligibility; and 
publish this information on its website for public access. Any false declaration 
will result in cancellation of the allotment, and initiation of civil and criminal 
proceedings.

are not seeking allotment, we have addressed their category for the purpose of tackling the legal issue 
arising out of allotment made under GoM No. 243.

4. 
While the Cooperative Societies, their members, and the State of Telangana6 
have preferred appeals contesting these directions, Mr. Keshav Rao Jadhav, 
the petitioner in Writ Petition No. 23682/2008, has filed a cross-appeal. Mr. 
Keshav Rao Jadhav prays that preferential allotment of land – particularly at 
basic rates – to MLAs, MPs, journalists, officers of the AIS and Judges, is 
illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional, as it violates the right to equality 
guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. 
 
FACTS OF THE CASE 
5. 
On 28.02.2005, the Government of Andhra Pradesh issued three GoMs – Nos.  
242, 243 and 244. GoM No. 242 established a comprehensive policy for 
managing land resources and housing in urban and semi-urban areas. GoM 
No. 243 outlined categories of individuals eligible for land allotment, while GoM 
No. 244 provided guidelines for this process.  
 
6. 
GoM No. 242 emphasized the urgent need for prudent management of land 
resources in urban and semi-urban areas due to rising urbanization and 
increasing demand for housing. Due to growing urbanisation, demand for land 
for housing purposes has surged. It highlighted the challenges faced by the 
working middle class, as private developers often artificially inflate land prices, 
making it difficult for them to secure plots. Recognizing that providing shelter 
is a top priority for the State, the Government had previously formulated a 
housing scheme for the poor. However, there was no fixed policy catering to 
“other deserving sections” of the society. Consequently, the Government 
 
6 Refer to the order dated 30.03.2016 passed by this Court, giving directions for amendment in the 
Cause Title. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 4 of 64 
 
decided that a comprehensive policy was necessary, leading to the issuance 
of GoM No. 242. Key stipulations of the GoM include: 
• Creation of a land bank, source-pooled for allotment to various housing 
Cooperative Societies and other target groups.  
• The source of the land bank would consist of land located in and around 
120 municipalities with clear titles.  
• The land would be within a radius of 25 kilometres for Category “A” 
municipalities, 15 kilometres for Category “B” municipalities and 10 
kilometres for Category “C” municipalities.  
• Government land available with various departments which was not 
being used for specified categories such as Horticulture, Agriculture, 
Roads and Buildings amongst other categories, was also to be 
subsumed and put in the land bank.  
• Surplus ceiling land, endowment lands and private lands that had been 
acquired were to also form a part of the land pool.  
• Revenue department was responsible for collecting details of large 
chunks of available land which would fall in the said categories.  
• The Collector and District Magistrate was nominated as the Competent 
Authority for transfer of the government land to the land bank in 
consultation with concerned government departments.  
• The Collector and District Magistrate would also be competent to 
acquire private land for public purposes, after examining the demand 
and after consulting the agencies in-charge of the land bank.  
• Each category of land was to be treated as a distinct entity till the same 
was alienated to the applicant. The objective was to plough back the 
cost of land acquisition.  

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 5 of 64 
 
• The Empowered Committee chaired by the Chief Commissioner of Land 
Administration and comprising five members was vested with the power 
to decide allotment of the land, its apportionment and its use, based 
upon the hierarchy of needs, and submit proposals to the Government. 
•  The designated officers who would be the members of the Empowered 
Committee, while recommending allotment of land in favour of the 
Cooperative Societies, would also recommend the price to be fixed for 
the land proposed for allotment.  
• The recommended price was to be fixed after taking into account the 
acquisition cost of land, activity of the beneficiary institution and demand 
for the land.  
• Separate orders were to be issued on the methodology to be adopted 
for selecting the housing society/institution for allotment of land from the 
land bank; deciding conditions of allotment; and ownership rights. 
 
7. 
On 28.02.2005, GoM No. 243 was also issued. It stated that land from the land 
bank could be allotted for housing and institutional purposes. For housing, the 
Government encouraged allocation of land for independent housing sites in 
areas where such housing schemes were prevalent, and for the construction 
of flats in regions where flats were established. The key stipulations of the GoM 
are outlined below: 
• The Government might alienate lands, preferably for construction of 
flats in view of land scarcity, in the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad, 
Warangal, Vijayawada, Guntur, Rajahmundry, Visakhapatnam, Kurnool 
and Nellore.  

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 6 of 64 
 
• Land was not to be allotted to individual beneficiaries, but to groups or 
Cooperative Societies of which the beneficiaries would be members.  
• A Cooperative Society or group was to have a minimum of 12 eligible 
members.  
• The applications for allotment of flat/housing site were to be made to the 
Collector and District Magistrate, who in turn had to obtain necessary 
approval for land allotment from the Empowered Committee and the 
Government.  
• The Collector was to be nominated as the Nodal Authority and was 
tasked with the duty to make the Scheme operational.  
• For allotment of the land to institutions, the Collector was to submit the 
proposal to the Empowered Committee.  
• The allotment for the Cooperative Societies comprising Judges, MPs, 
MLAs, officers of the AIS, officers of the Andhra Pradesh cadre, officers 
of other State cadres who were natives of Andhra Pradesh and who had 
worked on deputation with the Andhra Pradesh Government, officers of 
the Government of Andhra Pradesh, and journalists, would be in 
satellite towns of Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy districts.  
• The lands located in prime locations would only be allotted to 
government organisations for public purposes or for institutional use.  
• Government lands located in the proposed Outer Ring Road would not 
be allotted for housing sites for group of individuals or Cooperative 
Housing Societies.  
• The Cooperative Society or group concerned which would be allotted 
land by the Government, shall further allot individual housing sites/flats 
to its individual members. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors.

• Land would be allotted without any development, which had to be 
undertaken by the Cooperative Society or group.  
• Time limit fixed for the completion of development of land and 
infrastructure facilities (road, water supply, electricity etc.) was one year 
from the date of alienation of land, failing which the land would be 
repossessed by the government.  
• Cost and categorisation of sections of the society was prescribed in the 
following manner:

The land shall be allotted to the categories figuring at Sl. No. i 
to iv at the basic value of the land; for category v and viii at 
prevailing market value; for category vi on free of cost and for 
category vii as per the policy of the Government in vogue. The 
acquired land shall be alienated on cost basis, which means 
that the actual cost paid to the landowners shall be fixed as 
cost of land.”

9. 
Thereafter, on 04.05.2006, the Government of Andhra Pradesh issued GoM 
No. 522. The GoM stated that based upon representations from various 
individuals or groups i.e., Judges of the High Court, MLAs, MPs, officers of the 
AIS, people of eminence and journalists, the Collector of Ranga Reddy District 
had proposed allotment of government land for housing purpose on payment 
of basic value through the Chief Commissioner of Land Administration, 
Hyderabad. The Government, after careful examination of the proposal, had 
directed allotment of government land to the extent of 245 acres in villages of 
Ranga Reddy District in favour of Judges of the High Court, MLAs, MPs, 
serving left over officers of pre-1989 AIS batches, AIS officers serving since 
1989, serving AIS officers of other cadre with Andhra Pradesh nativity, people 
of eminence and working journalists, as a one-time benefit as per their 
eligibility. The allotment was made in relaxation of the order issued in GoM No. 
243 dated 28.02.2005, subject to the guidelines and filing of affidavit proforma 
1 and 2 appended to the order. The stipulations of the GoM were:- 
• 72 acres of land was to be allotted in Survey No. 276 of Puppalaguda 
Village, Rajendranagar Mandal to the MLAs and MPs. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 13 of 64 
 
• 38 acres of land was to be allotted in Survey No. 149 of Nanakramguda 
Village, Rajendranagar Mandal in favour of Judges, people of eminence, 
and serving left over officers of pre-1989 AIS batches. 
• 32 acres of land was to be allotted in Survey No. 454/1 of Puppalaguda 
Village, Rajendranagar Mandal in favour of serving post-1989 AIS officers 
and serving AIS officers of other cadre with Andhra Pradesh nativity who 
are working or had worked on deputation in Andhra Pradesh. 
• 33 acres of land was to be allotted in Survey No. 132 of Vattinagulapalli 
Village to AIS officers serving post 1989, in the order of seniority. 
• 32 acres of land was to be allotted in Survey No. 332 of Nizampet Village 
and 38 acres of land was to be allotted in Survey No. 35/2 of Pet 
Basheerabad Village to media persons.  
• Judges of the High Court, MPs, MLAs, serving AIS officers and persons 
of eminence were to be allotted plots of 500 square yards.  
• Former members of the Legislative Assembly, their widows and working 
journalists were to be allotted plots of 300 square yards.  
• The land was to be allotted to Hyderabad Urban Development Authority,10 
which in turn would develop layouts in the five blocks at the respective 
locations for allotment of housing sites to individuals.  
• Advance possession of the land would be given to HUDA. 
•  HUDA will commence work from its own reserves. Each allottee would 
reimburse the said amount to HUDA as per the time schedule fixed. 
• Format of the townships was to be based on the gated community 
concept. 
 
10 For short, “HUDA”. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 14 of 64 
 
• Appendix to the GoM stated that the allotment to the members of 
Legislature, Judiciary, Executive and the press was a one-time beneficial 
measure, irrespective of any other private ownership of land, to ensure 
equity and to avoid discrimination.  
• The appendix laid down the details including approximate number of 
housing sites etc. with stipulation regarding the size of the plots which 
would be allotted.  
• The general conditions of eligibility read: 
o Members of the categories listed at serial no. 3 to 6 under item 1, 
i.e. Judges of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, AIS officers, 
persons of eminence and journalists, should not have availed any 
benefit of allotment of land in the cities of Hyderabad, 
Secunderabad, and Ranga Reddy district or any other district. 
o All the sitting MLAs and MPs were to be given a plot, provided they 
did not have a house or housing site in Hyderabad or 
Secunderabad.  
o All eligible persons who were being allotted the land would have to 
file an affidavit agreeing to the conditions and stipulations.  
o No person who was allotted a plot shall alienate or transfer it using 
the instrument of General Power of Attorney11 within a period of 10 
years from the date of allotment.  
• Committees and sub-committees were formed to process allotment 
applications.  
 
11 For short, “GPA”. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 15 of 64 
 
• Government would allot land to HUDA at the basic rate, and as already 
noted above, HUDA would develop layouts in the five blocks at the 
respective locations. 
• The allottees were to pay the actual cost of the plot, i.e., the basic value 
plus cost of development, as worked out by HUDA, in three equal 
instalments, within six months from the date of allotment.  
• The plot will not be handed over and registered till full payment is made 
by the allottee to HUDA.  
• In case of default, the Screening Committee could recommend the 
Government to delete such names from the list.  
• Construction of houses was to commence within a period of two years 
from the date of handing over the plot to the individual allottee. 
 
10. 
GoM No. 522 dated 04.05.2006, was challenged by Mr. V.S. Bose, Dr. Rao 
V.B.J. Chelikani and Mr. O.M. Debara in the High Court in Writ Petition No. 
13730 of 2006. It was submitted that: 
• Land worth Rs. 700 crores was sought to be allotted to the specified 
categories at a throw-away price compared to the market value.  
• The government, as a trustee of the public land, cannot dispose of land 
except by way of a policy which was consistent with Articles 14, 38 and 
39(d) of the Constitution of India.  
• Majority of the beneficiaries were affluent persons with good social 
standing.  
• Land prices have escalated substantially and hence, land allotment at 
basic value without auction was detrimental to public interest.  

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 16 of 64 
 
• There was no rational basis or object which was sought to be achieved 
through such a land allotment policy.  
• Lastly, there was no justification for allotting the land to preferred 
individuals at a fraction of the market value.  
• GoM No. 243 had completely prohibited allotment of land to individuals 
who had already received benefit of concessional allotment from the 
Government. This requirement was deleted/removed through GoM No. 
522. The policy also permitted allotment of land to those who own or 
possess land in their own name or in the name of their spouse or 
children. Reference was made to the amendment made vide GoM No. 
1424 dated 28.09.2006. 
 
11. 
The Writ Petition was allowed by judgment dated 08.10.2007. At the outset, 
we must notice that the judgment of the Division Bench specifically recorded 
that the petitioners therein had not questioned the vires of GoM Nos. 242, 243 
and 244, which established the policy, categories, and guidelines for land 
allocation. Therefore, the validity of these GoMs was not examined. The focus 
of the Writ Petition concerning GoM No. 522 was the relaxation of conditions 
which had been prescribed in the earlier GoMs. 
 
12. 
The High Court referred to Rules 3 and 10 of the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana 
Area) Alienation of State Lands & Land Revenue Rules, 1975,12 which pertain 
to the alienation of land to local authorities. The Court recorded that according 
to the 1975 Rules, land acquired by the State could be alienated to a local 
body/authority for unremunerative public purposes without charging a price. 
 
12 For short, “1975 Rules”. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 17 of 64 
 
However, when the land was to be allocated for remunerative public purposes 
or to private entities, it could only be done at market value. Rule 10 allows the 
Government to deviate from the established procedures. However, any such 
deviation must follow a reasonable process for land alienation, including 
auction, where such alienation/sale is deemed necessary.  
 
13. 
The Court noted that a reading of GoM No. 522 made it clear that it relaxed 
the conditions of GoM No. 243, with the intent of providing undue benefits to 
individuals who would not otherwise qualify for land allotment under GoM No. 
243. The relaxation was made in favour of (i) Sitting and former MLAs, 
including widows of deceased MLAs; (ii) Sitting MPs from Andhra Pradesh in 
Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha; (iii) Judges of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh; 
(iv) AIS officers; (v) Persons of eminence and (vi) Journalists. There was no 
justification for allotting land to these categories of persons by relaxing 
conditions, to make them eligible for allotment of land even if they had a house 
in their name, or in the name of their spouse or children, or had earlier been 
allotted a plot of land at a concessional rate, provided they did not have any 
house in the cities of Hyderabad or Secunderabad. The Appendix to GoM No. 
522, which lists the categories of beneficiaries entitled to the relaxation, only 
states that the allotment to such categories was done irrespective of their 
private possessions, in order to “ensure equity and avoid discrimination”. The 
Court found no plausible reason for relaxing the restrictions outlined in GoM 
No. 243, stating that the revised policy under GoM No. 522 was contrary to 
public interest and it favoured certain individuals at the cost of the public 
exchequer.  The State was unjustifiably giving the benefit of concessional land 
allotment to some affluent persons, who had no pressing need for housing 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 18 of 64 
 
sites, while depriving the persons who were genuinely in need of a housing 
plot. Further, the State was also losing out on a substantial amount of revenue 
that it could have generated by duly auctioning the Government land instead 
of allotting it at such low rates. 
 
14. 
The Court held that the principle of equality had been undermined by the policy. 
GoM No. 1424, dated 28.09.2006, was deemed consistent with GoM No. 243, 
with the stipulation that the restrictions outlined in GoM No. 243 would apply to 
land allotted by the Cooperative Society to its members. The High Court held 
that the Government would be well advised to impose additional restrictions 
against allotments to individuals who owned a house in their name or that of 
their spouse or children, and this recommendation should apply to the 
allotments made to Respondent No. 4 therein. The directive of the High Court 
did not preclude the Government from making allotments in accordance with 
the policy under GoM No. 243. It was also open for the identified category of 
individuals to form a new society and submit the necessary registration 
applications.  
 
15. 
Following this judgment, the State of Andhra Pradesh issued six GoMs (Nos. 
419 to 425), all dated 25.03.2008, although GoM No. 421 was later rescinded. 
GoM No. 419 states that, based on representations from the four wings—
Legislature, Judiciary, Executive, and Media—land allotments for housing sites 
had been made under GoM No. 522, albeit the same was subsequently struck 
down by the High Court on 08.10.2007. The Court had directed the 
Government that it would be well advised to incorporate additional restrictions 
for those who owned a house or housing site in their name or that of their 
spouse or children. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors.

16. 
In issuing GoM No. 1424, which allocated land for Respondent No. 4 therein, 
the Government confirmed that all restrictions in GoM No. 243 would apply to 
those allotments. The Government decided to accept and implement the order 
of the High Court and to allot housing sites to members and societies according 
to GoM Nos. 242, 243, and 244. Consequently, 3.25 acres of government land 
in Puppalaguda Village, Rajendranagar Mandal, Ranga Reddy District, was 
earmarked for allotment to Uday Civil Services Cooperative Mutually Aided 
House Building Society, specifically for AIS officers with Andhra Pradesh 
nativity and those who had worked or were working in the State for at least 
three years.  
 
17. 
The allotment was to be done at the basic value of land per acre as on 
04.05.2006, for housing purposes. Conditions specified in GoM No. 419 
included adherence to the policies outlined in GoM Nos. 242, 243, and 244. 
Members who had received any prior allotment at a concessional rate, either 
directly or through a society, would not be eligible. Members in service as on 
29.04.2006, would qualify, and in cases where both spouses were employed, 
only one would be eligible. Development of the land would be carried out by 
the Cooperative Society or a designated agency, adhering to applicable zoning 
regulations. Each member was eligible for a plot of 500 square yards, and no 
allottee could transfer or dispose of the land via GPA for a period of ten years 
from the date of allotment. Allotments were to be made within six months of 
the alienation date. A member who was allotted a housing site was to complete 
the construction of the house within a period of two years. Affidavit would be 
furnished by every allottee on a non-judicial stamp paper in accordance with 
the prescribed format.

18. 
On similar terms and conditions, vide GoM No. 420, an allotment of 72 acres 
of land in Puppalaguda Village, Rajendranagar Mandal, Ranga Reddy district, 
was made to Indira Legislators Mutually Aided Cooperative Housing Society 
Limited on the basic value of land. It was further stipulated that MLAs and MPs 
who have previously been allotted a housing site on a concessional rate, either 
directly or as party of any society, would not be eligible for allotment. 
 
19. 
 GoM No. 422 provided for allotment of 48.15 acres of land in Puppalaguda 
Village, Rajendranagar Mandal, Ranga Reddy District to Adarshnagar Mutually 
Aided Cooperative Housing Society on payment of the basic value of land per 
acre as on 04.05.2006 on the same terms and conditions. Allotment of 16 acres 
of land at Nanakramguda Village, Serilingapalli Mandal, Ranga Reddy District, 
was made in favour of Koh-Ei-Noor Civil Services MACHSL, Hyderabad 
Officers of AIS pre-1989 service, vide GoM No. 423 on payment of the basic 
value of land per acre on 04.05.2006 on similar terms. GoM No. 424 was for 
allotment of 32 acres in village Nizampet and 38 acres in Pet Basheerabad 
village in Qutubullapur Mandal, Ranga Reddy District in favour of Jawaharlal 
Nehru Journalists Mutually Aided Cooperative Housing Society Limited on 
payment of the basic value of land per acre as existing on 04.05.2006. 
However, in this case, each member was eligible for 300 square yards of land. 
Other terms and conditions were the same. GoM No. 425 refers to three letters 
– two letters written by the Collector, Ranga Reddy District and one by the 
Chief Commissioner of Land Administration, Hyderabad, furnishing the 
Collector’s proposal, which reported the requisition made by the Indian 
Revenue Service Officers Housing Society for allotment of 50 acres of 
Government 
land 
for 
housing 
purposes 
in 
Puppalaguda 
Village, 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors.

Rajendranagar Mandal. The Government had carefully considered the 
proposal and had agreed to allot 30 acres of land in Gopannapalli Village, 
Serilingampally Mandal, Ranga Reddy District in favour of Indian Revenue 
Service13 Officers (Income Tax) Housing Society on payment of the basic 
value. The conditions relating to the basic value on allotment within Outer Ring 
Road project prescribed in GoM No. 243 were relaxed in favour of the 
Cooperative Society. The terms and conditions fixed as per the annexure 
stipulate that the IRS officers should be natives of Andhra Pradesh, working in 
Andhra Pradesh or any other part of the country. In case of non-Andhra IRS 
Officers, one should have worked a minimum of 5 years in Andhra Pradesh 
and should be serving in Andhra Pradesh as on 01.01.2008. If not a native of 
Andhra Pradesh, one should have declared any place in Andhra Pradesh as 
his hometown/place of settlement after retirement, through a formal declaration 
to Income Tax Department. Each eligible member was to be allotted 500 
square yards. A member already allotted land by any other government was 
not eligible. An allottee was not entitled to alienate/transfer/dispose of the land 
using the instrument of GPA for a period of 10 years from the date of allotment. 
Through GoM No. 451 dated 27.03.2008, land was allotted to A.P. S.P. 
MACHS Ltd. to the extent of 21 acres, on somewhat identical terms.  
 
20. 
After the said notification was issued, the three Writ Petitions mentioned in 
paragraph 1 above were filed. The lead Writ Petition No. 7956/2008 was filed 
by Dr. Rao V.B.J. Chelikani who was also a co-petitioner in the first Writ Petition 
No. 13730/2006. In addition, M/s Campaign for Housing and Tenural Rights 
(CHATRI) filed Writ Petition No. 7997/2008 and Mr. Keshav Rao Jadhav filed

21. 
The housing Cooperative Societies were also made parties to the said Writ 
Petitions. In Writ Petition No. 7956/2008, the petitioner prayed for striking down 
GoM Nos. 419 to 425 dated 25.03.2008 and GoM No. 551 dated 27.03.2008, 
as being illegal, arbitrary, unconstitutional, without jurisdiction, void ab initio 
and being in violation of the fundamental rights and the judgment of the High

Writ Petition filed by M/s Campaign for Housing and Tenural Rights (CHATRI) 
and Keshav Rao Jadhav, the petitioners prayed for setting aside the 
categorisation and guidelines of the policy itself, as envisaged under GoM No. 
243 and GoM No. 244 dated 28.02.2005, along with striking down the 
consequential allotment of lands to Respondent Nos. 4 to 11 vide GoM Nos. 
419 to 425 dated 25.03.2008 and GoM No. 551 dated 27.03.2008. All the 
above GoMs were challenged as being arbitrary and opposed to public

interest, as well as violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and being 
contrary to the judgment dated 08.10.2007, in Writ Petition 13730/2006. 
Reference was also made to Rule 10 (a) of the 1975 Rules. 
IMPUGNED JUDGMENT 
22. 
The High Court rejected the preliminary submission made by the Respondents 
on the principle of res judicata in the second round of litigation. However, the 
Court held that principles of constructive res judicata would apply, emphasizing 
that the petitioners in Writ Petition No. 13730/2006 should also have 
challenged GoM Nos. 243 and 244. Reference was made to the judgments of 
this Court in Forward Construction Company and Others v. Municipal 
Corporation of Greater Bombay,14 and State of Karnataka and Another v. 
All India Manufacturers Organisation and Others,15 stating that in public 
interest litigations, when Writ Petitions are filed on identical grounds, the 
principles of res judicata and constructive res judicata are applicable.  
 
23. 
The question of locus standi was decided in favour of the petitioners, who were 
recognized as public-spirited individuals espousing a public cause. The High 
Court held that the petitioners could legitimately claim that the measures for 
land allotment concern not only them but also the public at large. The plea of 
laches was dismissed, as the fresh allotment made after the judgment dated 
08.10.2007, in Writ Petition 13730/2006, constituted a fresh cause of action. 
The Court further stated that the Writ Petitions acted as a class action.  
 
24. 
Regarding the validity of GoM Nos. 419, 420, and 422 to 425, the High Court 
noted that the earlier decision dated 08.10.2007, in Writ Petition 13730/2006, 
 
14 (1986) 1 SCC 100. 
15 (2006) 4 SCC 683. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 25 of 64 
 
had outlined restrictions on land allotment for individuals who had already 
received similar government concessions, either directly or through 
Cooperative Societies. Contrary to the Respondents' claims, the Division 
Bench did not leave the final decision solely to the Government. It observed 
that the new GoM Nos. 419 to 425 failed to bar allotment to individuals who 
already owned land in their own name or that of their spouse or children. The 
earlier decision was unequivocal in stating that the principle of equality had 
been violated, as it did not restrict allotment of land to those who had already 
been allotted land at concessional rates or who privately owned a house or 
housing site.  
 
25. 
The High Court further noted that while the earlier Division Bench could have 
quashed GoM No. 522, it chose to give the government an opportunity to 
comply with its directions. It went on to observe that the government improperly 
issued the new GoMs, rendering them invalid. It held that the allotment of land 
to those who already owned land in their own name or in the name of their 
spouse or children, cannot be sustained. As a result, the Division Bench 
quashed all the GoMs in its judgment dated 05.01.2010, and directed that the 
various parcels of land be restored to the Government. Fresh allotments could 
be made only after issuing new GoMs in accordance with the High Court's 
directions.  
 
CONTENTIONS AND ARGUMENTS RAISED BY THE PARTIES 
26. 
To avoid prolixity and repetition, we will not separately refer to the arguments 
raised by the counsels for Cooperative Societies and their members as well as 
State of Telangana on one side, and the counsel for the Writ Petitioners, who, 
as noted above, have also challenged the impugned judgment. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 26 of 64 
 
 
27. 
The contentions and pleas raised by the counsel for the Cooperative Societies, 
its members, and State of Telangana, can be crystallised as: 
(i) 
Successive governments have allotted lands in Hyderabad at 
concessional rates till 1989. 
(ii) 
The GoM Nos. 419 to 425 were issued after almost 18 years for 
allotment of housing sites as a one-time benefit. 
(iii) 
Allotment to members of AIS, government service, etc. on preferential 
basis does not violate Article 14 of the Constitution of India, as these 
officers constitute a separate class. Government servants play a vital 
role in governance and contribute to the society through their toil and 
sacrifice. They have an unwavering commitment towards societal 
welfare and public services. However, at the same time, their salary and 
pay structures never match those of their counterparts in the private 
sector. Their carry home pay is much less than the persons with similar 
level of education and experience in the private sector. There is much 
less scope for wealth accumulation. Post-retirement benefits are also 
limited. They suffer on account of opportunity cost. Due to the 
transferable nature of their jobs, they do not have a permanent 
residence and, therefore, the scheme envisages allotment of housing 
sites to enable them to have a semblance of residential security. 
(iv) 
The allotment of housing sites, in view of the aforesaid differentiation 
and classification, has a rational nexus and objective. The policy 
provides stability to the lives of these officers and reduces dependence 
on government accommodation. It is a symbolic gesture of the 
government’s commitment to the welfare of the officers given the 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 27 of 64 
 
importance of their role and the challenges they face. No government 
largesse is given to the government employees. 
(v) 
The Cooperative Societies to whom land has been allotted have made 
substantial payments towards the price of the plots as also towards 
stamp duty.16 In many cases, the employees have retired and in some 
cases they have even died without getting benefit of the plots though 
they had made payments. Some of the societies have also undertaken 
development work at their own expense. 
(vi) 
Since journalists constitute a separate class, several Governments 
have allotted housing sites to them at concessional rates.   
(vii) 
Allotment of plots at the basic rate, is legal and valid. Price 
determination falls within the exclusive domain of the Executive. 
Procedure under the law has been duly followed. Reliance is placed 
upon Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Land Revenue Act, 1317F17 
and the alienation rules framed thereunder which we shall refer to 
subsequently.  
(viii) 
Basic market value is determined by the Collector as per the Telangana 
Revision of Market Value Guideline Rules, 1998 which have been made 
in exercise of the power under Section 47A of the Indian Stamp Act, 
 
16 The details of the payments made by some of the Cooperative Societies towards the land cost and 
infrastructure development and conversion charges is as under: 
• 
Respondent No. 4 – M/s Indira Legislators Mutually Aided Cooperative Housing Society has 
spent more than Rs. 20 crores. 
• 
Respondent No. 6 – Adarshnagar Mutually Aided Cooperative Housing Society has spent 
more than Rs. 10 crores. 
• 
Respondent No. 7 – Koh-Ei-Noor Mutually Aided Cooperative Housing Society Ltd. has spent 
around Rs. 9.75 crores. 
• 
Respondent No. 8 – Jawaharlal Nehru Journalists Mutually Aided Cooperative Housing 
Society has spent around Rs. 13.8 crores. 
• 
Respondent No. 9 – M/s Indian Revenue Services Officers’ (Income-Tax) Housing Society has 
spent around Rs. 3.9 crores.

Page 28 of 64 
 
1899. Sale value cannot be less than the basic value. Since market 
value is highly volatile, there cannot be any uniform system of 
determining the market value. It cannot be argued, therefore, that the 
land has been granted at a concessional rate as it has been sold at 
basic market value. 
(ix) 
There are enough safeguards in the impugned GoMs which ensure that 
the allotments made are not maliciously converted into a profiteering 
exercise. One such safeguard is that allotment is not made directly to 
individuals, but through a society. Further, an employee is entitled to 
such allotment only once during her/his service. A cut-off date is also 
prescribed. If both spouses are in government service, only one of them 
is eligible for land allotment. The allotment is not alienable or 
transferable by any instrument, including GPA, for a period of ten years 
from the date of allotment. 
(x) 
Allotments to specified categories also includes family members of AIS 
officers who died in harness prior to their retirement, including those 
killed by Naxalites while on duty, and had not availed facilities of 
allotment of housing sites at concessional rates. 
 
28. 
On behalf of the Writ Petitioners, it is submitted that: 
(i) 
A policy or an executive decision should be backed by a social and 
welfare purpose. It should not be for the profit or benefit of private 
individuals or a particular class. Public interest should be the paramount 
consideration. Departure from these principles should be for compelling 
reasons that must be rational and not suggestive of discrimination, bias, 
jobbery or nepotism. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 29 of 64 
 
(ii) 
Land is a natural resource and being so it should be expended to best 
subserve the common good. It should not be dissipated at a 
consideration lower than the actual worth. One set of citizens, without 
good reason and justification, cannot prosper at the cost of the other set 
of citizens.  
(iii) 
Valuable government property of around Rs. 10,000 crores belonging 
to the people of the State, which is held in trust by the State 
Government, is sought to be transferred in favour of the privileged 
section or class of persons without an overwhelming or legitimate public 
purpose. The eight categories of persons include MLAs, MPs, officers 
of the AIS, journalists, Judges of the Supreme Court and High Court, 
State Government employees, etc. 
(iv) 
The size of plots which are being sold at the basic price clearly shows 
arbitrariness and discrimination as Judges of the Supreme Court and 
High Court, MPs, MLAs, and officers of the AIS are being allotted plots 
of 500 square yards, whereas others have been allotted smaller plots. 
(v) 
Almost all MPs, MLAs, Judges of the Supreme Court and High Court, 
officers of the AIS and even journalists, already own a plot or a house 
within the State. Therefore, they should not be shown any indulgence in 
distribution of the State’s largesse which would allow them to profiteer 
at the cost of the State and the common man. 
(vi) 
The State Government had acquired 5,000 (five thousand) acres of land 
in various villages in Ranga Reddy District for Information Technology 
projects, Biotech Park, Apparel Park, Discovery City and Hardware Park 
etc. The landowners were poor agriculturists who were paid meagre 
amounts when their lands were acquired. The land is now being 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 30 of 64 
 
transferred to the privileged section of the society without a public 
auction, on payment of an amount which is much less than the market 
value. While the allottees will become rich overnight, the villagers and 
the agriculturists who were the erstwhile owners of the land, along with 
the general public and the society, will be denied the benefits of the 
surged land prices.  
(vii) 
Past allotments, if any, made contrary to law, would not justify 
allotments in the present date, if the same were in violation of the rule 
of law and Article 14 of the Constitution of India. While the State is 
entitled to frame and take policy decisions, such decisions cannot be 
arbitrary and violate the principles of equity and fairness. The 
Constitution of India does not vest absolute discretion with the 
Executive. Public interest is the paramount consideration. Land, 
including property, should be sold and disposed of by public auction or 
by inviting tender. It is the duty of the court, as a policy, to set the wrong 
right, and not allow perpetuation of the wrongdoing. 
(viii) 
Land in the concerned area is scarce, as is accepted by the Cooperative 
Societies, its members and others. This cannot be a reason to make 
preferential allotment to a select few who are the privileged or better off 
members of our society. Allotment of government land to such members 
is contrary to public interest, when a considerable portion of the 
population of the State lives below the poverty line, struggling for basic 
amenities, and is without shelter. The impugned land allotment policy is 
a cloaked attempt of the Executive at the aggrandisement of certain 
privileged groups such as bureaucrats, Judges, journalists etc. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 31 of 64 
 
(ix) 
Allotment of individual housing plots to persons belonging to weaker 
sections of the society in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy district was 
prohibited by the Government Memo dated 17.11.2004 on the ground 
that there is paucity and dearth of government land in those areas. 
Construction of only G+3 multi-storeyed flats was allowed. However, in 
case of the respondents, except for Respondent No. 1 – M/S Campaign 
for Housing and Tenural Rights (CHATRI) in C.A. No. 3792/2011, all 
Cooperative Societies have been allowed to make allotment of plots to 
its members. No principle has been followed and there is no justification 
for taking the said decision, which is without any rhyme or reason.  
(x) 
Reliance placed upon the 1975 Rules is misplaced as they do not have 
any application. Allotment of housing sites is governed by Assignment 
of House Sites in Villages & Towns in Telangana Area Rules, 1975. This 
aspect, as mentioned above, will be referred to subsequently. 
 
ANALYSIS – RES JUDICATA AND CONSTRUCTIVE RES JUDICATA 
29. 
The issue with regard to res judicata and constructive res judicata has been 
raised before us and was also argued before and considered by the High Court 
in the impugned judgment. The plea of res judicata was rejected by the High 
Court, but it upheld the plea of constructive res judicata raised by the 
Cooperative Societies, their members and the State Government. 
 
30. 
In Forward Construction Company (supra), this Court, relying upon 
Explanation (IV)18 to Section 11 of the Code of the Civil Procedure, 1908,19 
 
18 Explanation IV.—Any matter which might and ought to have been made ground of defence or attack 
in such former suit shall be deemed to have been a matter directly and substantially in issue in such 
suit. 
19 For short, “CPC”.  

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 32 of 64 
 
observed that any matter that might or ought to have been made a ground of 
attack in a former suit is deemed to have been made a matter directly or 
substantially an issue in the said suit. Therefore, res judicata impacts not only 
the actual matter determined, but every other matter which the parties might 
or ought to have litigated and have decided as incidental to, or essentially 
connected with the subject matter of the litigation. It includes every matter 
coming into the legitimate purview of the original action, both in respect of the 
matters of claim and defence. The judgment explains that the underlying 
principle in Explanation (IV) is that where the parties have had an opportunity 
of controverting a matter, that should have been taken to be the same thing as 
if the matter had been actually controverted and decided. 
 
31. 
However, in the said case the contention relying upon Explanation (IV) was 
rejected observing that when a matter has been constructively in issue, it 
cannot be said to have been actually heard and decided. Reference was also 
made to Explanation (VI) to Section 11.20 It is observed that the said 
explanation will apply when the conditions mentioned in that explanation are 
satisfied. This means that the Court should be satisfied that the decision in the 
litigation shall bind all persons interested in the right litigated. Onus of proving 
want of bona fides in respect of the previous litigation is on the parties seeking 
to avoid the said decision. Referring to the Explanation, it is said that Section 
11 applies to public interest litigation as well. Such litigation has to be a bona 
fide litigation in respect of a right which is common and agitated in common 
with others. In the said case, this Court approved the decision of the High Court 
 
20 Explanation VI.—Where persons litigate bona fide in respect of a public right or of a private right 
claimed in common for themselves and others, all persons interested in such right shall, for the 
purposes of this section, be deemed to claim under the persons so litigating. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors.

that Section 11 will not be applicable in view of the finding recorded by the High 
Court, observing that the first Writ Petition was not a bona fide one. 
 
32. 
In All India Manufacturers Organisation and Others (supra), this Court 
examined the question of res judicata observing that it is based upon larger 
public interest, being founded on two grounds: firstly, no one should be vexed 
twice for one and the same cause; and secondly, there should be an end to 
the same litigation. This Court further observed that Section 11 is a statutory 
recognition of the principle of res judicata and, therefore, not a complete code, 
or exhaustive of the general law and principle of res judicata. This Court 
thereafter observed, that a judgment in public interest litigation, when the 
litigation is bona fide, operates in rem. It binds the public at large. Thereafter, 
it examined Explanations (III) and (IV) to Section 11. Specific reference is 
made to the judgment in Greenhalgh v. Mallard,21 which observes that it would 
be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new proceeding to be started 
in respect of the same issue which has already been decided. This principle 
will equally apply to every other matter where the parties might or ought to 
have litigated. The principle applies when issues have been decided 
incidentally or essentially connected with the subject matter of litigation so as 
to come within the purview of the original action both in respect of the matter 
of claim and defence.  
 
33. 
In V. Purushotham Rao v. Union of India and Others,22 a question that arose 
before this Court was whether the principle of constructive res judicata should 
be applied as there was an earlier judgment. The contention was rejected as 
 
21 (1947) 2 All England Reporter 255 (CA). 
22 (2001) 10 SCC 305. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 34 of 64 
 
being devoid of any substance, by observing that the earlier Writ Petition under 
Article 32 was regarding cancellation of 15 allotments of petroleum and gas 
dealerships and final directions given to the High Court to dispose of the 
pending Writ Petition after examining the individual cases. Clearly, in the 
present matter also, in the first litigation and decision which has been quoted 
above, allotments made were quashed and therefore, the effect thereof was 
that none of the Cooperative Societies or its members would have been 
entitled to any benefit.  
 
34. 
A more authoritative pronouncement on the said subject is to be found in a 
recent decision of this Court in National Confederation of Officers 
Association of Central Public Sector Enterprises and Others v. Union of 
India and Others,23 wherein it takes notice of the argument relating to 
applicability of res judicata and constructive res judicata to PILs. This judgment 
not only examines the provisions of Section 11 of the CPC but the judgment of 
this Court in Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra v. State of U.P. ,24 
wherein it is observed that in PILs, every technicality in procedural law is not 
available in defence. Therefore, it would be wrong to dismiss a matter involving 
grave public importance, to entertain the plea of res judicata. Reference was 
also made to All India Manufacturers Organisation and Others (supra) 
which also elucidates the question of bona fides. It is observed that the 
petitioner therein who had filed the first litigation had special technical expertise 
on the matter to impute the project on the ground that he did. Further, the first 
judgment had references to the issue of plan, types of plan required, etc.

C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 35 of 64 
 
Lastly, the claims and the arguments raised in the second petition were largely 
and substantially same in the first petition. After referring to the first judgment, 
it is observed:  
“35. As a matter of fact, in a public interest litigation, the petitioner 
is not agitating his individual rights but represents the public at large. 
As long as the litigation is bona fide, a judgment in a previous public 
interest litigation would be a judgment in rem. It binds the public at 
large and bars any member of the public from coming forward before 
the court and raising any connected issue or an issue, which had 
been raised should have been raised on an earlier occasion by way 
of a public interest litigation. It cannot be doubted that the petitioner 
in Somashekar Reddy was acting bona fide. Further, we may note 
that, as a retired Chief Engineer, Somashekar Reddy had the 
special technical expertise to impugn the Project on the grounds that 
he did and so, he cannot be dismissed as a busybody. Thus, we are 
satisfied in principle that Somashekar Reddy, as a public interest 
litigation, could bar the present litigation.” 
 
35. 
The main argument raised on behalf of the Cooperative Societies and its 
members is that the principle of res judicata and constructive res judicata would 
apply in the present case. We are of the opinion that the question of res judicata 
will certainly not apply, as the previous judgment did not, as accepted by 
everyone, examine the constitutional validity of GoM Nos. 243 and 244. GoM 
Nos. 420, 422 to 425 dated 25.03.2008 had not been issued at the time the 
said judgment was pronounced and hence, could never have been challenged. 
On the question of constructive res judicata, we must accept that the same will 
have limited application to public interest litigation.  
 
36. 
The contention is that Writ Petition No. 13730 of 2006 was filed in public 
interest by Mr. V.S. Bose, Dr. Rao V.B.J. Chelikani and Mr. O.M. Debara, which 
petition was disposed of vide judgment dated 08.10.2007. The judgment, as 
noticed above, specifically records that the petitioners therein had not 
challenged GoM Nos. 243 and 244 dated 28.02.2005. However, this judgment 
had in fact quashed the allotment made in terms of GoM No. 522 dated 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 36 of 64 
 
04.05.2006, insofar as the GoM had permitted allotment of land to individuals, 
who are not members of Cooperative Societies and groups, or who may have 
received benefit of concessional allotment, either in individual capacity or as a 
member of a Cooperative Society or group to which preferential allotment had 
been made. The said judgment directed that the Government should identify 
the category of persons who may form a new Cooperative Society, get the 
same registered and make an application as a group for the purpose of 
allotment of land in terms of the policy contained in GoM Nos. 242 and 243 
dated 28.02.2005. It further ruled that all allotments must be in accordance with 
the stipulations in GoM Nos. 242, 243 and 244. Further, the Court observed 
that the Government would be well advised to incorporate a condition of 
inapplicability of the policy to those who own a house or housing site in their 
own name, or in the name of their spouse or children, so as to make it 
applicable to all future allotments. We would like to quote the relevant 
paragraphs from the judgment:  
“In the result, the writ petition is allowed and G.O.Ms.No.522, dated 
04.5.2006 is quashed insofar as it provides for allotment of land to 
individuals, who are not members of the societies/groups and who 
may have received the benefit of concessional allotment from the 
government earlier or as member of any society or group to which 
concessional allotment was made. G.O.Ms.No.1424, dated 
28.9.2006 whereby the land has been earmarked for respondent 
No.4 is declared to be in consonance with the policy contained in 
G.O.Ms.No.243, dated 28.2.2005 subject to the rider that all the 
restrictions contained in that G.O. will apply to the allotment of land 
by respondent No.4 to its members. The government will also do 
well to incorporate an additional restriction against the allotment of 
land to those who own house or house-site in their own name or in 
the name of their spouse or children and make the same applicable 
to the allotment made to respondent No.4 and all future allotments, 
which may be made in accordance with the policy enshrined in 
G.0.Ms.Nos.242 and 243 dated 28.2.2005. 
 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 37 of 64 
 
However, it is made clear that this order of ours will not preclude the 
government from making allotment to societies or groups of the 
identified categories in accordance with the policy contained in 
G.O.Ms.No.243, dated 28.2.2005 and it will be open to the identified 
categories of persons to form new society and get the same 
registered or make applications as groups for the purpose of 
allotment of land in terms of the policy contained in G.O.Ms.No.243, 
dated 28.2.2005. 
 
Before parting with the case, we consider it necessary to mention 
that the provision contained in the impugned G.O. for processing of 
the applications of the individual High Court Judges by the sub-
committee comprising Advocate General, Secretary, Legal Affairs 
and Registrar General, A.P. High Court, with senior-most among 
them being its Chairman had the pernicious effect of demeaning the 
status of the members of the superior judiciary and seriously eroding 
the confidence of the common man in the system of administration 
of justice because, then the individual Judges would have been 
required to make applications for allotment of land to the 
government and their applications would have been processed by a 
committee comprising two officers who are constitutionally 
subordinate to the High Court. It is a matter of satisfaction that the 
government has taken corrective measure, removed the offending 
clause and earmarked the land for respondent No.4, which is bound 
to be allotted to the members of the said respondent, who do not 
suffer from any disability incorporated in G.O.Ms.No.243 and the 
restriction, which may be imposed by the government in terms of 
the observations made in this order.” 
 
37. 
In view of the legal position, we reject the contention of the Cooperative 
Societies etc. that the principle of constructive res judicata should apply to our 
examination of the challenge to GOM Nos. 243 and 244. We, therefore, set 
aside the reasoning of the High Court to this extent.  
 
38. 
We believe that the principles of constructive res judicata should not have been 
applied, given the significant public interest at stake in this public interest 
litigation. It is clear that GoM Nos. 243 and 244 were not part of the challenge 
in the first litigation, as the petitioners then believed that simply quashing the 
allotments would suffice. Once the allotments were cancelled and the Writ 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 38 of 64 
 
Petition was allowed, the State of Telangana had the opportunity to re-evaluate 
the entire issue in light of the findings recorded.  
 
39. 
It will not be correct to put fetters on the members of the public in filing a Writ 
Petition challenging GoM Nos. 243 and 244 in this factual background. 
Constructive res judicata applies only when the cause of action is identical. In 
our view, the causes of action in the two litigation proceedings should not be 
considered identical, as the first litigation focused on the allotment and its terms 
and conditions. GoM Nos. 243 and 244 are separate and distinct from the 
allotment itself, and challenging these notifications constitutes a separate and 
independent cause of action. 
 
CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY OF IMPUGNED GOVERNMENT MEMORANDA 
40. 
To assess the constitutional validity of GoM Nos. 243 and 244 dated 
28.02.2005; GoM Nos. 420, 422 to 425 dated 25.03.2008 and GoM No. 551 
dated 27.03.2008; it is crucial to consider the factual context of their 
stipulations.25 The core issue at hand pertains to the distribution of State 
largesse—the generosity exercised by the State in distributing public 
resources—in this instance, public land in the State of Telangana. The term 
“State largesse” often implies a level of discretion in how these resources are 
allocated and can be seen as a reflection of a government's priorities or 
policies. Consequently, the exercise of such "generosity" or "discretion" has 
significant implications for the citizenry, their rights, and the functioning of 
democracy.  
 
 
25 See paragraphs 7 and 8 of this judgment for specifics of GoM Nos. 243 and 244.  

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 39 of 64 
 
41. 
The question that arises is – Can the Government, like any private individual, 
have the absolute discretion to frame policy, distribute resources and enter into 
a contract with whomsoever it pleases, on any terms and conditions it so 
desires?  
 
42. 
In Erusian Equipment and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of West Bengal,26 this 
question was posed to this Court. The then Chief Justice,27 on behalf of the 
Bench, responded that the Government is not like a private individual who can 
pick and choose the person with whom it will deal. When the Government is 
trading with the public, the democratic nature of Government demands equality 
coupled with an absence of arbitrariness and discrimination in such 
transactions. The activities of the Government have a public element and, 
therefore, they should be conducted with fairness and equality. The State need 
not enter into any contract with anyone, but if it does so, it must do so fairly, 
without discrimination and without adopting an unfair procedure.   
 
43. 
In Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India,28 
relying upon the principle established by Erusian Equipment (supra), this 
Court, observed: 
“…This proposition would hold good in all cases of dealing by the 
Government with the public, where the interest sought to be 
protected is a privilege. It must, therefore, be taken to be the law 
that where the Government is dealing with the public, whether by 
way of giving jobs or entering into contracts or issuing quotas or 
licences or granting other forms of largesse, the Government 
cannot act arbitrarily at its sweet will and, like a private individual, 
deal with any person it pleases, but its action must be in 
conformity with standard or norms which is not arbitrary, irrational 
or irrelevant. The power or discretion of the Government in the 
matter of grant of largesse including award of jobs, contracts,

Page 40 of 64 
 
quotas, licences, etc. must be confined and structured by 
rational, relevant and non-discriminatory standard or norm and if 
the Government departs from such standard or norm in any 
particular case or cases, the action of the Government would be 
liable to be struck down, unless it can be shown by the 
Government that the departure was not arbitrary, but was based 
on some valid principle which in itself was not irrational, 
unreasonable or discriminatory.” 
 
44. 
These principles were reiterated in Common Cause, A Registered Society 
v. Union of India,29 where this Court quashed certain petroleum pump 
allotments made by the Minister in exercise of his discretionary power. This 
Court observed:  
“22. The Government today — in a welfare State — provides 
large number of benefits to the citizens. It distributes wealth in 
the form of allotment of plots, houses, petrol pumps, gas 
agencies, mineral leases, contracts, quotas and licences etc. 
Government distributes largesses in various forms. A Minister 
who is the executive head of the department concerned 
distributes these benefits and largesses. He is elected by the 
people and is elevated to a position where he holds a trust on 
behalf of the people. He has to deal with the people's property in 
a fair and just manner. He cannot commit breach of the trust 
reposed in him by the people.” 
 
45. 
In Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of Uttar Pradesh,30  this Court unequivocally 
rejected the argument of absolute discretion of the administrative authorities 
and immunity of their action from judicial review. The Court observed: 
“21. … In our opinion, it would be alien to the constitutional 
scheme to accept the argument of exclusion of Article 14 in 
contractual matters. The scope and permissible grounds of 
judicial review in such matters and the relief which may be 
available are different matters but that does not justify the view 
of its total exclusion. This is more so when the modern trend is 
also to examine the unreasonableness of a term in such 
contracts where the bargaining power is unequal so that these 
are not negotiated contracts but standard form contracts 
between unequals.

29. It can no longer be doubted at this point of time that 
Article 14 of the Constitution of India applies also to matters 
of governmental policy and if the policy or any action of the 
Government, even in contractual matters, fails to satisfy the 
test of reasonableness, it would be unconstitutional.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
46. 
Thus, time and again, this Court has held that while the power to distribute and 
redistribute public assets and resources lie within the State’s discretion, such 
discretion is not absolute. Article 14 and the logic of equality impose fetters on 
the exercise of this discretionary power. Therefore, it cannot be questioned or 
contested that state policy and executive action must satisfy the rigours of 
Article 14.  
 
47. 
This leads us to the subsequent inquiry – how do we ascertain whether a State 
policy or executive action has violated the fetters imposed by Article 14? In 
other words, what are the tests applicable to evaluate the legality of State 
conduct in terms of Article 14? Do GoM Nos. 243 and 244 dated 28.02.2005;  
GoM Nos. 420, 422-425 dated 25.03.2008 and GoM No. 551 dated 27.03.2008 
pass the constitutional muster?   
  
48. 
The test of reasonable classification, developed several decades ago, 
continues to be a dominant test permeating our constitutional discourse. It 
consists of two prongs:  
(i) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which 
distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others 
that are left out of the group; and  
(ii) the differentia must have a rational relation with the object sought to be 
achieved by the statute/policy in question.  
 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 42 of 64 
 
49. 
Referring to the two-fold classification test, a Constitution Bench of this Court 
in Subramanian Swamy v. Director, Central Bureau of Investigation,31 
emphasised that there must be a nexus between the basis of the classification 
and the object of the legislation/policy under consideration. The Court also 
referred to its earlier Constitution Bench decision in Ram Krishna Dalmia v. 
Justice S.R. Tendolkar,32 which observes that the legislature is free to 
recognise varying degrees of harm and may confine its restrictions on 
classification to those cases where the need is most evident. However, the 
courts can interfere when there is nothing on the face of law or the surrounding 
circumstances which reasonably support the classification. In such cases, the 
presumption of constitutionality does not extend to suggesting that there are 
always undisclosed reasons for subjecting certain individuals or entities to 
discriminatory legislation. The rationale for classification may be specified in 
the statute, policy etc., or inferred from the surrounding circumstances known 
or brought to the notice of the court. 
 
50. 
In Nagpur Improvement Trust v. Vithal Rao and Others,33 a Constitution 
Bench of this Court emphasised that the object itself should be lawful and 
cannot be discriminatory. If the object is to discriminate against a section of the 
minority, such discrimination cannot be justified on the grounds of reasonable 
classification, even if it has a rational connection to the intended objective. 
 
51. 
In a reference made to this Court under Article 143(1) of the Constitution of 
India regarding the constitutional validity of the Special Courts Bill, 1978, a

Page 43 of 64 
 
seven-Judge bench of this Court in In Re: The Special Courts Bill, 1978,34 
concluded that the State possesses the authority to enact laws that operate 
differently on various groups or classes of individuals to achieve specific ends. 
Constitutional command to the State to afford equal protection of laws sets a 
goal that cannot be achieved through rigid formulae. Therefore, courts should 
not demand delusive exactness or apply doctrinaire tests. Classification is 
justified as long as it is not palpably arbitrary. Laws must be applied equally to 
all individuals placed in similar situations, and reasonable classification 
involves segregating groups based on shared properties and characteristics. 
This power of classification enables the State to recognise and deal with the 
needs and exigencies of the society as suggested by experience, which 
includes recognition of given degree of evil. What is necessary is that there 
should be a nexus between them. 
 
52. 
The basis of classification, and object of the legislation are distinct things. 
Article 14 postulates the need for a rational nexus. Therefore, mere designation 
of a classification based on an identified objective does not lead to an 
automatic satisfaction of Article 14.  Such an approach can devolve into legal 
formalism, which risks disregarding the substantive implications of the 
constitutional guarantee of equality. This Court, to avoid such formalism, has 
transitioned from an exclusive reliance on the test of classification to a 
concurrent application of the doctrine of arbitrariness when actions are not 
grounded in valid reasons. Article 14 of the Constitution prohibits class 
discrimination by conferring privileges or imposing liabilities on individuals 
arbitrarily selected from a larger group in similar circumstances concerning the 
 
34 (1979) 1 SCC 380. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 44 of 64 
 
privileges sought or the liabilities imposed. The classification must never be 
arbitrary, artificial or evasive. 
 
53. 
The foundations of arbitrariness in the context of the classification test were 
laid by Bose J. in State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar35 and 
subsequently in Kathi Raning Rawat v. State of Saurashtra36. Bose J. has 
questioned the propriety of the classification test by propounding that mere 
classification by itself is not enough, for the simple reason that anything can be 
classified and every discriminatory action must of necessity fall in some 
category of classification. Classification is nothing more than dividing of one 
group of things from another, and unless some difference or distinction is made 
in a given case, no question under Article 14 can arise. Mere classification is 
only a means of attaining the desired result. Therefore, the ends cannot be 
entirely ignored and consequently, the Court in a limited way is not precluded 
from examining the legitimacy of the legislative object.  
 
54. 
In a number of decisions of this Court, a similar approach has been taken. In 
State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa,37 this Court cautioned 
that classification can pose a danger of creating artificial inequalities and thus 
to overdo classification is to undo equality. Therefore, classification has to be 
demonstrably based upon substantive differences and should promote 
relevant goals that have constitutional validity.38 The legitimacy of the object, 
in a limited way, is a necessary element to be considered for assessing validity 
 
35 (1952) 1 SCC 1. 
36 (1952) 1 SCC 215. 
37 (1974) 1 SCC 19. 
38 Also see Hiral P. Harsora and Others v. Kusum Narottamdas Harsora and Others, (2016) 10 SCC 
165, and Union of India v. N.S. Rathnam & Sons, (2015) 10 SCC 681, where similar views have been 
expressed. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 45 of 64 
 
of any classification. The classification must be just and fair, which 
necessitates that the court scrutinizes the underlying purpose of the law. Many 
a case will ex-facie or demonstrably meet the equity compliance, some will be 
declared constitutional after in-depth judicial examination. This Court in LIC v. 
Consumer Education Centre,39 had accordingly struck down an insurance 
policy which was limited to employees of the Government or reputed 
commercial firms, as violating Article 14 on the ground that it did not meet the 
test of equality, fairness and justice. Significantly, the Court had observed that 
the doctrine of classification is simply a subsidiary rule that the judiciary has 
evolved to give practical content to the doctrine of equality. In Indian Council 
for Legal Aid and Advice v. Bar Council of India,40 the stipulation that 
advocates must be under the age of 45 for enrolment was invalidated as being 
discriminatory, despite its intention to address specific demographics. The 
criterion was found to be unreasonable and consequently, impinging upon the 
principle of equality. 
 
55. 
Thus, it is crucial to recognise that the unreasonableness of a law, policy or 
state action can be both relative and absolute. First, unreasonableness can be 
comparative, meaning it is assessed in relation to something else. In Ajay 
Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi,41 this Court stipulated that a policy in 
question must satisfy two requirements under the reasonable classification test 
– (a) the classification must be reasonable; and (b) it must fulfil the twin 
conditions of intelligible differentia and rational nexus. Second, a policy may 
perpetrate discrimination inherently, instead of inter se discrimination vis-à-vis

others. In A.L. Kalra v. Project and Equipment Corporation of India Ltd.,42 
this Court held that one need not confine the denial of equality to a comparative 
evaluation between two persons to arrive at a conclusion of discriminatory 
treatment. An action/policy can per se be arbitrary, and such arbitrariness in 
itself constitutes a violation of the equal of protection under law.   
 
56. 
It follows that the rigours of Article 14 cannot be interpreted in a narrow, 
pedantic or lexicographical manner.43 The doctrine of classification is neither a 
mere restatement of Article 14 nor is it the objective and end of that Article.44 
In a catena of judgments, this Court has held that the reasonable classification 
doctrine is a judicial formula to assess whether legislative or executive actions 
are arbitrary, thus amounting to a denial of equality.45 It is arbitrariness that lies 
at the heart of the reasonable classification test. The principle of 
reasonableness – both legally and philosophically – is an essential element of 
equality or non-arbitrariness, pervading Article 14 like a “brooding 
omnipresence”.46  
 
57. 
In recent pronouncements, this Court has clearly expounded India’s equality 
jurisprudence – from a reliance on the test of classification and arbitrariness to 
a more substantive interpretation of equality. For instance, A.K. Sikri J., in 
National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India and Others,47 had 
referred to the relationship between equality and dignity. In Navtej Johar v.

Union of India,48 D.Y. Chandrachud, J. (as his Lordship then was) explicitly 
articulated the principle of substantive equality and remarked: 
“Equating the content of equality with the reasonableness of a 
classification on which a law is based advances the cause of legal 
formalism. The problem with the classification test is that what 
constitutes a reasonable classification is reduced to a mere formula: 
the quest for an intelligible differentia and the rational nexus to the 
object sought to be achieved. In doing so, the test of classification 
risks elevating form over substance. The danger inherent in legal 
formalism lies in its inability to lay threadbare the values which guide 
the process of judging constitutional rights. Legal formalism buries 
the life-giving forces of the Constitution under a mere mantra. What 
it ignores is that Article 14 contains a powerful statement of values 
– of the substance of equality before the law and the equal 
protection of laws. To reduce it to a formal exercise of classification 
may miss the true value of equality as a safeguard against 
arbitrariness in state action. As our constitutional jurisprudence has 
evolved towards recognizing the substantive content of liberty and 
equality, the core of Article 14 has emerged out of the shadows of 
classification. Article 14 has a substantive content on which, 
together with liberty and dignity, the edifice of the Constitution is 
built. Simply put, in that avatar, it reflects the quest for ensuring fair 
treatment of the individual in every aspect of human endeavor and 
in every facet of human existence.” 
 
58. 
Similarly, in Lt. Col. Nitisha v. Union of India,49 the Court referred to 
jurisprudence relating to indirect discrimination which may also be a valid 
reason to strike down a legislation. This decision refers to the principle of 
substantive equality and that the right of equality should not be seen through 
a narrow lens. The court should examine the impact of the law, and whether 
the law or a policy adversely affects members of a particular disadvantaged 
group disproportionately. In other words, when the courts examine the 
question of rationality of a classification, they in a way also examine non-
classificatory arbitrariness. No doubt, in doing so, the court does show a 
degree of deference. There are decisions of this Court which hold that under- 
 
48 (2018) 10 SCC 1. 
49 (2021) 15 SCC 125. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 48 of 64 
 
inclusiveness will not result in invalidity of a statute, and that the State is not 
obligated to extend a policy to all such cases to which it would otherwise 
apply.50 These decisions are based on the premise that a legislation is 
permitted to recognise degrees of harm and may confine its restrictions or 
benefits to those cases where the need is the clearest. Legislative or executive 
action does not deal with absolutes.  
 
59. 
Thus, over the years, there is a discernible and marked shift from mere formal 
equality to the broader concept of substantive equality, which encompasses 
various dimensions of the principle of equality.51 On one hand, substantive 
equality focuses on correction of historical wrongs, checking stereotypes, 
stigma, prejudice etc.,52 while on the other, it also scrutinizes if a law or policy 
is inherently discriminatory. The latter principle applies when the legitimacy of 
the objective is flawed and manifests arbitrariness. We shall subsequently 
elaborate on the legal meaning of substantive equality. 
 
60. 
This evolution of the law under Article 14 aligns with judicial decisions in the 
United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and South Africa. For our purposes, 
we will refer to some decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada that exemplify 
the development of Canada's approach to equality as articulated in Section 15 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 1982.53 
 
 
50 See Ram Krishna Dalmia (supra) and Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri v. Union of India, AIR 1951 SC 41.

53 For short, “Canadian Charter”. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 49 of 64 
 
61. 
Section 15 of the Canadian Charter54 aims to provide substantive equality.55 To 
begin, in 1989, the Supreme Court of Canada, in Andrews v. Law Society of 
British Columbia,56 interpreted Section 15(1) of the Canadian Charter to 
include both direct and indirect discrimination. Subsequently, in Law v. 
Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration),57 a three-fold test was 
laid down.58 This included identifying a comparator group of individuals in 
similar circumstances and determining whether the law's disadvantage 
constituted an impairment of human dignity. The Supreme Court of Canada 
later modified the test in R. v. Kapp,59 reframing the doctrine of substantive 
equality and held that it should prevail over formal equality. The court noted 
that the human dignity aspect, included in the third part of the Law v. Canada 
(supra) test, had not achieved the intended philosophical enhancement. 
 
54 Section 15 – (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal 
protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination 
based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.  
(2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration 
of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because 
of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex or mental or physical disability. 
55 A literal reading of the Constitution of India shows that our founders envisaged a progressive and 
substantive framework of equal protection of laws. See Article 14, read with Articles 15, 16, 17, and 18 
of the Constitution of India.  
56 [1989] 1 SCR 143. 
57 [1999] 1 SCR 497. 
58 The three-part test is as follows: 
A court that is called upon to determine a discrimination claim under s. 15(1) should make the following 
three broad inquiries:  
A. Does the impugned law (a) draw a formal distinction between the claimant and others on the 
basis of one or more personal characteristics, or (b) fail to take into account the claimant’s 
already disadvantaged position within Canadian society resulting in substantively differential 
treatment between the claimant and others on the basis of one or more personal 
characteristics?  
B. Is the claimant subject to differential treatment based on one or more enumerated and 
analogous grounds?  
and 
C. Does the differential treatment discriminate, by imposing a burden upon or withholding a 
benefit from the claimant in a manner which reflects the stereotypical application of presumed 
group or personal characteristics, or which otherwise has the effect of perpetuating or 
promoting the view that the individual is less capable or worthy of recognition or value as a 
human being or as a member of Canadian society, equally deserving of concern, respect, and 
consideration?  
59 [2008] 2 SCR 483. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 50 of 64 
 
However, human dignity remains a fundamental value underlying the principle 
of equality.  
 
62. 
In the context of Section 15, which is divided into subsections (1) and (2)—the 
latter addressing reverse discrimination and ameliorative measures—the 
inquiry for classification under Kapp (supra) requires the government to 
demonstrate that a program has an ameliorative and remedial purpose and 
specifically targets a disadvantaged group identified by enumerated or 
analogous grounds. The test was further refined in Withler v. Canada 
(Attorney General),60 wherein the Supreme Court of Canada explicitly 
rejected the notion that formal equality alone is adequate, emphasizing the 
necessity of substantive equality, stating: 
“Substantive equality, unlike formal equality, rejects the mere 
presence or absence of difference as an answer to differential 
treatment.  It insists on going behind the facade of similarities and 
differences. It asks not only what characteristics the different 
treatment is predicated upon, but also whether those characteristics 
are relevant considerations under the circumstances. The focus of 
the inquiry is on the actual impact of the impugned law, taking full 
account of social, political, economic and historical factors 
concerning the group. The result may be to reveal differential 
treatment as discriminatory because of prejudicial impact or 
negative stereotyping. Or it may reveal that differential treatment is 
required in order to ameliorate the actual situation of the claimant 
group.” 
 
63. 
Thus, the Supreme Court of Canada has significantly reshaped the comparator 
group requirement, providing a broader and wider meaning to equality claims. 
The test poses two questions – (1) Does the law create a distinction based on 
an enumerated or analogous ground? and (2) Does the distinction create a 
disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotypes? The purpose of the 
distinction component is to demonstrate that the claimant has been treated 
 
60 [2011] 1 S.C.R. 396. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 51 of 64 
 
differently from others—specifically, that they have been denied a benefit 
available to others or are burdened in a way that others are not, due to personal 
characteristics that qualify as enumerated or analogous grounds. 
 
64. 
In Quebec (Attorney General) v. A,61 the court observed that substantive 
equality is not compromised merely because a disadvantage is imposed; 
rather, it is denied when that disadvantage is unfair or objectionable. This is 
often the case when the disadvantage perpetuates prejudice or stereotypes. 
Such discrimination can overlook significant harms, including marginalization, 
oppression, and the deprivation of essential benefits. The focus should be on 
the execution and impact of the law, rather than the government's intent, when 
applying this test.  
 
65. 
Section 15 is violated when distinctions lead to the perpetuation of arbitrary 
disadvantages based on an individual’s membership in an enumerated or 
analogous group. Importantly, the test requires a flexible and contextual 
inquiry. Lastly, we will refer to the decision of Fraser v. Canada (Attorney 
General),62 where the court summarized the law on the adverse effects of 
discrimination, noting that this occurs when a seemingly neutral law 
disproportionately impacts members of groups protected on the basis of 
enumerated or analogous grounds. 
 
66. 
In this manner, the development of equality jurisprudence in Canada bears 
resemblances 
with 
the 
progressive 
development 
of 
constitutional 
jurisprudence in India. In the Indian context, the mere fact that a policy caters 
 
61 [2012] 1 SCR 61. 
62 [2020] 3 SCR 113.  

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 52 of 64 
 
to a distinct, intelligible class, does not automatically imply that the rigours of 
Article 14 are satisfied. The second prong of the reasonable classification test 
mandates that the distinction created by the policy between the two classes 
must have a rational nexus with the object that policy seeks to achieve. 
Furthermore, the objective of the classification should not itself be illogical, 
unfair and unjust. 
 
67. 
The substantive equality test, as enunciated in our recent pronouncements, is 
broader and is not confined to a single principle. No doubt, it accommodates 
the legislature and the executive’s right to achieve structural change, but this 
right should be exercised to benefit those who are disadvantaged, 
marginalized, or those in need or grouped, while excluding others from the 
benefit or for imposition of the burden or obligation. It is crucial for the Court to 
consider both the intent behind legislation or policy and its practical impact, 
especially when it reflects discrimination based on proscribed grounds.63 
 
68. 
Substantive equality is satisfied when the law or policy genuinely intends to 
and provides, an equal chance of satisfying the criteria for access to a 
particular social or economic good. It respects individual dignity, which 
encompasses three characteristics: (i) a sense of self-worth, (ii) protection of 
basic choices an individual makes, and (iii) protection of individuals against 
harmful stereotypes. Lastly, substantive equality is achieved when legislation 
or policies enhance participation and representation, countering both political 
and socio-economic exclusion. The last aspect permits anti-subordination, as 
it focuses on the group which has suffered the disadvantage and examines 
 
63 The expression “proscribed grounds” has reference to Articles 15 to 18 of the Constitution of India. 
These Articles and their impact on Article 14, have been examined later.  

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 53 of 64 
 
whether the legislation or policy aims at neutrality or incorporates affirmative 
action to rectify the disadvantage or discrimination. Anti-subordination 
promotes structural change and aims to rectify disadvantages. In this sense, 
substantive equality factors in multiple aspects of inequality offering a 
multidimensional approach that allows the Court to address the interplay of 
various aspects of equality, and equally accommodate differences instead of 
masking them with formal equality.64 
 
69. 
A literal reading of the Constitution’s equality provisions – Articles 14, 15, 16, 
and 17 which collectively form the core of equality – supports an interpretation 
of substantive equality. While these Articles are broadly interconnected, they 
also confer independent rights. Article 18, which prohibits the granting of titles 
to Indian citizens, aligns with this objective, serving as a response to the 
colonial practice of elevating certain Indians over others.  
 
70. 
Article 15(1) explicitly bars discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, 
caste, sex, and place of birth. These can be loosely called proscribed grounds 
for classification.65 Classifications based on these criteria will be 
unconstitutional, unless permitted by clauses (3), (4), (5), and (6) of Article 15 
of the Constitution of India, when they are justified on the ground of anti-
subordination. Latter clauses specifically permit the State to create special 
provisions for women and children, and for the advancement of socially and 
educationally backward classes, including Scheduled Castes and Scheduled 
 
64 Supra note 50. 
65 However, as held, classification on the basis of proscribed grounds is not forbidden vide Article 14, 
albeit it should satisfy principles of anti-subordination and non-arbitrariness. Classification based on 
proscribed grounds must at the same time, to be valid, independently meet the mandate of Articles 15 
to 18 of the Constitution. Articles 15 to 18 confer independent rights to equality, which are not diluted 
or foregone in compliance to Article 14. However, it would be rare that such a situation would arise, 
once the test of substantive equality is satisfied. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 54 of 64 
 
Tribes. These are anti-subordination grounds.66 The clauses permit provisions 
for their admission to educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the 
State, with the exception of minority educational institutions. Under Article 
15(6), the State is authorized to enact laws for the economically weaker 
sections, allowing for up to ten percent reservation in employment. Article 16, 
which deals with equality of opportunity in matters of public employment, 
prohibits discrimination of any citizen on the ground or religion, race, caste, 
sex, place of birth or residence. However, it permits the State to make 
provisions for reserving appointments for backward classes that are 
inadequately represented, as well as for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled 
Tribes in State services. 
 
71. 
Article 14, which provides for equality before the law, and mandates that the 
State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or equal protection 
of laws, does not specifically refer to a particular classification unlike Articles 
15 and 16 of the Constitution, allowing greater legislative flexibility. This design 
is intentional; the framers understood that rigid classifications could hinder the 
legislature’s ability to address emerging societal issues and adapt to the 
evolving needs of future generations. By avoiding specificity, the Constitution 
enables lawmakers to make laws on futuristic grounds which may arise with 
the struggles and challenges faced by the new generation.67 
 
 
66 Anti-subordination grounds refer to the objectives of the legislation. They are not classifications. As 
in case of proscribed grounds for classification, in case of anti-subordination grounds, the court’s 
scrutiny is not totally prohibited, albeit substantive equality test will be satisfied when anti-subordination 
principle is not violated, and the classification does not result in indirect discrimination.  
67 See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 US 558, which dealt with the 14th amendment to the United States 
Constitution, observes that the framers knew that times could blind them to certain truths and later 
generations could see the laws once thought necessary and proper, in fact, serve only the oppressed. 
The Constitution endures, a person of every generation can invoke its principles in search for greater 
freedom. 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 55 of 64 
 
72. 
Therefore, this Court has taken the view that Article 14 allows for reasonable 
and fair classification but prohibits class legislation. Classifications based on 
the categories outlined in Articles 15 and 16 are acceptable as long as they 
have a rational connection to their intended objectives. These classifications—
such as those pertaining to other backward classes, scheduled castes and 
tribes, and women and children—aim to fulfil the principle of equal ends. This 
approach accepts and accommodates the said difference. They adopt an anti-
subordination approach, treating these groups differently to promote greater 
equality. In this manner, Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India explicitly 
recognize the necessity for legislative measures aimed at uplifting certain 
disadvantaged sections to achieve equality.  
 
73. 
The substantive equality test will also fail in case the legislation or the policy, 
in its operation, results in indirect discrimination.68 The principle of indirect 
discrimination comes into play when legislation or policy applies equally to all 
but disproportionately disadvantages individuals or groups based on protected 
characteristics, which cannot be justified. It refers to inequality of results and 
outcomes. Substantive equality also encompasses equality of opportunity, 
addressing institutional discrimination and rejecting policies that promote 
imbalances rather than equalize starting points. Policies should not impose 
additional obstacles for those requiring protection, or who have faced historical 
discrimination or do so in the present.  
 
74. 
Therefore, unless a law meets these criteria of substantive equality, it would 
violate Article 14 of the Constitution of India.

75. 
At this juncture, we will apply the law to the facts of the case. To quote from 
the GoM No. 242, the land allotment policy seeks to serve the following 
objective:  
“Providing 
shelter is amongst 
the 
top 
priorities 
of 
the 
Government. There are well defined schemes for providing 
housing for the poor. In so far as meeting the requirement of the 
other deserving sections of the society, there is no fixed 
policy and mechanism for alienation of land to such sections and 
Allotment was done case by case, for the land identified. 
Therefore, Government have decided to have a comprehensive 
policy of meeting housing requirement of targeted sections of 
society by creation of land bank and· accordingly order the 
following...” 
 
We would like to emphasise that the policy, while not targeted towards the 
poor, is also aimed towards “other deserving sections of the society”, to meet 
their “housing requirement”.  
 
76. 
The category of people who have been identified as beneficiaries of this State 
largesse as “other deserving sections of the society” are: Judges of the 
Supreme Court and High Court, MPs, MLAs, journalists, State and Central 
Government employees. It would be apt to note that, not only are these classes 
of people being allotted land preferentially, the price of such land is also 
discounted to the basic rate, instead of the prevalent market rate.  
 
77. 
The State of Telangana, in its defence, has contended that the 
abovementioned category of people forms a distinct class. However, we have 
already enunciated above that, not only must a distinct classification exist but 
such classification should not be arbitrary, artificial or artful, and should be 
rationally tailored to serve the objective.  
 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 57 of 64 
 
78. 
In the present case, the principle of arbitrariness, as expounded in E.P. 
Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu in its puritan form, is applicable.69 The 
classification giving State largesse to Judges of Constitutional Courts, MPs, 
MLAs, officers of the AIS, journalists, etc. favours a privileged segment of 
society, which is already better off compared to the vast majority of 
marginalized and socio-economically disadvantaged individuals. The benefits 
granted to these privileged and well-off classes come at a cost, as they 
effectively deprive and deny the essentials to the marginalized and socially 
vulnerable populations. 
 
79. 
The allocation of land at basic rates to select privileged groups reflects a 
“capricious” and “irrational” approach. This is a classic case of executive action 
steeped in arbitrariness, but clothed in the guise of legitimacy, by stating that 
the ostensible purpose of the policy was to allot land to “deserving sections of 
society”. Shorn of pretence, this policy of the State Government, is an abuse 
of power meant to cater exclusively to the affluent sections of the society, 
disapproving and rejecting the equal right to allotment of the common citizen 
and the socio-economically disadvantaged. It would not be wrong to say that 
the doctrine of manifest arbitrariness, as expounded in Shayara Bano v. 
Union of India is applicable.70 
 
80. 
The arbitrariness inherent in the land allocation policy is further reflected in 
GoM No. 244. This order stipulates that if the available land is insufficient to 
meet the prescribed allocations for AIS officers, the size of the plots may be 
reduced according to a specified ratio. However, an exception is carved out for 
 
69 (1974) 4 SCC 3. 
70 (2017) 9 SCC 1; also see Navtej Johar (supra) and Joseph Shine v. Union of India, (2019) 3 SCC 
39.  

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 58 of 64 
 
Category 1 beneficiaries, which includes IAS, IPS, and IFS officers. This 
category is afforded preferential treatment without any justification for such a 
distinction, highlighting an undue bias in favour of the most privileged subset 
within an already irrational classification.  
 
81. 
In this regard, members of the AIS have asserted that they are 
“underprivileged”, or have made “sacrifices”, which entitles them to the 
privilege of preferential land allotment at a discounted rate. We reject this 
argument as fallacious and untenable. Government servants, elected 
legislators, Judges in the Supreme Court and High Court, and prominent 
journalists do not belong to the “weaker” or per se deserving sections of our 
society, warranting special State reservations to land allotment.  
 
82. 
Land is a finite and highly valuable resource, particularly in densely populated 
urban areas, where access to land for housing and economic activities is 
increasingly scarce. When the government allocates land at discounted rates 
to the privileged few, it engenders a system of inequality, conferring upon them 
a material advantage that remains inaccessible to the common citizen. This 
preferential treatment conveys the message that certain individuals are entitled 
to more, not due to the necessities of their public office or the public good, but 
simply because of their status. Such practices foster resentment and 
disillusionment among ordinary citizens, who perceive these actions as corrupt 
or unjust, thereby eroding trust in democratic institutions. This policy 
undermines solidarity and fraternity, reinforcing societal hierarchies rather than 
actively working to dismantle them.  
 
83. 
The policy has wider economic ramifications as well. When land is offered at a 
discounted rate, it distorts the natural market forces that govern the value of 

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 59 of 64 
 
land. The true market price of land reflects its demand and utility, but when 
individuals receive land at a discount, it artificially devalues the property and 
consequently diminishes public revenue. This has severe financial 
ramifications for the public exchequer. 
 
84. 
In Ram & Shyam Co. v. State of Haryana,71 this Court observed that, typically, 
the State is under an obligation to sell public property only at the market price, 
with the sole exception of achieving a constitutionally recognised public 
purpose:  
“…Disposal of public property partakes the character of a trust in 
that in its disposal there should be nothing hanky panky and that 
it must be done at the best price so that larger revenue coming 
into the coffers of the State administration would serve public 
purpose viz. the welfare State may be able to expand its 
beneficient activities by the availability of larger funds. This is 
subject to one important limitation that socialist property may be 
disposed at a price lower than the market price or even for a 
token price to achieve some defined constitutionally recognised 
public purpose, one such being to achieve the goals set out in 
Part IV of the Constitution. But where disposal is for 
augmentation of revenue and nothing else, the State is under an 
obligation to secure the best market price available in a market 
economy…A welfare State exists for the largest good of the 
largest number more so when it proclaims to be a socialist State 
dedicated to eradication of poverty. All its attempt must be to 
obtain the best available price while disposing of its property 
because the greater the revenue, the welfare activities will get a 
fillip and shot in the arm…” 
 
85. 
We are also of the opinion that, accredited journalists cannot be treated as a 
separate class for such preferential treatment. In fact, a careful study of the 
policy indicates that higher echelons of all the three wings of the government, 
—legislators, bureaucrats, and Judges of the Supreme Court and High 
Courts—have been afforded such preferential treatment. Journalists, who are 
considered the fourth pillar of democracy, have also been included. These four 
 
71 (1985) 3 SCC 267.  

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 60 of 64 
 
pillars of democracy are expected to act as checks and balances on the 
arbitrary exercise of the State’s power. However, the distribution of such 
extraordinary State benefits renders nugatory the very optics of healthy checks 
and balances within our democratic system. 
 
86. 
Thus, the core framework of these policies suffers from the malaise of 
unreasonableness and arbitrariness. It reeks of colourable exercise of power 
whereby the policymakers are bestowing valuable resources to their peers and 
ilk, triggering a cycle of illegal distribution of State resources. The State holds 
all its resources in trust for its citizens, to be utilised in larger public and social 
interest. The State, including the three organs – Legislature, Executive and the 
Judiciary, are de facto trustees and agents/repositories which function and 
govern for the benefit of the citizens who are the beneficiaries.72  
 
87. 
Thus, the allotment policy fails to satisfy the requirements of the two-pronged 
classification test coupled with arbitrariness. As noted earlier, the 
jurisprudence surrounding equality law has evolved beyond a purely technical 
analysis, embracing an approach that considers not only the intent behind 
legislation or policy but also its real-world impact. We are of the opinion that 
the policies in question are a relevant example to show that merely likes being 
treated alike can lead to injustice. The pursuit of consistency through 
classification, while appealing in theory, does not ensure that the classification 
is either appropriate or equitable in practice. The substantive equality in 
contemporary equality jurisprudence calls not for a conceptually tidy “test”, but 
a multi-pronged approach to equality, which acknowledges the diverse ways 
 
72 NOIDA Entrepreneurs Association v. NOIDA and Others, (2011) 6 SCC 508.  

 
C.A. Nos. 3791-3793 of 2011 & Ors. 
 
Page 61 of 64 
 
in which inequality and discrimination may be perpetuated.73 To test the facts 
against the standards of substantive equality, we are of the opinion that Judges 
of the Supreme Court and the High Court, MPs, MLAs, officers of the AIS, 
journalists etc. cannot be treated as a separate category for allotment of land 
at a discounted basic value in preference to others. The object of the policy 
perpetuates inequality. The policy differentiates and bestows largesse to an 
advantaged section/group by resorting to discrimination and denial. It bars the 
more deserving, as well as those similarly situated, from access to the land at 
the same price. It promotes social-economic exclusion, to favour a small and 
privileged section/group. The policy does not meet the equality and fairness 
standards prescribed by the Constitution.  
 
88. 
Of course, the State has the discretion and duty under the Constitution, to 
distribute its resources to marginalised sections of society, or other imminent 
and deserving personalities, to the extent necessary to discharge their public 
functions. Personalities who contribute to the nation’s progress through 
excellence in sports or other public activities may also be compensated 
through reasonable and non-arbitrary distribution of State largesse. We would 
also like to clarify that a policy or law allotting land to public servants may be 
justifiable provided such allotment is within the confines of Article 14. Unless 
the classification satisfies the twin prong test and the substantive equality 
benchmark, the mandate of Article 14 is not met. The State cannot exercise 
discretion to benefit a select few elites disproportionately, especially ones who 
are already enjoying pre-existing benefits and advantages.  
 
 
73 The impugned policies are not in furtherance of anti-subordination principle, and they do not raise a 
presumption of constitutionality.

Reliance placed by some of the Cooperative Societies and members on the 
Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Land Revenue Act, 1317F, and the 1975 
Rules, including Section 25,74 is misconceived. Section 25 states that the land 
can be assigned for special purposes and such assignment shall be lawful. 
However, it does not mean that the land can be allotted in violation of principle 
of equality enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. 
 
90. 
Further, Rule 2(b) of the 1975 Rules states that alienation of land means 
placing land at the disposal of a third person for a public purpose or a specified 
cause. Alienation of land revenue, as defined in Section 2(c), means the grant 
of exemption from payment. Section 2(i) defines market value to mean value 
of the land that would fetch in the open market if sold, subject to appropriate 
charge for land revenue. Rule 10, which is relied upon by the Cooperative 
Societies and its members, states that notwithstanding anything contained in 
the rules, the Government, if it so desires, can sell or otherwise alienate the 
land or other property in Telangana area by following reasonable procedure, 
including public auction where alienation is deemed necessary. This rule does 
not support or assist the Cooperative Societies and their members in their 
argument. 
 
91. 
At this juncture, it is worth noting that during the pendency of the Writ Petition 
before the High Court, several members of the Judiciary, to their credit, 
decided to withdraw their applications for allotment of land.  Recognizing the 
 
74 25. Assigning of land for special purpose to be lawful – When a village is under settlement, the 
Commissioner of Survey Settlement or the Commissioner of Land Records in that Village and in other 
cases with the sanction of the Board of Revenue, the Collector may, subject to the orders of the 
Government, set apart any Khalsa land not in the lawful occupation of any person or class for pasturage 
of cattle or for grass reserves or for other Government purposes or for the purposes of public benefit; 
provided that it does not interfere with any right of any person or class. The land so set apart shall not 
be otherwise appropriated without the order of the Board of Revenue.

constitutional limitations and acknowledging that such allotment would violate 
Article 14, they made this decision upon thoughtful consideration. However, 
many others continued to defend the allotment, vigorously presenting 
arguments that they constituted a separate class with a rational nexus to the 
policy. These arguments, however, are devoid of merit and must be 
unequivocally rejected. 
 
CONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS 
92. 
In view of the aforesaid findings and discussion, we dismiss the appeals 
preferred by the State of Telangana, the Cooperative Societies and their 
members, and we allow the appeal preferred by Mr. Keshav Rao Jadhav 
challenging the judgment dated 05.01.2010 passed by the Division Bench of 
the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in Writ Petition Nos. 7956, 7997 and 23862 
of 2008. The said Writ Petitions are allowed, thereby issuing a Writ of certiorari 
and quashing GoM Nos. 243 and 244 dated 28.02.2005 to the extent they 
classify MPs, MLAs, officers of the AIS/State Government, Judges of the 
Constitutional Courts, and journalists as a separate class for allotment of land 
at the basic rate. As a sequitur, GoM Nos. 419, 420, 422 to 425 dated 
25.03.2008, and GoM No. 551 dated 27.03.2008, are declared to be bad in 
law, being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, and are quashed 
by issuing a Writ of certiorari. 
 
93. 
The interim directions passed by this Court in some of these cases will now 
stand merged with the final direction. Parties will be accordingly bound by the 
same.

We also deem it appropriate to pass an order of restitution and direct that the 
Cooperative Societies and their members, as the case may be, will be entitled 
to a refund of the entire amount deposited by them, including the stamp duty 
and the registration fee paid by them, along with the interest which may be 
quantified by the State of Telangana. The rate of interest will not exceed the 
Reserve Bank of India’s rate of interest applicable from time to time, as may 
be deemed fit by the State of Telangana. The lease deeds executed by the 
State of Telangana in favour of the societies/members will be treated as 
cancelled. Similarly, development charges/expenses paid by the Cooperative 
Societies/members, as reflected in the books of accounts of the Cooperative 
Societies /members, duly certified by the income-tax returns, will be refunded 
to them along with interest at the rates specified. 
 
95. 
It will be open to the State of Telangana to deal with the land in the manner it 
deems fit and proper and as per law, keeping in mind the observations and 
findings recorded in this judgment. 
 
96. 
The appeals and the contempt petitions are accordingly disposed of. All 
pending applications also stand disposed of.
