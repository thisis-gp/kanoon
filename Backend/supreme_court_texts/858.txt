The concept of just compensation rests on the principle of restitutio ad 
integrum which means restoration to the original condition, as far as possible, 
taking the person to whom damages are awarded, to a position as if the incident 
or in this case, the accident, had never occurred. While this is a well-recognized 
and positive principle of law, we must also recognize its limitations. The award 
of compensation, however much it may be, does not give back to the person who 
affected their life but only alleviates the worry of being able to secure the required 
amenities.

3. 
In awarding non-pecuniary damages, this Court has often highlighted the 
difficulty in computation, for there is no manner in which such determination 
lends itself to formulaic ciphering. Every person in life has undertaken certain 
steps towards the realization of dreams, held goals and aspirations, and when they 
land up in such an unfortunate situation, where, for no fault of theirs, the 
trajectories of their lives are forever altered. Although, abstract in the written 
word, these factors form a large part of the ‘pain and suffering’ one undergoes 
apart from the manifested disability, which may be visible to another person.  
4. 
This appeal arises from the final judgment and order dated 12th November 
2020 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in M.F.A.No.2573 of 
2016 (MV). This Miscellaneous First Appeal, in turn, was filed against the Award 
dated 17th April 2015 passed in M.V.C. No.3955 of 2009 by the Court of IX 
Additional Senior Civil Judge, Small Causes Court, at Bangalore.1 
5. 
 Certain past events require recall for adjudication of the present dispute.   
5.1 
On 22nd August 2008, the appellant was travelling in his Company 
vehicle, bearing registration No. KA-02-D-9626, towards his place of 
employment, situated at Kasaba Industrial Area, Hoskote. On the way, the 
vehicle collided with a container lorry bearing registration No.TN-04-D-
1047, which was allegedly being driven rashly and negligently.   
 
 
1 hereinafter referred to as ‘Tribunal’ 

 
3| SLP (C) NO. 18337 OF 2021 
 
5.2 
The injuries sustained were to the extent of 90% permanent 
disability (as per the case put forward by the claimant-appellant before the 
Tribunal), i.e.,  
 “1.  Fracture co-vertebra with anterior dislocation over C7 
                                      2.  Cervical Spine revealed dislocation of C-6 over C-7.    
                                    C-7 Bilateral transverse process fracture and 
   3.  C-6 fracture both laminae and body.” 
 
5.3 
The Hoskote Police have registered a case bearing Crime No.414 of 
2008 for the offences punishable under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of the 
Indian Penal Code, 18602, against the driver of the lorry.    
5.4 
It was contended before the Tribunal that the claimant-appellant was 
employed as a workman in L.M. Glassfibre (India) Pvt. Ltd., Hoskote, 
earning a gross salary of Rs.28,221/- per month. Apart from being so 
employed, he was also an agent with the Life Insurance Corporation of India 
earning an annual commission between Rs.30,000/- to Rs.40,000/- per 
annum.   
5.5 
Having heard arguments, the Tribunal framed two issues, one 
relating to rash and negligent driving of the lorry and the second regarding 
the quantum of compensation and by whom it will be payable.   
5.6 
The Tribunal3 concluded that the lorry was indeed being driven 
rashly and negligently and qua compensation it was held that respondent 
 
2 IPC for short 
3 It is to be noted that this determination of compensation was made after the High Court remitted the matter vide 
order dated 12th August 2014 for consideration afresh, on appeal from award dated 10th February 2011 passed by 
the IXth Additional Senior Civil Judge, member, MACT-7, Court of Small Causes, Bangalore 

 
4| SLP (C) NO. 18337 OF 2021 
 
No.2 therein (New India Assurance Company Limited) would be liable to 
pay a sum of Rs.58,09,930/- with 6% interest per annum on the above said 
sum (excluding future medical expenses of Rs.1,00,000/-) from the date of 
Petition till payment.   
6. 
Aggrieved by the order, both, the Insurance Company and the claimant-
appellant, approached the High Court.   
6.1 
The Court held that the Tribunal had rightly taken functional 
disability to be 100% and was correct in not deducting compensation of 
Rs.6,61,371/- paid by his employer to the claimant-appellant.   
6.2 
On the aspect of loss of future income, it was held that the claimant-
appellant, since he was below the age of 40, was entitled to 40% under this 
head. The amount was calculated to be Rs.70,22,520/-. In conclusion, 
considering other heads as well, the amount of compensation arrived at was 
a total of Rs.78,16,390/- as opposed to Rs.58,09,930/- awarded by the 
Tribunal.   
6.3 
The Insurance Company was directed to deposit the amount within 
four weeks, excluding interest, for the compensation awarded under the 
heading future medical expenses. The interest rate was maintained at 6%.   
7. 
Further, aggrieved by the final judgment and order of the High Court, the 
claimant-appellant is before us.   

 
5| SLP (C) NO. 18337 OF 2021 
 
8. 
During the course of arguments, it was submitted by the learned counsel 
for the claimant-appellant, that :- 
(i) 
 The High Court erred in taking future prospects at @ 40% instead 
of 50% in accordance with National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pranay 
Sethi4; 
(ii) 
Under the head ‘pain and suffering’, the compensation awarded by 
the High Court is insufficient given the 100% functional disability. 
In arguing that the compensation should be increased to 
Rs.10,00,000/-, reliance is placed on a judgment of this Court in 
Benson George v. Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. & Anr.5, 
and, in particular, para 20 thereof, wherein it was held that in the 
attending facts and circumstances, considering the multiple brain 
injuries/injuries sustained by the claimant because of which he was 
comatose and bedridden, Rs.10,00,000/- was awarded as enhanced 
compensation, observing the same to be reasonable; 
(iii) The Tribunal awarded Rs.1,00,000/- in terms of future medical 
expenses, which the High Court maintained without any discussion. 
Under this head too, it was submitted that the compensation should 
be enhanced to Rs.10,00,000/- in view of Parminder Singh v. New 
 
4 (2017) 16 SCC 680 
5 (2022) 13 SCC 142 

 
6| SLP (C) NO. 18337 OF 2021 
 
India Assurance Co. Ltd 6; and Lalan D. v. Oriental Insurance Co. 
Ltd.7. 
9. 
The age of the claimant-appellant at the time of the accident was 37 years8. 
The computation of future prospects is to be done as per the law laid down by a 
Constitution Bench of this Court in Pranay Sethi (supra) para 59.3, which 
records the conclusion in this regard, reads as under :- 
 
“59.3 While determining income, an addition of 50% of 
actual salary to the income of the deceased towards future 
prospects, where the deceased had a permanent job and was 
below the age of 40 years should be made. The addition 
should be 30%, if the age of the deceased was between 40 
to 50 years. In case the deceased was between the age of 50 
to 60 years, the addition should be 15%. Actual salary 
should read as actual salary less tax.” 
 
 
10. 
It is submitted that the claimant-appellant's employment was permanent in 
nature, and as such, the loss of future income ought to be calculated, in terms of 
the above, at 50%. The High Court, in para 23 of the judgment, observes that the 
total income of the claimant-appellant was Rs.27,867/- per month. 50% thereof 
is Rs.13,933/-. His income, therefore, comes to Rs.41,800/- (27,867 + 13,933). 
Considering the above-computed income, the compensation under the head loss 
of future prospects would be Rs.41,800 x 12 x 15 x 100% = Rs.75,24,000/- as 
opposed to Rs.70,22,520/- as calculated by the High Court.  
          The total compensation as it stands at the moment would be Rs. 80,67,870/- 
+ Rs.6,61,371/- = Rs.87,29,241/-.

11. 
 Let us now consider the claimant-appellant’s prayer for enhancement of 
compensation under the head ‘pain and suffering’. It cannot be disputed that the 
injuries sustained by the claimant-appellant are serious, and their effects on his 
life are long-lasting; one may even say lifelong. The examination of the doctor, 
namely, Dr. N.C. Prakash, forming part of record as Annexure P-5, dated 6th 
October 2010 reads as under: 
“5. I further state that recently I examined the patient on 30-
9-2010 for assessment of disability. He complains of the 
following:  
a. 
No sensation to below the C-7 Dermatome.  
b. 
Lost sensation of bowel and urinary system. 
c. 
No control below the neck. 
d. 
Needs assistance for every activity. 
 
6. On examination I found the following: 
 
At present he is in wheel chair bound with no movements 
(Grade 0/5) in both lower limbs, minimal movements in 
bilateral upper limb proximally with wrist being very weak 
(1/5 power) and grip is not possible. He has no urinary 
control, has no sensation of bowels and is on urinary 
catheter. He needs help for all his day to day activities. He 
was an Assistant Team Leader in LM Glass Fibers India Pvt. 
Ltd. and now can’t do any work. He has almost no chance 
of further improvement and impairment is likely to be 
permanent. All put together he has a disability of about 85% 
to the whole body.” 
 
 
12. 
It is to be noted that both the Tribunal and the High Court have taken the 
disability suffered by the claimant-appellant to be at 100%. We find no ground to 
take a different view.  
13. 
While acknowledging that ‘pain and suffering’, as a concept escapes 
definition, we may only refer to certain authorities, scholarly as also judicial 
wherein attempts have been made to set down the contours thereof. 

 
8| SLP (C) NO. 18337 OF 2021 
 
13.1 
The entry recording the term ‘pain and suffering’ in P. Ramanatha 
Iyer’s Advanced Law Lexicon9 reads as under:- 
“Pain and suffering. The term ‘Pain and suffering’ mean 
physical discomfort and distress and include mental and 
emotional trauma for which damages can be recovered in 
an accident claim. 
This expression has become almost a term of art, used 
without making fine distinction between pain and suffering. 
Pain and suffering which a person undergoes cannot be 
measured in terms of money by any mathematical 
calculation. Hence the Court awards a sum which is in the 
nature of a conventional award [Mediana, The (1900) AC 
113, 116]" 
 
13.2 
Eric Cassell10, an American Physician and Bioethicist, defines ‘pain’ 
not only as a sensation but also ‘as experience embedded in beliefs about 
causes and diseases and their consequences’, and ‘suffering’ as ‘the state of 
severe distress associated with events that threaten the intactness of person’. 
13.3 In a recent article11 published in the journal of the International 
Association for the Study of Pain, it has been recorded that there is no 
consensus on what exactly the concept of pain-related suffering includes, and 
it is often not precisely operationalised in empirical studies. The authors in 
their systematic review analysed 111 articles across a variety of disciplines 
such as bioethics, medical ethics, psycho-oncology, anaesthesiology, 
philosophy, sociology etc., we may refer to few of them:

13.3.1 
Eugene V. Boisaubin12, who is currently a Professor at the 
University of Texas, at Houston, in a 1989 article defined it as 
“Suffering is experienced by individual and arises from threats to the 
integrity of the individual as a complex social and psychological 
entity.”  
13.3.2 
Andrew Edgar, who is currently a Reader Emeritus in 
Philosophy at Cardiff University at UK has defined, in a 2007 article 
suffering as an “experience of life never getting better, revealing in the 
sufferer only vulnerability, futility, and impotence.” 
13.3.3 
Arthur W. Frank13, Professor Emeritus, Department of 
Sociology, University of Calgary in his well-known article “Can We 
Research Suffering?”, published in 2001, observed that "at the core of 
suffering is the sense that something is irreparably wrong with our lives, 
and wrong is the negation of what could have been right. Suffering 
resists definition because it is the reality of what is not."  
13.3.4 
Daryl Pullman14 who currently serves as University research 
Professor, Bioethics at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, 
Canada in his 2002 article defined suffering as the “product of

[physical], psychological, economic, or other factors that frustrate an 
individual in the pursuit of significant life projects.” 
13.4 
The Judicial Studies Board, now known as the Judicial College in the 
United Kingdom, produced guidelines in 1992 to produce greater 
consistency of awards and make the judicial scale of values more easily 
accessible. They have been deduced from a study of past cases, examining 
the range of awards therein. The latest edition of these guidelines was 
published in 202115. They record the difficulty of computing ‘pain and 
suffering’ as under :- 
"It is widely accepted that making of an award of general 
damages for pain and suffering is a somewhat artificial task. 
It involves the Judge seeking to convert the pain and 
suffering of a given claimant into a monetary award which 
he or she considers to be reasonable by way of 
compensation. That is a difficult task and one which has 
historically led to judges making widely varying awards of 
damages in respect of relatively comparable injuries a result 
which not only offends the principle of equality before law 
but results in unnecessary appeals and the incurring of 
additional cost, apart altogether from the burden that such 
appeals place on the Court’s own scarce resources.” 
   
13.5 
In determining non-pecuniary damages, the artificial nature of 
computing compensation has been highlighted in Heil v. Rankin16, as 
referred to in Attorney General of St. Helena v. AB & Ors.17 as under:- 
 
15 See : Hassam and Anr. v. Rabot and Anr. (2024) UKSC 11 
16 [2001] QB 272 
17 Privy Council Appeal No. 0034 of 2018. 
 
 
 
 

 
11| SLP (C) NO. 18337 OF 2021 
 
“23. This principle of ‘full compensation’ applies to 
pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage alike. But, as 
Dickson J indicated in the passage cited from his judgment 
in Andrews v Grand & Toy Alberta Ltd, 83 DLR (3d) 452, 
475-476, this statement immediately raises a problem in a 
situation where what is in issue is what the appropriate level 
of ‘full compensation’ for non-pecuniary injury is when the 
compensation has to be expressed in pecuniary terms. There 
is no simple formula for converting the pain and suffering, 
the loss of function, the loss of amenity and disability which 
an injured person has sustained, into monetary terms. Any 
process of conversion must be essentially artificial. Lord 
Pearce expressed it well in H West & Son Ltd v Shephard 
[1964] AC 326, 364 when he said: 
‘The court has to perform the difficult and artificial task of 
converting into monetary damages the physical injury and 
deprivation and pain and to give judgment for what it 
considers to be a reasonable sum. It does not look beyond 
the judgment to the spending of the damages.’ 
24. The last part of this statement is undoubtedly right. The 
injured person may not even be in a position to enjoy the 
damages he receives because of the injury which he has 
sustained. Lord Clyde recognised this in Wells v Wells 
[1999] 1 AC 345, 394H when he said: ‘One clear principle 
is that what the successful plaintiff will in the event actually 
do with the award is irrelevant.” 
 
13.6 
In the context of the United States, the most important piece of legal 
literature regarding ‘pain and suffering’ is an article titled Valuing Life and 
Limb in Tort: Scheduling Pain and Suffering, published in the year 1989.    
Relevant extracts thereof read as under : 
 
"Pain and suffering and other intangible or non-economic 
losses are even more problematic. Physical pain and 
attendant suffering have for centuries being recognised as 
legitimate elements of damages, and "modern" tort law has 
seen a marked expansion of the rights to recover for forms 
of mental anguish. Some Courts have even permitted 
recovery for emotional trauma unaccompanied by physical 
injury, including derivative losses stemming from injuries 
to family members. The precise elements of compensable 
non-economic loss vary by jurisdiction. Pain and suffering 
may be used as a catch-all category for the jury’s 
consideration of all non-pecuniary losses in a case of a non-
fatal injury, subsuming other qualitative categories such as 

 
12| SLP (C) NO. 18337 OF 2021 
 
mental anguish and humiliation. More commonly, though, 
other non-economic elements – such as “loss of enjoyment 
of life” are accorded independent standing …” 
 
Another important observation is that:  
 
“Whatever the categories of non-economic damages 
allowed in a given jurisdiction, the law provides no 
objective benchmarks valuing them. As one commentator 
notes, “Courts have usually been content to say that pain 
and 
suffering 
damages 
should 
amount 
to 
‘fair 
compensation’, or a ‘reasonable amount’, ‘without any 
definite guide’.”    
 
 
13.7 
Consideration of the above, underlines that while each discipline has 
its own conception of the meaning of pain/suffering, within its confines, the 
commonality that emerges is that a person's understanding of oneself is 
shaken or compromised at its very root at the hands of consistent suffering. 
In the present facts, it is unquestionable that the sense of something being 
irreparably wrong in life, as spoken by Frank (supra); vulnerability and 
futility, as spoken by Edgar, is present and such a feeling will be present for 
the remainder of his natural life.   
 
14. 
In respect of ‘pain and suffering’ in cases where disability suffered is at 
100%, we may notice a few decisions of this Court:- 
 
14.1  In R.D Hattangadi v. Pest Control (India) (P) Ltd.18.  It was 
observed : 
“17. The claim under Sl. No. 16 for ‘pain and suffering’ and 
for loss of amenities of life under Sl. No. 17, are claims for 
non-pecuniary loss. The appellant has claimed lump sum 
amount of Rs.3,00,000 each under the two heads. The High 
Court has allowed Rs.1,00,000 against the claims of 
Rs.6,00,000. When compensation is to be awarded for ‘pain 
and suffering’ and loss of amenity of life, the special 
 
18 (1995) 1 SCC 551  

 
13| SLP (C) NO. 18337 OF 2021 
 
circumstances of the claimant have to be taken into account 
including his age, the unusual deprivation he has suffered, 
the effect thereof on his future life. The amount of 
compensation for non-pecuniary loss is not easy to 
determine but the award must reflect that different 
circumstances have been taken into consideration. 
According to us, as the appellant was an advocate having 
good practice in different courts and as because of the 
accident he has been crippled and can move only on 
wheelchair, the High Court should have allowed an amount 
of Rs.1,50,000 in respect of claim for ‘pain and suffering’ 
and Rs.1,50,000 in respect of loss of amenities of life. We 
direct payment of Rs.3,00,000 (Rupees three lakhs only) against 
the claim of Rs.6,00,000 under the heads “‘pain and suffering’” 
and “Loss of amenities of life”. 
 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
 
 
14.2 
This Judgment was recently referred to by this Court in Sidram v. 
United India Insurance Company Ltd.19 reference was also made to 
Karnataka SRTC v. Mahadeva Shetty20 (irrespective of the percentage of 
disability incurred, the observations are instructive), wherein it was    
observed : 
“18. A person not only suffers injuries on account of 
accident but also suffers in mind and body on account of the 
accident through out his life and a feeling is developed that 
his no more a normal man and cannot enjoy the amenities 
of life as another normal person can. While fixing 
compensation for pain and suffering as also for loss of 
amenities, features like his age, marital status and unusual 
deprivation he has undertaken in his life have to be 
reckoned.” 
 
  
14.3  
In Kajal v. Jagdish Chand21 considering the facts of the case, i.e., 
100% disability, child being bedridden for life, her mental age being that of 
a nine-month-old for life - a vegetative existence, held that “even after taking 
 
19 (2023) 3 SCC 439 
20 (2003) 7 SCC 197 
21 (2020) 4 SCC 413 

 
14| SLP (C) NO. 18337 OF 2021 
 
a conservative view of the matter an amount payable for the ‘pain and 
suffering’ of this child should be at least Rs.15,00,000/-.”  
 
14.4  
In Ayush v. Reliance General Insurance22 relying on Kajal (supra) 
the amount awarded in ‘pain and suffering’ was enhanced to Rs.10,00,000. 
The child who had suffered the accident was five years old and the Court 
noted in paragraph 2 that : 
“As per the discharge certificate, the appellant is not able to 
move both his legs and had complete sensory loss in the 
legs, urinary incontinence, bowel constipation and bed 
sores. The appellant was aged about 5 years as on the date 
of the accident, hence has lost his childhood and is 
dependent on others for his routine work.” 
 
 
 
14.5  
In Lalan (supra) cited by the claimant-appellant, the Tribunal 
awarded Rs.30,000/- which was enhanced to Rs.40,000/- by the High Court. 
Considering the fact that the appellant therein has suffered extensive brain 
injury awarded compensation under ‘pain and suffering’ to the tune of 
Rs.3,00,000/-. 
15.  
Keeping in view the above-referred judgments, the injuries suffered, the 
‘pain and suffering’ caused, and the life-long nature of the disability afflicted upon 
the claimant-appellant, and the statement of the Doctor as reproduced above, we 
find the request of the claimant-appellant to be justified and as such, award      
Rs.15,00,000/- under the head ‘pain and suffering’,  fully conscious of the fact 
that the prayer of the claimant–appellant for enhancement of compensation was 
 
22 (2022) 7 SCC 738 

 
15| SLP (C) NO. 18337 OF 2021 
 
by a sum of Rs. 10,00,000/-, we find the compensation to be just, fair and 
reasonable at the amount so awarded. 
16.  
It stands clarified that we have modified the Award, as given by the High 
Court, only on two counts, i.e., future prospects and ‘pain and suffering’. The 
amount as enhanced, shall carry interest @ 6%, from the date of filing of the 
petition for special leave to appeal. According to paragraph 10, the compensation 
to be awarded stood at Rs.87,29,241/-. Consequent to the above discussion on 
‘pain and suffering’, the total amount now payable is Rs.1,02,29,241/-. 
17.  
The appeal is allowed as aforesaid. Pending applications, if any, stand 
disposed of.  
18. 
No costs.
