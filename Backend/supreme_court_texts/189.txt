JUDGMENT

1. 
Leave granted. 
2. 
Matter was called twice but no one appeared on behalf of the 
respondents. 
3. 
The instant appeal has been filed by the appellant being 
aggrieved by the order dated 3rd July, 2019 passed in Writ-C No. 
15225 of 2019, by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad 
whereby the writ petition preferred by the respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 
3 herein was allowed and the resolution/proposal dated 2nd 
September, 2018 issued by the Land Management Committee and 
Digitally signed by

its approval dated 17th September, 2018 by the State authorities 
was quashed. 
4. 
Brief facts relevant and essential for disposal of the instant 
appeal are that a primary school situated in the village Mai 
Kharagpur, tehsil Lalganj, district Azamgarh was found to be 
falling on the proposed alignment of the National Highway and 
accordingly, the same was demolished by the National Highways 
Authority of India (for short ‘NHAI’) for the purposes of 
construction of the highway. 
5. 
The villagers requested the NHAI to construct new primary 
school in the village which was accepted by the NHAI.  The Land 
Management Committee issued a proposal identifying and 
providing a plot of land in the village for the construction of the 
new primary school and forwarded the same for approval to the 
State authorities vide communication dated 2nd September, 2018.  
The proposal was accepted by the Sub-Divisional Officer, 
Lalganj(for short ‘SDO’) vide order dated 17th September, 2018 and 
NHAI started construction of the school.   
6. 
In order to challenge the said proposal, respondent Nos. 1 
and 2 herein i.e. Avinash and Ram Jee filed a writ petition in the 
Allahabad High Court styling it to be a Public Interest Litigation 

 
3 
 
being PIL No. 4648 of 2018.  It is relevant to mention here that in 
this PIL, no such assertion was made that the plot of land in 
question had ever been allotted to the private respondents being 
the writ petitioners in the PIL.  The said PIL came to be dismissed 
by the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court vide order dated 
27th October, 2018 observing that whatever steps had been taken 
by the authorities being the members of the Gram Sabha, the 
objection thereto by the respondents was nothing but an attempt 
to interfere in public work. It was also held that no public interest 
was involved in the petition.   
7. 
The respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 herein did not rest satisfied 
with the rejection of their PIL and preferred Writ-C No. 10806 of 
2019 challenging the proposal dated 2nd September, 2018 praying 
to restrain the NHAI authorities from constructing the primary 
school on the Plot No. 821M in village Mai Kharagpur. 
8. 
Writ-C No. 10806 of 2019 preferred by the respondent Nos. 
1, 2 and 3 was held to be not maintainable and came to be 
dismissed by the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court vide 
order dated 18th April, 2019 observing that since the dispute 
related to landed property, it could not be adjudicated upon by 
High Court in exercise of powers conferred under Article 226 of the 

 
4 
 
Constitution of India and liberty was granted to the writ 
petitioners(respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 herein) to avail  appropriate 
relief by filing a civil suit before the Civil Court in accordance with 
law. 
9. 
Concealing the factum of filing the aforesaid two writ 
petitions, the respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3 herein, preferred yet 
another writ petition being Writ-C No. 15225 of 2019 in the 
Allahabad High Court assailing the validity and legality of the 
resolution/proposal dated 2nd September, 2018 of the Land 
Management Committee and its approval by SDO vide order dated 
17th September, 2018.   
10. It may be mentioned that a pertinent declaration was made 
by the respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 herein, the original writ 
petitioners in Writ-C No. 15525 of 2019 that the petition which 
they had filed in the High Court, was the first writ petition of its 
kind.   
11. The High Court seems to have proceeded in hot haste and 
immediately on the first listing of the writ petition, the standing 
counsel for State of U.P. was summoned and directed to obtain 
instructions.  The matter was posted to the very next day i.e. 3rd 
July, 2019  and without issuing notice to the other respondents 

 
5 
 
including the appellant herein, who was an impleaded respondent 
in the writ petition, and merely taking note of the oral submissions 
of the standing counsel, the writ petition was allowed by order 
dated 3rd July, 2019 holding that disputed plot No.821M vested in 
the allotees(original writ petitioners being respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 
3 herein) and the Land Management Committee or SDO had no 
right to reserve this land for construction of a primary school.  The 
resolution dated 2nd September, 2018 and the approval by the SDO 
dated 17th September, 2018 were declared to be illegal and were 
set aside. 
12. The respondent before the High Court is in appeal before this 
Court seeking to assail the order dated 3rd July, 2019. 
13. A stay was granted by this Court on the operation of the 
impugned order.  Counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the 
private respondents (respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 being original writ 
petitioners) and the same is taken on record. However, when the 
matter was taken up for hearing, no one appeared to contest the 
matter on behalf of these respondents. 
14. Learned counsel representing the appellant made an 
emphatic statement that the school in question has already been 
constructed and is operational on the disputed plot of land which 

 
6 
 
was a government land.  He urged that factum of filing of two 
earlier writ petitions with similar prayers was concealed by 
respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 herein, while filing writ petition being 
Writ-C No. 15225 of 2019.  Furthermore, the appellant being the 
impleaded respondent in the writ petition, was never heard by the 
High Court because the writ petition was allowed without issuing 
any formal notice. 
15. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the 
submissions made at bar and have gone through the material 
available on record. 
16. On a perusal of the admitted facts as emanating from record, 
we are persuaded to hold that the impugned order passed by the 
High Court smacks of arbitrariness and perversity.  The writ 
petition filed claiming title on the disputed plot of land was taken 
up in hot haste and was allowed without issuing formal notice to 
all the respondents.  Even the State authorities were not given 
proper opportunity of filing a counter. The standing counsel was 
instructed to appear without any formal notice being issued and 
was given a single day’s opportunity to present the factual report.  
Based on the factual report and noting the oral submissions of the 
standing counsel, the writ petition came to be allowed by the High 

 
7 
 
Court quashing the proposal dated 2nd September, 2018 and 
approval by SDO dated 17th September, 2018.  The manner in 
which the proceedings were undertaken indicates that the High 
Court was keen on not allowing the respondents therein to be 
heard in the writ proceedings. The original writ petitioners- 
respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 herein had apparently made false and 
misleading averments in the opening para of the Writ-C No.15225 
of 2019, that no previous writ petition had been filed craving 
similar relief. As a matter of fact, the writ petition deserved 
rejection with exemplary costs because as noted above, the factum 
of filing of the previous two writ petitions was concealed by the 
respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3-original writ petitioners. The writ 
petition was manifestly tainted on account of concealment of 
material facts. Even in the counter affidavit filed in the present 
case, the respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3-original writ petitioners have 
not disputed that the factum of filing of the previous two writ 
petitions not being disclosed while filing the Writ-C No. 15225 of 
2019. 
17. However, since no one has appeared to defend the matter on 
behalf of the respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3-original writ petitioners, 
we refrain from imposing cost in the matter.

18. In the wake of discussion made hereinabove, the impugned 
order dated 3rd July, 2019 passed by the learned Single Judge of  
High Court of Judicature at Allahabad is found to be suffering from 
patent illegality, perversity and having been passed in sheer 
violation of principles of natural justice and hence, the same is 
quashed and set aside. 
19. The appeal is accordingly allowed. 
20. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
