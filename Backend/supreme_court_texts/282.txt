 ANIRUDDHA BOSE, J.
The two appeals (i.e. Civil Appeal Nos.2745 and 2754  of
2023) arise out of a judgment delivered by a learned Single Judge
of the High Court of Bombay on 25.07.2019 directing, inter alia,
wage revisions pertaining to the workmen of VVF India Limited
(“the employer”) working in two units at Sewree and Sion. Civil
Appeal No.2744 of 2023 has been instituted by the employees

union  (“the  union”)  against  a  judgment  of  the  High  Court
delivered on 22.06.2021 dismissing the union’s petition for review
of the judgment passed on 25.07.2019.  Argument of the union
in  the  review  petition  was  that  their  submissions  relating  to
certain allowances were not considered in the main judgment.
The employer is the appellant in Civil Appeal No.2754 of 2023
and the union is the appellant in Civil Appeal No.2744 of 2023 as
also Civil Appeal No.2745 of 2023.  
2. The  present  proceedings  have  their  origin  in  a  charter  of
demand raised by the union on 04.03.2008. The demand was in
respect of altogether 146 workmen, out of which 80 were engaged
at  the  employer’s  establishment  at  Sewree  and  66  of  them
employed at Sion, both being situated within Mumbai.  We find
from  the  judgment  delivered  on  24.07.2019  (which  we  shall
henceforth  refer  to  as  the  judgment  under  appeal)  that  the
original corporate entity VVF Ltd., underwent a demerger process
and the units of the company at Sion and Taloja went to VVF
India  Ltd.,  the  resulting  company,  during  pendency  of  the
reference, arising from the charter of demand.

5.
Both the employer and the union challenged the said award
by instituting separate writ petitions before the High Court of
Bombay and these writ petitions were disposed of by a common
judgment by a learned Single Judge of the High Court, being the
judgment under appeal before us. The Union’s writ petition was
registered as Writ Petition No. 1920 of 2014 whereas the writ
petition of the company was registered as Writ Petition No.3152 of
2014. The High Court allowed the workmen’s writ petition by
setting aside the award of the Tribunal so far as the first four
demands  as  per  the  charter  are  concerned  and  upheld  the
Tribunal’s verdict regarding Demand No. 5-11. The particulars
thereof  would  appear  from  the  following  passages  of  the
judgment: -

The  following  adjustments  are  proposed  so  as  to
rationalize  the  transition  from  the  present  basic  wage
structure to the revised scale proposed as above:
A. The present basic of employees I staff as in annexure I
& II should brought up to the level of minimum of wage
scales wherever they are below.
B. Those whose present wages of basic do not fit in any
stages of their respective revised wage scales and fall in
between two stages, they should be stepped up to earnest
highest stages in the scales.
C. On doing so (a) and (b) above every employee / staff
should be granted additional increment in their respective
wage scales as indicated below:-
i) Those who have put service up to 5 years
increment
ii) Those who have put service more than 5

        -6”
“29.
To arrive  at  the  proposed revision, the  existing
fixed  dearness  allowance  of  Rs.225/-  for  daily  rated
unskilled (USK), Semi skilled (SSK) and skilled workmen
(SK)  as also monthly rated Highly Skilled workmen (HSK),
1st class boiler attendants, watchmen, head watchman,
drivers, peons (i.e. all employees other than supervisors
and officers) can be appropriately raised by Rs.1000/- per
month  so  as  to  make  it  Rs.1225/-  per  month.  Fixed
dearness allowance for monthly rated junior supervisors,
supervisors and senior supervisors and officers may not be
increased.  So  far  as  variable  dearness  allowance  is
concerned, no increase may be in order till 2011. Increase,
if  any,  deserves  to  be  considered  from  2011  onwards,
which  demand,  anyway,  is  the  subject  matter  of  a
separate reference (for the period 2011-2014).”
So far as the employer’s writ petition is concerned the same was
dismissed.  The  High  Court  held  that  there  was  no  serious
anomaly in the demands of the union allowed by the Tribunal. 
6.
The union, in its writ petition, argued that the Tribunal had
failed  to  consider  the  plea  of  the  workmen  for  parity  with
similarly situated units in the vicinity as well as its claim for
overtime  allowances.  The  test  applied  by  the  High  Court  as
regards comparison with the similar units would appear from
paragraph 26 of the impugned judgment, which reads:-
9

“26 In Justification, what was submitted was that this,
along with the applicable allowances (as revised), would
bring the Mumbai workmen on par with their counterparts
in the Taloja unit. To assess this submission, I called upon
both parties to submit their respective charts of Mumbai
and  Taloja  salaries  for  all  classes  of  workers  and  the
impact of revision in pay scales proposed by the union.
According to the union, the revision proposed would bring
up the salaries of skilled grade workmen having 15 years
of service (taken as a representative case) to Rs.16,250/-
per month as against the salaries of Rs.16,248/- of their
Taloja  counterparts  (as  of  October  2010).  (Comparative
chart of Godrej Industries, Deepak Fertilizers and Hikal
Ltd. shows their comparable salaries, as of October 2010,
of Rs.28,621/-, Rs.20,492/- and Rs.21,419/- respectively.)
The  monthly  and  annual  burdens  on  the  Respondent
employer occasioned by the increase work out to between
Rs.6.58 lacs to Rs.14.01 lacs per month, and Rs.78.94
lacs  to  Rs.1.68  crores,  for  the  particular  wage  fixation
period, namely, from 2008 to 2011.”
7.
The employer has  assailed  the  judgment questioning  the
jurisdiction of the Writ Court in entering into fact-finding exercise
while testing legality of an award.  The employer’s case argued by
Mr. Cama, learned Senior Advocate, sought to fault the approach
of the High Court mainly on this ground. He has also argued that
the units with which the High Court had made comparison to
arrive at its finding were not similarly situated, having regard to
their  industrial  output  and  financial  position.   He  submits
further that the High Court in any event would not sit in appeal
over the Tribunal’s award in exercising its jurisdiction of judicial
review, primarily applying the scope of the writ of certiorari. He
10

has relied on judgments of this Court in the cases of Surya Dev
Rai  v.  Ram  Chander  Rai  and  Others [(2003)  6  SCC  675],
General  Management,  Electrical  Rengali  Hydro  Electric
Project, Orrisa and Others -vs- Giridhari Sahu and Others
[(2019) 10 SCC 695]. In the former judgment, it has been held:-
“12. In the exercise of certiorari jurisdiction, the High Court
proceeds  on  an  assumption  that  a  court  which  has
jurisdiction over a subject-matter has  the jurisdiction to
decide wrongly as well as rightly. The High Court would
not, therefore, for the purpose of certiorari assign to itself
the role of an appellate court and step into reappreciating
or evaluating the evidence and substitute its own findings
in place of those arrived at by the inferior court.”
Broadly the same principle has been laid down in the case of
Giridhari Sahu (supra). Mr. Cama has also submitted that in the
event the High Court found flaw in the reasoning of the Tribunal
on factual basis, instead of undertaking the exercise of revision of
pay scale and wages as also other facilities itself in substituting
its view in place of the Tribunal’s, the High Court ought to have
remanded the matter to the Tribunal itself.
8.
The union was represented by Mr. Sanjay Singhvi, learned
senior counsel. His submission is that it would be well within the
jurisdiction of the High Court to undertake some form of exercise
of appreciation of facts and on judgments he has relied on the
11

judgment  of  this  Court  in  the  cases  of  M/S  Unichem
Laboratories  Ltd. -vs- Workmen [(1972) 3 SCC 552], Workmen
-vs- New Egerton Woollen Mills [(1969) 2 LLJ 782], Shail (SMT)
-vs-  Manoj  Kumar  and  Others [(2004)  4  SCC  785],  IEL
Supervisors' Association and Others -vs- Duncans Industries
Ltd. and Another [(2018) 4 SCC 505]. 
9.
Relying on this line of authorities, and also a judgment of
this Court in the case of Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd. and Others
-vs- Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha and Others [(1980) 2
SCC 593], he has argued that the jurisdiction of the High Court
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is wide enough and
can decide factual issues instead of remanding a matter.  In the
latter authority, it was held, inter-alia, that in appropriate cases,
the High Court’s jurisdiction could be coordinate to that of the
Tribunal. 
10.
On behalf of both the parties, a large body of authorities has
been relied upon but in this judgment, we shall deal with those
decisions only which we find relevant for effective adjudication of
the present appeal. 
12

11.
As we have already indicated, the main question which has
been argued by the learned counsel appearing for the employer is
on the issue as to whether the High Court had travelled beyond
its  jurisdiction  in  appreciating  facts  and  in  that  process
substituted the finding of the Tribunal with its own finding on
facts. To substantiate the point, as we have already discussed,
the cases of Giridhari (supra) and Surya Dev Rai (supra) have
been relied on by Mr. Cama.
12.
There are authorities, to which we have referred to earlier in
this judgment that lay down the scope of jurisdiction of the High
Court. In the cases of Unichem Laboratories Ltd. (supra), Shail
(SMT) (supra), IEL Supervisors' Assn. (supra) as also the case of
Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd. (supra), it has been held that the High
Court in appropriate cases can go into facts while examining an
award of a Tribunal. 
13.
For  revision  of  wages  and  other  facilities,  the  standard
criteria which is followed by the industrial adjudicator is to apply
industry-cum-region test, which in substance implies that the
prevailing pay and other allowances should be compared with
equally placed or similarly situated industrial units in the same
13

region.  To  determine  comparability  of  units  applying  the
industry-cum-region test, inter alia, the financial capacity of the
employer would be a strong factor. Reliance on this point has
been placed on the cases of  French Motor Car Co. Ltd. -vs-
Workmen [(1962)  2  LLJ  744],  The  Silk  and  Art  Silk  Mills
Association Ltd. -vs- Mill Mazdoor Sabha [(1972) 2 SCC 253]
and Shivraj Fine Arts Litho Works -vs- State Industrial Court,
Nagpur & Ors. [(1978) 2 SCC 601].
14.
Substantial  argument  of  Mr.  Cama  was  on  selection  of
comparable  units.  His  submission  is  that  the  High  erred  in
identifying the matching units and also calling for fresh charts in
course of hearing of the writ petition with respect to Taloja unit of
the original employer. It is the stand of the employer that such
evidence gathering exercise ought not to have been undertaken
by  the  High  Court.  It was  also  pointed  out  on  behalf  of  the
employer that it was making losses barring in three financial
years between 2008-09 and 2021-22.  Further submission of Mr.
Cama is that the workmen of the Taloja unit were not of the same
employer after the demerger had taken place and that they were
14

involved in a separate set of activities when compared to the other
units in question.
15.
 Analysis of the authorities relied on by the learned counsel
for parties reflect the position of law on this point to be that,
though the High Court ought not to reappreciate evidence and
substitute its own finding for that of the Tribunal, it would not be
beyond the jurisdiction of the High Court in its power of judicial
review to altogether eschew such a process. The High Court, in
the impugned judgment, however, reappreciated the evidence led
before  the  Tribunal  in  identifying  comparable  concerns  for
applying  the  industry-cum-region  test.   In  particular,  the
employer  has  emphasised  that  the  High  Court  ignored  the
negative financial status of the company on the ground that the
losses made by it was miniscule. In this regard, the judgments of
this Court in the case of A.K. Bindal -vs- Union of India & Ors.
[(2003) 5 SCC 163] Mukand Ltd. -vs- Mukand Staff & Officers
Association [(2004) 10 SCC 460] have been relied upon. Both
these authorities lay down the financial capacity of an employer
is an important factor which could not be ignored in fixing wage
structure.  In  the  given  facts  where  the  employer  seriously
contested the use of the concerned units as comparable ones,
15

and highlighted its difficult financial position, the proper course
would have been to remit the matter to the Industrial Tribunal
rather than entering into these factual question independently in
exercise  of  the  writ  jurisdiction.  This  exercise  would  have
required  leading  of  evidence  before  the  primary  forum,  the
Industrial Tribunal in this case.
16.
On behalf of the employer, it was also specifically argued
that  various  allowances  like  house  rent,  shift  allowance,
travelling,  medical,  education  and  leave  travel  were  granted
without any evidence.  The employer’s witness no.2 had given his
deposition  in  detail,  particularly  on  financial  position  of  the
company.  From the judgment impugned, we do not find proper
analysis of the employer’s evidence in that regard. So far as the
union’s appeal is concerned, their point is confined to treatment
of overtime wages in computing allowances admissible to them.
That question also ought to be re-examined.
17.
We, accordingly, set aside the judgment of the High Court
delivered on 25.07.2019 as also the Tribunal’s award. Let the
Tribunal re-examine the cases of the respective parties afresh.
We are conscious of the fact that these proceedings arise from a
16

charter  of  demand  made  in  2008.  We  direct  the  Tribunal  to
conclude the reference within a period of six months.  The Civil
Appeal  No.2744  of  2023  against  the  review  order  dated
22.06.2021 also stands disposed of.  
18.
Thus, all the three appeals stand disposed of in the above
terms.
19.
There shall be no order as to costs.
20.
