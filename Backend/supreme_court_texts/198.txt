The present applications relate to mining activities being 
undertaken in Districts - Bellary, Chitradurga and Tumkur in 
Karnataka.  
In 2009, the petitioner - Samaj Parivartana Samudaya had filed 
a writ petition praying for this Court’s intervention on grounds of 
the illegality of such mining activities and consequent harm caused 
to the environment.  This Court intervened and has passed several 
directions and orders.  
To avoid prolixity, we will not be referring to the catena of 
orders passed by this Court in depth and detail. However, to 
appreciate the present applications, we have summarized the 
relevant developments below:

• The genesis of the Central Empowered Committee1  goes back 
to this Court’s order dated 09.09.2002 in “T.N. Godavarman 
Thirumalpad v. Union of India & Ors.”, where the Court was 
concerned with the rampant pilferage and illegal extraction 
of natural resources, particularly iron ore, and the 
environmental 
degradation 
and 
disaster 
that 
may 
have 
resulted from unchecked intrusion into the forest areas.  
• The CEC was constituted to monitor the situation, implement 
this Courts’ orders, and delineate the steps to be taken.  
• On 19.11.2010, the CEC was directed by this Court to submit 
a report with respect to certain mining leases granted by 
the State of Karnataka in District – Bellary.  
• The initial reports of CEC indicated large-scale illegal 
mining being undertaken.  
• On 06.05.2011, this Court constituted a ‘Joint Team’ to 
determine the boundaries of the specific mines since a large 
number of mining lessees were carrying out operations beyond 
the 
lease 
boundaries, 
thereby 
causing 
environmental 
degradation. 
• On 29.07.2011, this Court imposed a temporary ban on mining 
operations in District – Bellary.2  
• On 26.08.2011, this Court extended the temporary ban on 
mining operations to Districts – Chitradurga and Tumkur.3 
• On 05.08.2011 and 26.08.2011, this Court directed the Indian

• On 14.08.2011, ICFRE submitted its report wherein it inter 
alia 
recommended: 
(i) 
imposition 
of 
district-level 
production ceiling; and (ii) preparation of Reclamation and 
Rehabilitation Plans5 for each mining lease which apart from 
prescribing actions for reclamation and rehabilitation works 
would 
also 
prescribe 
a 
Maximum 
Permissible 
Annual 
Production6 restricting the total quantity of iron ore that 
could be produced at the specific mining lease.  
• Based on ICFRE report and CEC’s recommendations, this Court 
imposed differing production ceilings on mining leases in 
the three districts, which have been enhanced from time to 
time: 
o vide order dated 13.04.2012, production ceiling of 25 
Million Metric Tons7 was fixed on mines in the Bellary 
District and 5 MMT in Tumkur and Chitradurga Districts;  
o these caps were enhanced to 28 MMT for the Bellary 
District and 7 MMT for Tumkar and Chitradurga Districts 
vide order dated 14.12.2017; and 
o these caps were further enhanced to 35 MMT for Bellary 
District and 15 MMT for the Tumkar and Chitradurga

Districts vide order dated 26.08.2022.  
• Vide report dated 03.02.2012, the CEC recommended the 
categorization of the mines into Categories A, B and C based 
on the severity of encroachment by the mines and overburden 
dumps, determined in terms of the percentage in relation to 
the total lease area. In such categorization, Category A 
mining leases bear no/marginal illegality and Category C 
mining leases stand in flagrant violation of laws.   
• To strike a balance between environmental protection and 
development, a central public sector undertaking – National 
Minerals Development Corporation was allowed to operate two 
mining leases in District – Bellary.  
• Further, permission to sell old stock of iron ore by e-
auction was granted through a Monitoring Committee set up by 
this Court.   
• Vide report dated 13.03.2012, the CEC recommended the 
implementation of R&R Plans, as a precondition to resumption 
of mining operations.8 In due course of time, mining was 
permitted to resume in specific Category A and B mines based 
on the reports of the CEC and on judgments/orders of this 
Court.  
• Category C mining licenses were cancelled, and the proceeds 
from sale of iron ore from Category C mines were ordered to 
be forfeited to the State.  
• Some of the Category C mining leases have been auctioned and

have subsequently commenced production. The new leaseholders 
have undertaken to implement R&R Plans as a precondition to 
commence operations.

to 
facilitate 
ameliorative and mitigative measures around the mining 
leases in the three districts.  
• Vide order dated 21.04.2022, this Court constituted the 
Justice B. Sudarshan Reddy Committee as an Oversight 
Authority to oversee the work of the SPV.11  
• Vide order dated 28.09.2022, this Court directed the Joint 
Team to prepare sketches of 7 mining leases placed in 
Category B-1.   
 
The seven B-1 Category mining leases (listed below) lie 
between the States of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. They require 
demarcation on the ground.

This Court’s order dated 28.09.2022, directing the Joint Team 
to prepare sketches of these seven mining leases, was deferred till 
the inter-state boundary was demarcated on the ground.  
 
Vide letter dated 09.01.2023, the State of Karnataka informed 
the CEC that inter-state boundaries between the states of Karnataka 
and Andhra Pradesh had been fixed on the ground.  
 
However, it is apparent that further work must be undertaken 
at the ground level by deploying the total station survey method 
along with the satellite images of the mining sites.   
 
By letter dated 29.02.2024, the government of Andhra Pradesh, 
had stated it would be represented by the following four officers, 
as a part of the Joint Team which was directed to render support to 
the CEC in surveying the seven mining leases:-

We clarify that if there is a change of the aforesaid named 
officers of the States of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the 
replacement/designated officer would be co-opted in the Joint Team.  
 
The CEC has requested the National Institute of Technology, 
Suratkhal, Karnataka,12 to carry out the aforesaid survey at the 
ground level, based on the total station method and satellite 
images of the seven mining leases. The members of the ‘Joint Team’ 
will be associated and shall cooperate with representatives of NIT 
Karnataka.  
 
The survey will be undertaken for one mining lease at a time. 
 
12 For short, “NIT Karnataka”. 

8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The report will be submitted with the joint signatures of the 
‘Joint Team’ to the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. A copy 
thereof will be filed before this Court. The said exercise would be 
completed no later than six months from today.  
 
The CEC after receiving the survey/demarcation report will 
issue notice to the respective lessees and pass appropriate orders. 
This exercise will be undertaken even if the leases have expired in 
the due course of time. Orders passed by the CEC will be 
communicated to the parties, and a report will be filed before this 
Court within a period of seven months from today.  
 
The Monitoring Committee will also be associated with the 
aforesaid exercise undertaken by the CEC, post the submission of 
the survey/demarcation report(s).  
 
The State of Karnataka will be empowered and entitled to 
participate in the proceedings before the CEC and raise all 
objections and contentions. 
Re-list all pending applications in W.P.(C) no. 562/2009 and 
768/2013 on 03.04.2024.  
 
I.A. No. 225561 of 2023 
MPAP and District-Level Production Ceiling 
 
As noticed in the summary of developments above, this Court 
had fixed a district-level production ceiling for all mining leases 
in the Districts – Bellary, Tumkur and Chitradurga. These caps were 
enhanced from time to time. The final enhancement of production 
ceilings was done vide order dated 26.08.2022 whereby a production 
ceiling of 35 MMT for Bellary District and 15 MMT for the Tumkar 

9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and Chitradurga Districts was specified.  
The district-level production ceilings apply to Category A and 
Category B mining leases. Category ‘C’ mining leases were cancelled 
and were thereafter e-auctioned, and hence are under a different 
legal regime.  
 
Parallelly, in its report dated 13.03.2012, the CEC fixed the 
guidelines for the preparation and/or implementation of the R&R 
Plans as a pre-condition to the resumption of mining in the three 
districts. This was done given the devastation and degradation of 
the environment on account of unregulated and illegal mining 
activities. The objective of the R&R Plans is to:- 
 
(a) carry out the time-bound reclamation and rehabilitation of 
the areas found to be under illegal mining;  
 
(b) ensure scientific and environmentally sustainable mining;  
 
(c) ensure compliance with the various standards stipulated 
under the environment/mining statutes; and 
 
(d) regular and effective motoring, evaluation and corrective 
measures. 
 
As noticed above, the R&R Plans, together with specifying 
actions to be undertaken for reclamation and rehabilitation works, 
provided for an MPAP restriction for each mining lease. However, 
the upper cap fixed at the district level is mandatory and binding.  
This Court, vide judgment/order dated 14.12.2017, directed 
that a production cap of the individual mining leases will be 
regulated through the MPAP limits prescribed in the R&R Plans, 
without reference to the upper or general cap fixed at the district 
level.  

10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CEC states that the lease-wise R&R Plans have been 
prepared for all mining leases, which have been submitted by the 
Joint Team. It consists of two broad components: (a) R&R Plans for 
areas found to be under illegal mining by the Joint Team and (b) 
Supplementary 
Environment 
Management 
Plan. 
In 
addition, 
Comprehensive Environment Plans for the Mining Impact Zone13 for the 
areas surrounding the mining leases, would be prepared. 
 
Accordingly, the CEC and CEPMIZ had proposed, and it was 
accepted by this Court, that MPAP for each of the mining leases 
should 
be 
implemented 
and 
executed. 
This 
figure 
may 
be 
substantially lower than permissible limits specified under the 
Environment Clearance, Approved Mining Plan, and/or the Consent to 
Operate, granted for the respective mining leases. For the purpose 
of feasible annual production, the following factors would be kept 
in mind:-  
 
(a) mineral reserves in the lease area;  
 
(b) area available for overburden/waste dump(s) and subgrade 
dump(s); and  
 
(c) existing transport facilities vis-a-vis the traffic load 
of the mining lease and adjoining mining leases. 
The MPAP is the minimum of the quantity that may be feasible 
based on the above three parameters. Further, if the total of the 
lease-wise annual production from all the leases in the district 
exceeds the ceiling limit fixed for a specific district, then the 
MPAP for each mining lease was/is to be scaled down on a pro-rata 
basis, to ensure that the district-level production ceiling is not 
 
13 For short, “CEPMIZ”. 

11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
breached. 
 
The aforesaid parameters were accepted by this Court by the 
order dated 13.04.2012. We respectfully concur and state that these 
directions shall continue.  
 
Our attention has been drawn to the CEC report dated 
14.07.2017 and the orders passed by this Court on 14.12.2017 and 
26.08.2022.  
 
Keeping in view the aforesaid position, we would request the 
CEC, together with the Monitoring Committee and aid and advice of 
the Oversight Authority, to undertake a complete exercise in the 
three districts, and the respective mining leases situated therein, 
and submit a report before this Court. While undertaking the said 
exercise, they shall keep in mind the parameters referred to in the 
report dated 13.03.2012. The CEC will be entitled to take help and 
assistance of the scientific domain experts who will examine data, 
including environmental pollution data available/recorded in the 
districts from time to time.  
 
A copy of the said report will be filed before this Court 
within a period of four months from today. While submitting the 
report, it shall also be examined whether sub-caps in particular 
areas should be fixed or caps should be increased or decreased. In 
other words, the CEC will also examine whether a mining cap must be 
imposed in an area for better compliance and regulation.  
 
Further, the CEC, the Monitoring Committee and the Oversight 
Authority will examine whether any form of regulation like e-
auctioning is required to be put in place for the sale of the mined 
material. While examining this question, they will take into 

12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consideration the data with regard to the royalty and other cess 
etc., which were recovered when e-auctioning was mandatory and post 
the order dated 20.05.2022, whereby private sales have been 
permitted.   
The question of whether satellite mappings/images should be 
undertaken with regard to each mine for the purpose of ascertaining 
the mining activities including the sale and disposal of the waste 
etc., will be examined by the CEC, the Monitoring Committee and the 
Oversight Authority. 
 
The CEC, the Monitoring Committee and the Oversight Authority 
will be entitled to examine any other aspect, which they feel is 
relevant for consideration of the issues and questions referred to 
them. 
In view of the directions given today, the application in I.A 
No. 225561 of 2023 shall await the report of the CEC. Accordingly, 
the application is not finally decided.

I.A. No.149994 of 2018 
 
We are not inclined to accept the prayer(s) made in the 
present application by the applicant – National Mineral Development 
Corporation Limited14 in view of specific orders passed by this 
Court on 23.09.2011, and subsequent order dated 28.09.2012.  
 
It is to be noted that the applicant – NMDC, by a subsequent 
order dated 22.02.2023, was directed a refund of 10% of the sale 
proceeds, deposited towards SPV w.e.f 01.01.2019 onwards. This 
order, according to us, balances out the equities and hence, the 
prayer for reducing the amount to be deposited towards the SPV from 
10% for the period prior to 31.12.2018, is rejected. We clarify 
that the applicant – NMDC will be liable to pay contribution to the 
SPV at the rate of 10% of the sale proceeds w.e.f 01.01.2019 and 
thereafter.  Any excess amount above 10%, collected/paid by the 
applicant – NMDC, on and with effect from 01.01.2019 will be 
refunded to them by the Monitoring Committee within a period of six 
weeks from today.   
 
Accordingly, the present application is disposed of.

disposed of. 
 
I.A. No. 208 of 2014 
 
We are not inclined to examine the merits of the assertions 
made in the application, as the issue involved is rather secondary 
to the issue pending consideration in W.P.(C) no. 562/2009.  In 
case the applicant(s) has any grievance or issue, it will be open 
to the applicant(s) to file appropriate proceedings before the 
jurisdictional High Court or any other authority.   
 
The stay order passed by this order on 10.02.2014 will

I.A. No. 160407 of 2022 
 
Arguments have been addressed by the learned counsel for the 
applicants. The issue is whether a 10% levy imposed on the sale of 
the iron ore and transferred to the SPV for implementing the 
CEPMIZ, in terms of the judgment/order of this Court dated 
13.04.201215, should be discontinued.   
It has been pointed out that Rs.24,464 crores are available to 
the SPV, namely, KMERC, which is to prepare and implement the 
CEPMIZ to mitigate the environmental damage in the Mining Impact 
Zone16 in the three districts.   
Our attention has been drawn to the judgment of this Court 
dated 21.03.2017,17 wherein a similar plea upon being raised, was 
considered, but rejected by this Court, observing that CEPMIZ is a 
scheme, which can be divided into two broad categories:  (i) socio-
economic development; and (ii) integrated mining and railway 
infrastructure, 
industrial 
infrastructure 
and 
medical 
infrastructure.  The said order noted that the total cost of 
implementation of the CEPMIZ over a period of ten years was 
Rs.15,742.35 crores.  The prayer was rejected, observing that at 
that stage, the CEPMIZ was a vision document with all concrete 
measures, steps and proposals left to be worked out at a later 
stage, that is, the stage of the preparation of the Detailed 
Project Report18. We would like to reproduce a portion of the said 
judgment:  
 
15 (2013) 8 SCC 213. 
16 For short, “MIA”. 
17 (2017) 5 SCC 434.

“15. What had happened in Bellary, Chitradurga and 
Tumkur, has already been noticed by this Court in 
para 37 of the judgment dated 18-4-2013 [Samaj 
Parivartana Samudaya v. State of Karnataka, (2013) 8 
SCC 
154] 
i.e. 
systematic, 
extraordinary 
and 
unprecedented plunder of the natural wealth and 
environment. This Court has specifically observed in 
para 
37 
that: 
(Samaj 
Parivartana 
case [Samaj 
Parivartana Samudaya v. State of Karnataka, (2013) 8 
SCC 154] , SCC p. 187) 
“37. … The situation being extraordinary the remedy, 
indeed, must also be extraordinary.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
It is to deal with such an extraordinary situation 
that 
the 
necessity 
of CEPMIZ and 
implementation 
thereof by a special purpose vehicle out of funds in 
credit 
with 
the 
Monitoring 
Committee 
was 
contemplated. The special funds in deposit with the 
Monitoring Committee being the proceeds of illegal 
mining were meant to be deployed for re-creation of 
what had been lost due to such illegal activities. It 
is for the aforesaid purpose that CEPMIZ was required 
to be drawn up and thereafter implemented. The state 
of 
implementation 
of 
the 
Scheme 
has 
not 
yet 
commenced. 
Funds 
in 
huge 
proportions 
would 
be 
necessary. A full and clear picture is yet to emerge. 
In a situation lessees who may be even remotely 
connected with the degradation and destruction of 
nature must continue to pay their share in the 
process 
of 
restitution 
by 
contributing 
to 
the 
Monitoring 
Committee 
from 
their 
present 
sale 
proceeds. Even the new lessees who may not have been 
involved with such degradation are contributing to 
the process of reclamation and restoration. In such a 
situation, we do not see how we can vary or modify 
our earlier orders that require all existing lessees 
to pay 10% of the sale proceeds and/or to depart from 
the requirement of payment of what has been already 
ordered, namely, 10% of the sale proceeds to the 
Monitoring Committee/SPV.” 
   
 
The Court did not make comments on the CEPMIZ, except to state 
that insofar as socio-economic measures are concerned, different 
heads under which restoration and implementation work was proposed 
to be done, details thereof were to be worked out.  It is to be 
noted that at that stage, funds to the extent of Rs.10,336 crores 
were available. 
 
This aspect was again examined in the order dated 21.03.2018 

20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on an application filed by the Federation of Indian Mineral 
Industries, Southern Region19 enclosing therewith reports of the CEC 
dated 19.03.2018.  In this report, the CEC, with reference to the 
CEPMIZ, had suggested submission of a project report by KMERC 
indicating very broadly, different facets of the CEPMIZ, the work 
to be undertaken and the cost, which is reasonably expected to be 
incurred.  Accordingly, this Court rejected the prayer made in the 
application, and stated that the same would be considered 
subsequently.  Directions were issued to KMERC to prepare and 
submit within six months, a revised comprehensive proposal of 
socio-economic development and eco-restoration including those 
relating to road infrastructure with short-term and long-term 
targets and study relating to the railway backbone required to 
support 
the 
mining 
activity, 
as 
suggested 
by 
certain 
authorities/experts. 
 
This Court, in the order dated 21.04.2022, granted in-
principle approval to the CEPMIZ submitted by the State of 
Karnataka, as recommended by the CEC in its reports dated 
22.10.2018 and 16.04.2019.  However, this order also records that 
the parties are at liberty to place any objections or submissions 
before the Oversight Authority with regard to the CEPMIZ.  The 
order states that the Oversight Authority shall decide the 
objections or suggest modifications after hearing the parties and 
taking assistance of any expert including the CEC, as may be 
required.  Further, if any clarification is required, the parties 
were granted liberty to approach this Court. 
 
19 For short, “FIMI, South”. 

21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Oversight Authority constituted by this order was to 
oversee the works and progress being carried out by KMERC. 
 
Our attention was also drawn to the report of the CEC, dated 
10.04.2022, which states that the SPV amount maintained by the 
Monitoring Committee exceeds Rs.20,000 crores as of 31.03.2022.  
This amount including the interest, which will accrue, would be 
adequate to meet the expenses incurred with the activities proposed 
to be undertaken under the CEPMIZ.  This report recommends that 10% 
of the sale value (20% of the sale value from NMDC) being 
contributed towards the SPV, may be discontinued.   
At this stage, we may record that this Court vide order dated 
22.02.2023, reduced the contribution of NMDC to the SPV from 20% to 
10% w.e.f. 01.01.2019 and accordingly, an amount of Rs.1,326 crores 
has been refunded to them. 
 
As per the figures placed before us, the CEPMIZ Plan, as 
provisionally approved by this Court, states that a tentative 
expenditure of nearly Rs.25,000 crores is likely to be incurred for 
various sectors, as tabulated below:-

The total expenditure to be incurred on the projects, which 
stand approved, is about Rs.7,000 crores. 
 
It is an accepted and admitted position that in respect of 51 
Category C mining leases, ICFRE had approved R&R Plans of 28 
leases.  In respect of the remaining 23 leases, inputs have not 
been provided to ICFRE to approve the R&R Plans.  It is also stated 
that 23 lessees of Category C have not submitted any data.  In 
three cases, R&R Plans submitted have not been approved by the CEC. 
 
We do not think, at this stage, it will be appropriate to 
withdraw the 10% levy imposed by this Court in terms of the order 
dated 13.04.2012, as the CEPMIZ Plan is still at the initial stage 
of execution.  The proposed plan was provisionally approved by this 
Court only vide order dated 21.04.2022.  Objections and suggestions 
have been invited and are pending consideration by the Oversight 
Authority.  This apart, we feel certain directions are required to 
be given for preparation of R&R Plans and execution thereof in 
respect of Category C leases, which were terminated/cancelled, but 
thereafter no progress has been made for submission of the plans or 

23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
execution or implementation of R&R Plans. 
 
Accordingly, we deem it appropriate to direct the Principal 
Chief Conservator of Forests20, State of Karnataka to undertake a 
detailed scrutiny and survey of all Category C mines, where data 
and R&R Plans have not been submitted and submit R&R Plans after 
conducting their scrutiny and survey.  PCCF, Karnataka will be 
entitled to procure assistance from domain experts, specialized 
agencies or institutions.  The cost incurred will be paid in the 
interim from the funds available with the SPV.  The R&R Plans will 
be thereupon implemented and executed either through KMERC or if 
more appropriate, through any other agency, which may be nominated 
for this purpose after moving an application before this Court by 
the CEC, the Monitoring Committee, and the Oversight Authority.   
 
The directions given above will equally apply to other cases 
of Categories A and B mines, where R&R Plans have not been 
submitted or approved.  
 
The amount incurred for R&R Plans must be collected from the 
erstwhile Category C lease holders or the Category A and B lease 
holders, as appropriate.  The amount will be collected as arrears 
of land revenue. However, no amount shall be refunded to the new 
lease holders. The amount collected will be deposited with the SPV. 
 
I.A. No. 41984/2023 
 
This application has become infructuous and is disposed of.  
 
We clarify that the applicant will be entitled to file a fresh 
application after this Court has received a report from the CEC in

terms of the directions given above. 
 
I.A. Nos.17247/2020 and 17249/2020 and 17250/2020 
 
I.A. nos. 17247/2020 seeks permission to file application for 
impleadment and 17249/2020 seeks impleadment.  I.A. no. 17250/2020 
has been filed seeking certain directions. 
 
We see no reason to grant the prayer in the applications 
seeking directions to shift the category of the applicant from 
Category C to B.  We have also examined the CEC report no. 23 of 
2022. 
 
All the applications accordingly stand dismissed. 
 
In view of the aforesaid, I.A. Nos. 121324/2022, 121326/2022, 
and I. A. No. 173897/2022 (Application for Additional Documents) 
shall also stand disposed of.

Writ Petition No. 505 of 2020 
 
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent no. 2 – 
State of Karnataka has drawn our attention to the order dated 

25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
28.09.2022 passed in “M/s Arjun Ladha v. The State of Odisha”21. The 
said order specifically refers to the present Writ Petition(C) No. 
505 of 2020. 
 
The period of the lease has expired by flux of time. We do not 
think any relief can be granted to the petitioner(s) in the present 
writ petition, and the same is dismissed.  
 
It is stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner(s) that 
the petitioner(s) would like to challenge the fresh auction. It 
will be open to the petitioner(s) to challenge the fresh auction in 
accordance with law. However, we make no comments either way in 
this regard.  
 
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
