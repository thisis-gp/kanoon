The perennial question in income tax jurisprudence, whether 
reopening of a concluded assessment i.e. reassessment under Section 
147 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (briefly “the Act” hereinafter) following 
issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act is legally sustainable or 
is bad in law, is again confronting us in the present batch of appeals. The

Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Cochin Bench, Cochin (‘Tribunal’ 
hereinafter) had decided in favour of the assessee by setting aside the 
orders of reassessment. However, the High Court of Kerala in appeals 
filed by the revenue under Section 260A of the Act has reversed the 
findings of the Tribunal by deciding the appeals preferred by the revenue 
in its favour. 
2. 
 
Aggrieved by the aforesaid orders passed by the High Court of 
Kerala (briefly “the High Court” hereinafter), the assessee had preferred 
special leave petitions to appeal before this Court and on leave being 
granted, civil appeals have been registered. 
3. 
 
We have heard Mr. Raghenth Basant, learned counsel for the 
appellant/assessee (which would be referred to either as the appellant or 
as the assessee) and Mr. Shyam Gopal, learned counsel for the 
respondent/revenue (again, would be referred to either as the respondent 
or as the revenue). 
4. 
 
A brief narration of facts is necessary. 
5. 
 
For the sake of convenience, we may refer to civil appeal Nos. 
8580, 8581 and 8582 of 2011 (M/s Mangalam Publications, Kottayam 
Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, Kottayam). 
6. 
 
The above three civil appeals pertain to assessment years 
1990-91, 1991-92 and 1992-93. 

3 
 
 
 
7. 
 
The assessee was a partnership firm at the relevant point of 
time though it got itself registered as a company since the assessment 
year 1994-95. The assessee is carrying on the business of publishing 
newspaper, weeklies and other periodicals in several languages under the 
brand name “Mangalam”. Prior to the assessment year 1994-95 including 
the assessment years under consideration, the status of the assessee was 
that of a firm, being regularly assessed to income tax. 
8. 
 
For the assessment year 1990-91, assessee filed return of 
income on 22.10.1991 showing loss of Rs.5,99,390.00. Subsequently, the 
assessee filed a revised computation showing income at Rs.5,63,920.00. 
Assessee did not file any balance sheet alongwith the return of income on 
the ground that books of account were seized by the income tax 
department (department) in the course of search and seizure operations 
on 03.12.1995 and that those books of account were not yet returned. In 
the assessment proceedings, the assessing officer did not accept the 
contention of the assessee and made an analysis of the incomings and 
outgoings of the assessee for the previous year under consideration. After 
considering various heads of income and sale of publications, the 
assessing officer made a lumpsum addition of Rs. 1 lakh to the disclosed 
income vide the assessment order dated 29.01.1992 passed under 
Section 143 (3) of the Act. 

4 
 
 
 
9. 
 
Likewise, for the assessment year 1991-1992, the assessee 
did not file any balance sheet along with the return of income for the 
same reason mentioned for the assessment year 1990-1991. The return 
of income was filed on 22.10.1991 showing a loss of Rs.21,66,760.00. 
As per the revised profit and loss account, the sale proceeds of the 
publications were shown at Rs.8,21,24,873.00. Assessing officer 
scrutinised the net sale proceeds as per the Audit Bureau of Circulation 
figure and the certified Performance Audit Report. On that basis 
assessing officer accepted the sale proceeds of Rs.8,21,24,873.00 as 
correct being in conformity with the facts and figures available in the 
Audit Bureau of Circulation report and the Performance Audit Report. 
After considering the incomings and outgoings of the relevant previous 
year assessing officer reworked the aforesaid figures but found that 
there was a deficiency of Rs.29,17,931.00 in the incoming and outgoing 
statement which the assessee could not explain. Accordingly, this 
amount was added to the total income of the assessee. Further, the 
assessee could not produce proper vouchers in respect of a number of 
items of expenditure. Accordingly, an addition of Rs.1,50,000.00 was 
made to the total income of the assessee vide the assessment order 
dated 29.01.2022 passed under Section 143 (3) of the Act. 
10. 
 
For the assessment year 1992-1993 also, the assessee filed 
the return of income on 07.12.1992 showing a loss of Rs.10,50,000.00. 
However, a revised return was filed subsequently on 28.01.1993 

5 
 
 
 
showing loss of Rs.44,75,212.00. Like the earlier years, assessee did not 
maintain books of account and did not file the balance sheet for the 
same reason. However, the assessee disclosed total sale proceeds of the 
weeklies at Rs.7,16,95,530.00 and also advertisement receipts to the 
extent of Rs.40 lakhs. The profit was estimated at Rs.41,63,500.00 
before allowing depreciation. 
10.1.  
On scrutiny of the performance certificate issued by the 
Audit Bureau of Circulation, the assessing officer observed that total 
sale proceeds of the weeklies after allowing sale commission came to 
Rs.7,22,94,757.00. Following the profit percentage adopted in earlier 
years, the assessing officer estimated the income from the weeklies and 
other periodicals at 7.50% before depreciation, adding the estimated 
advertisement receipts of Rs.40 lakhs to the total sale receipts of 
Rs.7,22,94,757.00. The assessing officer held that the total receipt from 
sale of weeklies and periodicals came to Rs.7,62,94,757.00. The profit 
earned before depreciation at the rate of 7.50% on the turnover came to 
Rs.57,22,106.00. In respect of the daily newspaper, the assessing officer 
worked out the loss at Rs.22,95,872.00 as against the loss of 
Rs.41,23,500.00 claimed by the assessee. Taking an overall view of the 
matter, the assessing officer estimated the business income of the 
assessee during the assessment year 1992-1993 at Rs.10,00,000.00 
vide the assessment order dated 26.03.1993 passed under Section 
143(3) of the Act. 

6 
 
 
 
11. 
 
It may be mentioned that for the assessment year 1993-
1994, the assessee had submitted the profit and loss account as well as 
the balance sheet along with the return of income. While examining the 
balance sheet, the assessing officer noticed that the balance in the 
capital account of all the partners of the assessee firm together was 
Rs.1,85,75,455.00 as on 31.03.1993 whereas the capital of the partners 
as on 31.12.1985 was only Rs.2,55,117.00. According to the assessing 
officer, none of the partners had any other source of income apart from 
one of the partners, Smt. Cleramma Vargese, who had a business under 
the name and style of “Mangalam Finance”. As the income assessed for 
all the years was found to be not commensurate with the increase in 
the capital by Rs.1,83,20,338.00 (Rs.1,85,75,455.00 – Rs.2,55,117.00) 
from 1985 to 1993, it was considered necessary to reassess the income 
of the assessee as well as that of the partners for the assessment years 
1988-1989 to 1993-1994. After obtaining the approval of the 
Commissioner of Income Tax, Trivandrum, notice under Section 148 of 
the Act was issued and served upon the assessee on 29.03.2000. 
12. 
 
In respect of the assessment year 1990-1991, the assessee 
informed the assessing officer that the return of income filed which 
culminated in the assessment order dated 29.01.1992 may be 
considered as the return in the reassessment proceedings. The 
assessing officer took cognizance of the profit and loss account and the 
balance sheet filed by the assessee before the South Indian Bank on the 

7 
 
 
 
basis of which assessment of income for the assessment years 1988 - 
1989 and 1989 - 1990 were completed. Objection of the assessee that 
the aforesaid balance sheet was prepared only for the purpose of 
obtaining loan from the South Indian Bank and therefore could not be 
relied upon for income tax assessment was brushed aside. The 
reassessment was made on the basis of the accounts submitted to the 
South Indian Bank. By the reassessment order dated 21.03.2002 
passed under Section 144/147 of the Act, the assessing officer 
quantified the total income of the assessee at Rs.29,66,910.00 
whereafter order was passed allocating income among the partners. 
13. 
 
Likewise, for the assessment year 1991-1992, the assessing 
officer passed reassessment order dated 21.03.2002 under Section 
144/147 of the Act determining total income at Rs.13,91,700.00. 
Following the same, allocation of income was also made amongst the 
partners. 
14. 
 
In so far assessment year 1992-1993 is concerned, the 
assessing officer passed the reassessment order also on 21.03.2002 
under Section 144/147 of the Act determining the total income of the 
assessee at Rs.25,06,660.00. Thereafter allocation of income was made 
amongst the partners in the manner indicated in the order of 
reassessment. 

8 
 
 
 
15. 
 
At this stage, we may mention that the assessing officer had 
worked out the escaped income for the three assessment years of 1990-
91, 1991-92 and 1992-93 at Rs.50,96,041.00. This amount was further 
apportioned between the three assessment years in proportion to the 
sales declared by the assessee in the aforesaid assessment years as 
under: 
Sr. No. 
Assessment year 
Amount 
1. 
1990-91 
Rs.19,05,476.00 
2. 
1991-92 
Rs.16,83,910.00 
3. 
1992-93 
Rs.15,06,655.00 
           Total 
Rs.50,96,041.00  
rounded off to Rs.50,96,040.00 
 
16. 
 
Against the aforesaid three reassessment orders for the 
assessment years 1990-91, 1991-92 and 1992-93, assessee preferred 
three appeals before the first appellate authority i.e. Commissioner of 
Income Tax (Appeals), IV Cochin (briefly “the CIT(A)” hereinafter). 
Assessee raised the ground that it had disclosed all material facts 
necessary for completing the assessments. The assessments having 
been completed under Section 143(3) of the Act, the assessments could 
not have been reopened after expiry of four years from the end of the 
relevant assessment year as per the proviso to Section 147 of the Act. It 
was pointed out that the limitation period for the last of the three 

9 
 
 
 
assessment years i.e. 1992-93, had expired on 31.03.1997 whereas the 
notices under Section 148 of the Act were issued and served on the 
assessee only on 29.03.2000. Therefore, all the three reassessment 
proceedings were barred by limitation. The assessee also argued that 
the alleged income escaping assessment could not be computed on an 
estimate basis. In the present case, the assessing officer had allocated 
the alleged escaped income for the three assessment years in proportion 
to the corresponding sales turnover. It was further argued that as per 
Section 282(2), notice under Section 148 of the Act in the case of a 
partnership firm was required to be made to a member of the firm. In 
the present case, the notices were issued to the partnership firm. 
Therefore, such notices could not be treated as valid. 
16.1.  
CIT(A) rejected all the above contentions urged by the 
assessee. CIT(A) relied on Section 139(9)(f) of the Act and thereafter held 
that the assessee had not furnished the details as per the aforesaid 
provisions and therefore fell short of the requirements specified therein. 
Vide the common appellate order dated 26.02.2004, CIT(A) held that, as 
the assessee had failed to disclose all material facts necessary to make 
assessments, therefore it could not be said that the reassessment 
proceedings were barred by limitation in terms of the proviso to Section 
147. The other two grounds raised by the assessee were also repelled 
by the first appellate authority. Thereafter, CIT(A) made a detailed 
examination of the factual aspect whereafter it proposed enhancement 

10 
 
 
 
of the quantum of escaped income. Following the same, CIT(A) 
enhanced the assessment by fixing the unexplained income at 
Rs.1,44,02,560.00 for the assessment years 1987-88 to 1993-94 which 
was thereafter apportioned in respect of the relevant three assessment 
years. The pro-rata allotment of escaped income for the three 
assessment years as directed by CIT(A) are as follows: 
Sr. No. 
Assessment year 
Escaped income 
1. 
1990-91 
Rs.24,98,755.00 
2. 
1991-92 
Rs.23,01,204.00  
3. 
1992-93 
Rs.20,20,895.00  
             Total 
Rs.68,20,854.00 
 
16.2.  
Thus, 
as 
against 
the 
total 
escaped 
income 
of 
Rs.50,96,040.00 for the above three assessment years as quantified by 
the assessing officer, CIT(A) enhanced and redetermined such income 
at Rs.68,20,854.00. 
16.3.  
However, it would be relevant to mention that CIT(A) in the 
appellate order had noted that the assessee had filed its balance sheet 
as on 31.12.1985 while filing the return of income for the assessment 
year 1986-87. The next balance sheet was filed as on 31.03.1993. No 
balance sheet was filed in the interregnum on the ground that it could 
not maintain proper books of accounts as the relevant materials were 

11 
 
 
 
seized by the department in the course of a search and seizure operation 
and not yet returned. CIT(A) further noted that the assessing officer had 
taken the balance sheet as on 31.03.1989 filed by the assessee before 
the South Indian Bank as the base for reconciling the accounts of the 
partners. It was noticed that CIT(A) in an earlier appellate order dated 
26.03.2002 for the assessment year 1989-90 in the assessee’s own case 
had held that the profit and loss account and the balance sheet 
furnished to the South Indian Bank were not reliable. CIT(A) in the 
present proceedings agreed with such finding of his predecessor and 
held that the unexplained portion, if any, of the increase in capital and 
current account balance with the assessee had to be analysed on the 
basis of the balance sheet filed before the assessing officer as on 
31.12.1985 and as on 31.03.1993. 
17. 
 
Aggrieved by the common appellate order passed by the 
CIT(A) dated 26.02.2004, assessee preferred three separate appeals 
before the Tribunal which were registered as under: 
(i)    ITA No. 282(Coch)/2004 for the assessment year 1990-91. 
(ii)   ITA No. 283(Coch)/2004 for the assessment year 1991-92. 
(iii)  ITA No. 284(Coch)/2004 for the assessment year 1992-93. 
 
 
17.1.  
In the three appeals filed by the assessee, revenue also filed 
cross objections.  
17.2.  
By the common order dated 29.10.2004, the Tribunal 
allowed the appeals filed by the assessee and set aside the orders of 

12 
 
 
 
reassessment for the three assessment years as affirmed and enhanced 
by the CIT(A). Tribunal held that the re-examination carried out by the 
assessing officer was not based on any fresh material or evidence. The 
reassessment orders could not be sustained on the basis of the balance 
sheet filed by the assessee before the South Indian Bank because in an 
earlier appeal of the assessee itself, CIT(A) had held that such balance 
sheet and profit and loss account furnished to the bank were not 
reliable. The original assessments were completed under Section 143(3) 
of the Act. Therefore, it was not possible to hold that the assessee had 
not furnished necessary details for completing the assessments at the 
time of original assessment. In such circumstances, Tribunal held that 
the case of the assessee squarely fell within the four corners of the 
proviso to Section 147. Consequently, the reassessments were held to 
be barred by limitation, thus without jurisdiction. While allowing the 
appeals of the assessee, Tribunal dismissed the cross objections filed 
by the revenue. 
18. 
 
Against the aforesaid common order of the Tribunal, the 
respondent preferred three appeals before the High Court under Section 
260A of the Act, being IT Appeal Nos. 400, 557 and 558 of 2009 for the 
assessment years 1990-91, 1991-92 and 1992-93 respectively. All the 
three appeals were allowed by the High Court vide the common order 
dated 12.10.2009. According to the High Court, the finding of the 
Tribunal that the assessee had disclosed fully and truly all material 

13 
 
 
 
facts necessary for completion of the original assessments was not 
tenable. Holding that there was no material before the Tribunal to come 
to the conclusion that the assessee had disclosed fully and truly all 
material facts required for completion of original assessments, the High 
Court set aside the order of the Tribunal and remanded the appeals 
back to the Tribunal to consider the appeals on merit after issuing 
notice to the parties. 
19. 
 
It is against this order that the assessee had filed the special 
leave petitions which on leave being granted have been registered as 
civil appeals. The related civil appeals have been filed by the partners of 
the assessee firm which would be dependent on the outcome of the 
present set of civil appeals. 
20. 
 
Respondent has filed counter affidavit supporting the 
judgment under appeal. It is contended that the High Court has 
correctly appreciated the facts and the law and thereafter given a 
reasoned order as to why the reopening of assessment is valid. High 
Court has correctly held that the assessee had not disclosed fully and 
truly all the material facts necessary for completion of the assessments.  
Adverting to Section 139 (9) of the Act, it is submitted that, it is not 
mandatory for the assessing officer to treat a return as invalid even if 
the return is defective under any of the sub-clauses of Section 139 (9). 
It is the discretion of the assessing officer to issue notice. Since no notice 

14 
 
 
 
was issued, the return and the assessment made thereon would be 
valid.  
20.1.  
It is submitted that the assessee had not even had accounts 
pertaining to the advertisement receipts which is a major source of 
income of a publication entity; as a matter of fact, the assessee had 
shown the income from advertisements on estimation basis. 
20.2.  
Though the assessee had been claiming that it did not 
maintain any books of account from the assessment years 1989- 1990 
onwards, an audited balance sheet and profit and loss account 
submitted to the South Indian Bank were traced out and used as 
evidence against the assessee for reopening the assessment for the 
assessment year 1989- 1990. In the first appellate proceedings, CIT(A) 
took the view that the profit shown in the statement was for availing 
credit facility only and therefore set aside the reopening of assessment. 
Though the Tribunal concurred with the view of CIT(A), the department 
filed an appeal before the High Court. The assessing officer had 
compared the balance of the partners in their capital account in the 
firm in the said balance sheet (filed before the bank) with capital in the 
balance sheet filed for the assessment year 1993 – 1994 and thereafter 
determined the probable escapement of income which is fully justified 
and rightly upheld by the High Court. 

15 
 
 
 
20.3.  
 
Respondent has contended that in the original 
assessments the assessing officer had made the assessments on the 
basis of limited information furnished by the assessee. The assessing 
officer made the reassessments on the basis of the increase in the 
capital in the balance sheets between the years ending 31.03.1989 and 
31.03.1993. Respondent has denied that the reassessments were made 
on the basis of change of opinion. An audited balance sheet for the 
period ending 31.12.1984 was available with the department. 
Thereafter, no audited or unaudited balance sheets were furnished on 
the ground that books of account could not be maintained. However, an 
audited balance sheet for the period ending 31.03.1993 was furnished 
in the course of the assessment proceedings for the assessment year 
1993 – 1994. Another balance sheet for the period ending 31.03.1989 
which was claimed by the assessee to be an account prepared only for 
submission before the South Indian Bank for availing loan could be 
traced out. A perusal of the balance sheet for the assessment year 1993-
1994 revealed that the increase in capital was not commensurate with 
the income assessed on estimation basis by the assessing officer for the 
assessment years 1989 – 1990 to 1992-1993. It was in view of such 
changed circumstances that notices under Section 148 were issued. 
The original assessments for the assessment years 1990 – 1991, 1991 
– 1992 and 1992 – 1993 were completed on 29.01.1992, 29.01.1992 
and 26.03.1993 respectively. The balance sheet for the assessment year 

16 
 
 
 
1993 – 1994 which was used as the basis for reassessment was not 
available with the assessing officer when the original assessments were 
made. Facts available with the assessing officer in the original 
assessments and in the reassessments were different. Since facts were 
different, question of any change in the opinion did not arise. In the 
circumstances respondent sought for dismissal of the special leave 
petitions since registered as civil appeals. 
21. 
 
Mr. Raghenth Basant, learned counsel for the appellant at 
the outset submits that the High Court fell in error while setting aside 
the well-reasoned and correct order of the Tribunal. Order of the High 
Court should be set aside and the order of the Tribunal restored. 
21.1.  
He submits that the appellant is a partnership firm engaged 
in the business of publication of newspaper, weeklies and other 
periodicals under the brand name “Mangalam”. Being an assessee 
under the Act it was maintaining proper books of accounts and had filed 
profit and loss accounts as well as balance sheets along with the returns 
of income till the assessment year 1985 – 1986. A search operation was 
carried out by officials of the department under Section 132 of the Act 
in the business premises of the appellant on 31.12.1985. In the said 
search operation, books of account, registers and ledgers of the 
appellant were seized. Because of the aforesaid, the appellant was 
unable to maintain proper books of account as it was not possible for it 

17 
 
 
 
to obtain ledger balances to be brought down for the succeeding 
accounting years. Nonetheless, appellant maintained primary books of 
account and used to prepare profit and loss accounts. It also used to 
prepare a statement of source and application of funds in support of the 
income returned by it in the returns of income. Being a member of the 
Audit Bureau of Circulation, appellant was also required to maintain 
exhaustive details regarding printing and sale of newspaper and other 
periodicals published by it. 
21.2.  
Learned counsel submits that returns were filed by the 
appellant for the three assessment years in question. Those returns 
were supported by profit and loss accounts and statements showing the 
source and application of funds. Assessments for the three assessment 
years were carried out and completed under Section 143 (3) of the Act 
after making additions and providing for certain disallowances. He 
submits that for the assessment year 1993–1994, the appellant had 
maintained complete set of books of account, audited profit and loss 
account and balance sheet which were duly filed before the assessing 
officer. Following assessment proceedings, assessing officer passed the 
assessment order for the assessment year 1993 – 1994 on 27.01.1994 
under Section 143 (3) of the Act.  
21.3.  
More than eight to ten years after expiry of the relevant 
assessment years, appellant was served with notices dated 29.03.2000 

18 
 
 
 
issued under Section 148 of the Act for the assessment years 1990 – 
1991, 1991 – 1992 and 1992 – 1993. He submits that the basis for 
reassessment was purportedly comparison of the current and capital 
accounts of the partners of the assessee firm in the balance sheet filed 
along with the return for the assessment year 1993 – 1994 with the 
capital and current accounts of the partners as on 31.12.1985, which 
showed unexplained increase. The revenue also sought to rely upon the 
balance sheet for the assessment year 1988 – 1989 obtained by the 
assessing officer from the South Indian Bank which was submitted by 
the assessee to the said bank to avail credit facility. He submits that on 
such comparison the assessing officer came to an erroneous conclusion 
that the profits for the assessment years 1990 – 1991, 1991 – 1992 and 
1992 -1993 would be Rs.1,86,57,246.00 and as the assessment for the 
said years came to Rs.16,64,518.00 only, there was an under 
assessment of income to the tune of Rs.1,69,92,728.00. 
21.4.  
Learned counsel submits that during the reassessment 
proceedings assessee sought for return of the books seized by the 
department. Though some books were returned, the entire seized 
materials were not returned. As it was an old matter assessee had 
sought for time to look into the old records and to consult its 
representative. However, the assessing officer declined to grant time and 
went ahead and passed the reassessment orders ex parte under Section 
144/147 of the Act. He submits that the assessing officer made the 

19 
 
 
 
reassessment on a comparison of the increase in the capital and current 
accounts of the partners for the period from 1986 to 1993. According to 
him, the assessing officer could not have done that because the balance 
sheet for the assessment year 1989 – 1990, which was obtained by the 
assessing officer from the South Indian Bank, was not prepared on 
actual and current accounts; that was prepared on provisional and 
estimate basis in the absence of the account books which were seized 
by the department, that too, only for the purpose of obtaining credit 
facilities from the bank. 
21.5.  
It is the submission of learned counsel for the assessee that 
the High Court has erred in holding that even in the absence of the 
entire books of accounts, the assessee had not furnished the documents 
and particulars required under Section 139 (9) (f) of the Act. According 
to the High Court since the original assessment was completed without 
the books of account and the details under Section 139 (9) (f) being 
furnished, therefore, the assessee had not disclosed fully and truly all 
material facts necessary for completion of assessment. Learned counsel 
submits that for non-furnishing of particulars under Section 139 (9) (f) 
the original assessment would be rendered invalid. However, the 
assessing officer did not adopt the aforesaid course of action but instead 
proceeded to complete the assessments under Section 143 (3) of the Act. 
In the circumstances, he submits that non furnishing of details under 
Section 139 (9) (f) cannot lead to any inference that material facts had 

20 
 
 
 
not been disclosed so as to justify reopening of assessments that too 
eight to ten years after expiry of the relevant assessment years. 
21.6.  
Learned counsel asserts that even though the assessee was 
not maintaining regular books of accounts, all relevant details 
necessary for making the assessments were furnished before the 
assessing officer. These included detailed cash flow statements, profit 
and loss accounts, statements showing the source and application of 
funds reflecting the increase in the capital and current accounts of the 
partners of the assessee firm etc. It was thereafter that assessments 
were completed not only in respect of the assessee for the above three 
assessment years but also for the partners as well under Section 143(3) 
of the Act. 
21.7.  
It is contended by learned counsel for the assessee that 
there was no specific information before the assessing officer wherefrom 
he could form a reason to believe that income exigible to income tax had 
escaped assessment for the three assessment years. The only reason for 
initiating reassessment proceedings was the impression of the 
assessing officer that there was an increase in the capital and current 
accounts of the partners upon a comparison of the balance sheets for 
the assessment year 1985 – 1986 and for the assessment year 1993 – 
1994 which could not be properly explained. The assessing officer also 
formed the above belief on the basis of the balance sheet for the 

21 
 
 
 
assessment year 1989 – 1990 which was obtained from the South 
Indian Bank. According to him, on both counts, the revenue could not 
have initiated proceedings for reopening of concluded assessments that 
too under Section 143 (3) of the Act. He submits that CIT(A), in the 
appeal of the assessee for the assessment year 1989 -1990, had clearly 
held that such a balance sheet submitted before the bank was not 
reliable. Learned counsel asserts that an assessing officer would get the 
jurisdiction to reopen an assessment only on the basis of specific, 
reliable and relevant information coming to his possession subsequent 
to the original assessment and not otherwise. In support of such 
submission learned counsel has relied upon the decisions of this Court 
in: 
(i) M/s Phool Chand Bajrang Lal Vs. Income Tax Officer,  
(1993) 4 SCC 77. 
(ii) Srikrishna Private Limited Vs. ITO, Calcutta,  
(1996) 9 SCC 534. 
21.8.  
Summing up his submissions, learned counsel submits that 
as rightly held by the Tribunal, it was the change of view of the assessing 
officer upon assessing the comparative accounts of the partners which 
led to the reassessments which is not based on any fresh material or 
evidence. It is evident that the assessing officer had only reviewed the 
original assessments on the basis of a fresh application of mind to the 
same set of facts. Therefore, it is a clear case of change of opinion 
leading to reassessment proceedings which is not permissible in law as 

22 
 
 
 
held by this Court in CIT, Delhi Vs. Kelvinator of India Limited, (2010) 2 
SCC 723. He therefore submits that the order of the High Court is liable 
to be set aside and that of the Tribunal restored.  
22. 
 
Mr. Shyam Gopal, learned counsel for the respondent at the 
outset submits that there is no merit at all in the civil appeals, and 
therefore, the civil appeals should be dismissed. 
22.1.  
Adverting to Section 145 (1) of the Act, he submits that 
income from the profits of business shall be computed in accordance 
with the cash or mercantile or any other system of accounting regularly 
employed by the assessee. Since the business income had to be 
computed by following the method of accounting adopted by the 
assessee and based on the books of accounts so maintained, the 
assessee was required to produce the books of accounts but when the 
books of accounts were not available, at least to furnish the particulars 
in terms of Section 139 (9) (f) of the Act. 
22.2.  
Referring to Section 139 (9) (f) of the Act, he submits that 
even in the absence of regular books of accounts, the assessee is bound 
to provide the information required under the aforesaid provision. An 
assessee who does not disclose the above information and instead 
submits returns on estimation basis cannot claim that it has fully and 
truly disclosed all material facts required for assessment. 

23 
 
 
 
22.3.  
According to Mr. Gopal, Tribunal erred in holding that the 
assessee had disclosed fully and truly all material facts necessary for 
assessment. In fact, Tribunal did not go into the merit of the case. 
Rather, Tribunal held that there were no materials before the assessing 
officer to take the view that income chargeable to tax had escaped 
assessment. 
22.4.  
Learned counsel for the revenue strenuously argued that 
assessing officer had made a comparative analysis of the two balance 
sheets, one as on 31.12.1985 relevant to the assessment year 1986-
1987 and the balance sheet dated 31.03.1994 relevant to the 
assessment year 1994–1995 and found therefrom unexplained increase 
in the capital and current accounts of the partners. That apart, the 
assessing officer also obtained a balance sheet for the assessment year 
1988–1989 from the South Indian Bank which also indicated 
unexplained profits and gains of the partners. It was thereafter that 
reassessment proceedings were initiated. First appellate authority i.e. 
CIT(A) not only affirmed the reassessment orders of the assessing officer 
but also enhanced the quantum of escaped income which was restored 
by the High Court after setting aside the reversal order of the Tribunal. 
22.5.  
Learned counsel for the respondent has submitted a 
convenience compilation and drew the attention of the Court therefrom 
to the relevant provisions of the Act i.e. Section 139 (9), 143, 144, 145, 

24 
 
 
 
147, 148, 149 and 151 of the Act, both pre 01.04.1989 and post 
01.04.1989. He submits that there was admittedly non-disclosure of 
material facts by the assessee, and, therefore, the extended period 
under the proviso to Section 147 of the Act was available to the 
department. Viewed in the above context, the notices issued under 
Section 148 of the Act as well as the orders of reassessment passed 
under Section 144/147 of the Act were within limitation.  
22.6.  
Learned counsel has specifically referred to Section 149 of 
the Act which deals with the time limit for issuance of notice under 
Section 148 of the Act. Post amendment with effect from 01.04.1989, 
he submits that under Section 149 (1) (b) (iii), the limitation is, if seven 
years but not more than ten years had elapsed from the relevant 
assessment year unless the income chargeable to tax which has 
escaped assessment amounts to or is likely to amount to rupees fifty 
thousand or more for that year. In the instant case, the quantum of 
escaped assessment is admittedly in excess of rupees fifty thousand. 
Therefore, the notices issued under Section 148 of the Act on 
29.03.2000 for the three assessment years of 1990 – 1991, 1991 – 1992 
and 1992 – 1993 were well within the limitation period. 
22.7.  
Learned counsel has referred to the decision of this Court in 
Calcutta Discount Company Limited Vs. Income Tax Officer, (1961) 41 ITR 
1991 and submits that the duty of disclosing all the primary facts 

25 
 
 
 
relevant to assessment before the assessing authority lies on the 
assessee. Only when all the primary facts are disclosed, the burden 
would shift to the assessing authority.  
22.8.  
Asserting that the order of the High Court is fully justified, 
learned counsel seeks dismissal of the civil appeals.  
23. 
 
Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties have 
received the due consideration of the Court. 
24. 
 
At the outset, we may advert to certain provisions of the Act 
as existed at the relevant point of time having a bearing on the present 
lis. Chapter XIV of the Act comprising Sections 139 to 158 deals with 
procedure for assessment. Section 139 mandates filing of income tax 
return. At the relevant point of time, this provision provided that every 
person, if his total income or the total income of any other person in 
respect of whom he was assessable under the Act during the previous 
year had exceeded the maximum amount which is not chargeable to 
income tax, he shall on or before the due date furnish a return of his 
income or the income of such other person during the previous year in 
the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner, setting forth 
such other particulars as may be prescribed. 
24.1.  
Since reference was made to sub-section (9)(f) of Section 
139, both in the pleadings and in the oral hearing, we may mention that 
under sub-section (9) of Section 139, where the assessing officer 

26 
 
 
 
considers that the return of income furnished by the assessee is 
defective, he may intimate the defect to the assessee and give him an 
opportunity to rectify the defect within a period of fifteen days from the 
date of such intimation or within such further period, the assessing 
officer may in his discretion allow. If the defect is not rectified within the 
specified period or within the further period as may be allowed, the 
return shall be treated as an invalid return. In such an eventuality, it 
would be construed that the assessee had failed to furnish the return. 
There is an Explanation below sub-section (9) which clarifies that a 
return of income shall be regarded as defective unless all the conditions 
mentioned thereunder are fulfilled. Clause (f) says that where regular 
books of account are not maintained by the assessee but the return is 
accompanied by a statement indicating the amounts of turnover or 
gross receipts, gross profit, expenses and net profit of the business or 
profession and the basis on which such amounts have been computed 
and also disclosing the amounts of total sundry debtors, sundry 
creditors, stock in trade and cash balance as at the end of the previous 
year, such a return shall not be treated as defective.  
24.2.  
Thus, Section 139 places an obligation upon every person to 
furnish voluntarily a return of his total income if such income during 
the relevant previous year had exceeded the maximum amount which 
is not chargeable to income tax. Under sub-section (9), if there are 
defects in the return which are not rectified within the stipulated period 

27 
 
 
 
after being intimated by the assessing officer, the return of income 
would be treated as an invalid return. Of course, it would not be treated 
as defective and consequently invalid if in a case, such as, under clause 
(f) where regular books of account are not maintained but the return of 
income is accompanied by a statement indicating the amounts of 
turnover etc. 
25. 
 
Section 142 deals with enquiry before assessment. As per 
sub-section (1), the assessing officer may issue notice upon an assessee 
who has made a return seeking details of such accounts, information 
or documents etc. which may be necessary for the purpose of making 
an assessment. Sub-section (2) empowers the assessing officer to make 
such enquiry as he considers necessary for obtaining full information 
and sub-section (3) requires the assessing officer to provide an 
opportunity of hearing to the assessee in respect of any material 
gathered on the basis of the enquiry. 
26. 
 
This takes us to Section 143 which is the provision for 
assessment. As per sub-section (1), where a return is made under 
Section 139 or in response to a notice under Section 142(1), the 
assessing officer may carry out adjustments in accordance with law and 
thereafter, issue intimation to the assessee specifying the sums payable. 
Such intimation shall be deemed to be a notice of demand under Section 
156 of the Act. 

28 
 
 
 
26.1.  
Sub-section (2)  provides that where a return has been 
furnished under Section 139 or in response to a notice under sub-
section (1) of Section 142, to ensure that the assessee has not under-
stated the income or has not computed excessive loss or has not under-
paid the tax in any manner, the assessing officer shall serve on the 
assessee a notice to produce evidence in support of the claim made by 
the assessee. 
26.2.  
As per sub-section (3) of Section 143, after hearing such 
evidence as the assessee may produce and such other evidence as the 
assessing officer may require on specified points and after taking into 
account all relevant material which he has gathered, the assessing 
officer shall make an assessment of the total income or loss of the 
assessee by an order in writing. In the said exercise, he shall determine 
the sum payable by the assessee or refund of any amount due to him 
on the basis of such assessment. 
27. 
 
Section 144 provides for best judgment assessment. It says 
that if any person fails to submit a return under sub-section (1) of 
Section 139 or fails to comply with the terms of a notice under sub-
section (1) of Section 142 or having made a return fails to comply with 
all the terms of a notice issued under sub-section (2) of Section 143, the 
assessing officer after taking into account all relevant materials and 
after giving the assessee an opportunity of being heard make the 

29 
 
 
 
assessment to the best of his judgment and determine the sum payable 
by the assessee on the basis of such assessment. 
28.  This brings us to the pivotal section i.e. Section 147. Prior to the 
Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987, Section 147 read as under: 
  147. Income escaping assessment.—If 
(a) the Income Tax Officer has reason to 
believe that, by reason of the omission or 
failure on the part of an assessee to make a 
return under Section 139 for any assessment 
year to the Income Tax Officer or to disclose 
fully and truly all material facts necessary for 
his 
assessment 
for 
that 
year, 
income 
chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for 
that year, or 
 
(b) notwithstanding that there has been no 
omission or failure as mentioned in clause (a) 
on the part of the assessee, the Income Tax 
Officer has in consequence of information in 
his possession reason to believe that income 
chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for 
any assessment year, 
 
he may, subject to the provisions of Sections 
148 to 153, assess or reassess such income or 
recompute 
the 
loss 
or 
the 
depreciation 
allowance, as the case may be, for the 
assessment year concerned (hereafter in 
Sections 148 to 153 referred to as the relevant 
assessment year). 
                 
28.1.  
This provision was amended by the Direct Tax Laws 
(Amendment) Act, 1987 with effect from 01.04.1989. Post such 
amendment, Section 147 read as under:  
147. Income 
escaping 
assessment.—If 
the 
assessing officer, for reasons to be recorded by 

30 
 
 
 
him in writing, is of the opinion that any 
income 
chargeable 
to 
tax 
has 
escaped 
assessment for any assessment year, he may, 
subject to the provisions of Sections 148 to 
153, assess or reassess such income and also 
any other income chargeable to tax which has 
escaped assessment and which comes to his 
notice subsequently in the course of the 
proceedings under this section, or recompute 
the loss or the depreciation allowance or any 
other allowance, as the case may be, for the 
assessment year concerned (hereafter in this 
section and in Sections 148 to 153 referred to 
as the relevant assessment year). 
 
28.2.  
As can be seen from the above, prior to 01.04.1989, the 
income tax officer was required to have reason to believe that by reason 
of the omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return 
under Section 139 for any assessment year or to disclose fully and truly 
all material facts necessary for such assessment, income chargeable to 
tax had escaped assessment for that assessment year or the income tax 
officer had in consequence of information in his possession reason to 
believe that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment for any 
assessment year, the income tax officer could reopen an assessment. 
But with effect from 01.04.1989, the requirement of law underwent a 
change. It was sufficient if the assessing officer for reasons to be 
recorded by him in writing was of the opinion that any income 
chargeable to tax had escaped assessment for any assessment year, he 
could assess or reassess such income chargeable to tax which had 
escaped assessment and which came to his notice subsequently. 

31 
 
 
 
Therefore, post 01.04.1989, the power to reopen an assessment became 
much wider.  
28.3.  
It appears that a number of representations were received 
against the omission of the words “reason to believe” from Section 147 
and their substitution by the word “opinion” of the assessing officer. It 
was pointed out by the representationists that the meaning of the 
expression “reason to believe” was explained in a number of judgments 
and was well settled. Omission of such an expression from Section 147 
would give arbitrary powers to the assessing officer to reopen past 
assessments. To allay such apprehensions, Parliament enacted the 
Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1989 again amending Section 147 
by re-introducing the expression “reason to believe”. Section 147 after 
the amendment carried out by the Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 
1989 reads as under: 
147. Income 
escaping 
assessment.—If 
the 
assessing officer has reason to believe that any 
income 
chargeable 
to 
tax 
has 
escaped 
assessment for any assessment year, he may, 
subject to the provisions of Sections 148 to 
153, assess or reassess such income and also 
any other income chargeable to tax which has 
escaped assessment and which comes to his 
notice subsequently in the course of the 
proceedings under this section, or recompute 
the loss or the depreciation allowance or any 
other allowance, as the case may be, for the 
assessment year concerned (hereafter in this 
section and in Sections 148 to 153 referred to 
as the relevant assessment year). 
 

32 
 
 
 
28.4.  
Thus, Section 147 as it stood at the relevant point of time 
provides that if the assessing officer has reason to believe that any 
income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any assessment 
year, he may assess or re-assess such income and such other income 
which has escaped assessment and which comes to his notice 
subsequently in the course of proceedings under Section 147. 
29. 
 
Section 148 says that before making an assessment, re-
assessment etc. under Section 147, the assessing officer is required to 
issue and serve a notice on the assessee calling upon the assessee to 
file a return of his income in the prescribed form etc., setting forth such 
particulars as may be called upon. 
30. 
 
Such a notice is subject to the time limit prescribed under 
Section 149. Under sub-Section (1)(b), no notice under Section 148 
shall be issued in a case where an assessment under sub-section (3) of 
Section 143 or Section 147 has been made for such assessment year if 
seven years but not more than 10 years have elapsed from the end of 
the relevant assessment year unless the income chargeable to tax which 
has escaped assessment amounts to or is likely to amount to Rs. 50,000 
or more for that year. 
31. 
 
At this stage, we deem it necessary to expound on the 
meaning of disclosure. As per the P. Ramanatha Aiyar, Advanced Law 
Lexicon, Volume 2, Edition 6, ‘to disclose’ is to expose to view or 

33 
 
 
 
knowledge, anything which before was secret, hidden or concealed. The 
word ‘disclosure’ means to disclose, reveal, unravel or bring to notice, 
vide CIT Vs. Bimal Kumar Damani, (2003) 261 ITR 87 (Cal). The word 
‘true’ qualifies a fact or averment as correct, exact, actual, genuine or 
honest. The word ‘full’ means complete. True disclosure of concealed 
income must relate to the assessee concerned. Full disclosure, in the 
context of financial documents, means that all material or significant 
information should be disclosed. Therefore, the meaning of ‘full and true 
disclosure’ is the voluntary filing of a return of income that the assessee 
earnestly believes to be true. Production of books of accounts or other 
material evidence that could ordinarily be discovered by the assessing 
officer does not amount to a true and full disclosure. 
32. 
 
Let us now discuss some of the judgments cited at the bar. 
First and foremost is the decision of a constitution bench of this Court 
in Calcutta Discount Company Limited (supra). That was a case under 
Section 34 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 which is in pari-materia 
to Section 147 of the Act. The constitution bench explained the purport 
of Section 34 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 and highlighted two 
conditions which would have to be satisfied before issuing a notice to 
reopen an assessment beyond four years but within eight years (as was 
the then limitation). The first condition was that the income tax officer 
must have reason to believe that income, profits or gains chargeable to 
income tax had been under-assessed. The second condition was that he 

34 
 
 
 
must have also reason to believe that such under-assessment had 
occurred by reason of either (i) omission or failure on the part of the 
assessee to make a return of his income under Section 22, or (ii) 
omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly 
all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year. It was 
emphasized that both these were conditions precedent to be satisfied 
before the income tax officer could have jurisdiction to issue a notice for 
the assessment or re-assessment beyond the period of four years but 
within the period of eight years from the end of the year in question. 
The words used in the expression “omission or failure to disclose fully 
and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year” 
would postulate a duty on every assessee to disclose fully and truly all 
material facts necessary for his assessment though what facts are 
material and necessary for assessment would differ from case to case. 
On the above basis, this Court came to the conclusion that while the 
duty of the assessee is to disclose fully and truly all primary facts, it 
does not extend beyond this. This position has been reiterated in 
subsequent decisions by this Court including in Income Tax Officer Vs. 
Lakhmani Mewal Das, 1976 (3) SCC 757; 1976 (103) ITR 437. The 
expression “reason to believe” has also been explained to mean reasons 
deducible from the materials on record and which have a live link to the 
formation of the belief that income chargeable to tax has escaped 
assessment. Such reasons must be based on material and specific 

35 
 
 
 
information obtained subsequently and not on the basis of surmises, 
conjectures or gossip. The reasons formed must be bona fide. 
33. 
 
In Phool Chand Bajrang Lal (supra), this Court examined the 
purport of Section 147 of the Act and observed that the object of Section 
147 is to ensure that a party cannot get away by willfully making a false 
or untrue statement at the time of original assessment and when that 
falsity comes to notice, to turn around and say “you accepted my lie, 
now your hands are tied and you can do nothing”. This Court opined 
that it would be a travesty of justice to allow an assessee such latitude. 
After adverting to various previous decisions, this Court held that an 
income tax officer acquires jurisdiction to reopen an assessment under 
Section 147(a) read with Section 148 of the Act only if on the basis of 
specific, reliable and relevant information coming to his possession 
subsequently, he has reasons, which he must record, to believe that 
due to omission or failure on the part of the assessee to make a true 
and full disclosure of all material facts necessary for his assessment 
during the concluded assessment proceedings, any part of his income, 
profit or gains chargeable to income tax has escaped assessment. In the 
above context, Supreme Court has held as under: 
25. …...He may start reassessment proceedings 
either because some fresh facts come to light 
which were not previously disclosed or some 
information with regard to the facts previously 
disclosed comes into his possession which 
tends to expose the untruthfulness of those 

36 
 
 
 
facts. In such situations, it is not a case of mere 
change of opinion or the drawing of a different 
inference from the same facts as were earlier 
available but acting on fresh information. Since, 
the belief is that of the Income Tax Officer, the 
sufficiency of reasons for forming the belief, is 
not for the Court to judge but it is open to an 
assessee to establish that there in fact existed 
no belief or that the belief was not at all a bona 
fide one or was based on vague, irrelevant and 
non-specific information. To that limited extent, 
the Court may look into the conclusion arrived 
at by the Income Tax Officer and examine 
whether there was any material available on the 
record from which the requisite belief could be 
formed by the Income Tax Officer and further 
whether 
that 
material 
had 
any 
rational 
connection or a live link for the formation of the 
requisite belief. It would be immaterial whether 
the Income Tax Officer at the time of making the 
original assessment could or, could not have 
found by further enquiry or investigation, 
whether the transaction was genuine or not, if 
on the basis of subsequent information, the 
Income Tax Officer arrives at a conclusion, after 
satisfying the twin conditions prescribed in 
Section 147(a) of the Act, that the assessee had 
not made a full and true disclosure of the 
material facts at the time of original assessment 
and therefore income chargeable to tax had 
escaped assessment.…… 
 
 
34. 
 
This Court in the case of Srikrishna Private Limited (supra) 
emphasized that what is required of an assessee in the course of 
assessment proceedings is a full and true disclosure of all material facts 
necessary for making assessment for that year. It was emphasized that 
it is the obligation of the assessee to disclose the material facts or what 
are called primary facts. It is not a mere disclosure but a disclosure 

37 
 
 
 
which is full and true. Referring to the decision in Phool Chand Bajrang 
Lal (supra), it has been highlighted that a false disclosure is not a true 
disclosure and would not satisfy the requirement of making a full and 
true disclosure. The obligation of the assessee to disclose the primary 
facts necessary for his assessment fully and truly can neither be ignored 
nor watered down. All the requirements stipulated by Section 147 must 
be given due and equal weight.  
35. 
 
Kelvinator of India Limited (supra) is a case where this Court 
examined the question as to whether the concept of “change of opinion” 
stands obliterated with effect from 01.04.1989 i.e. after substitution of 
Section 147 of the Act by the Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987. 
This Court considered the changes made in Section 147 and found that 
prior to the Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987, reopening could 
be done under two conditions i.e., (a) the Income Tax Officer had reason 
to believe that by reason of omission or failure on the part of the 
assessee to make a return under Section 139 for any assessment year 
or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his 
assessment for that year, income chargeable to tax had escaped 
assessment for that year, or (b) notwithstanding that there was no such 
omission or failure on the part of the assessee, the Income Tax Officer 
had in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe 
that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment for any 
assessment year. Fulfilment of the above two conditions alone conferred 

38 
 
 
 
jurisdiction on the assessing officer to make a re-assessment. But with 
effect from 01.04.1989, the above two conditions have been given a go-
by in Section 147 and only one condition has remained, viz, that where 
the assessing officer has reason to believe that income has escaped 
assessment, that would be enough to confer jurisdiction on the 
assessing officer to reopen the assessment. Therefore, post 01.04.1989, 
power to reopen assessment is much wider. However, this Court 
cautioned that one needs to give a schematic interpretation to the words 
“reason to believe”, otherwise Section 147 would give arbitrary powers 
to the assessing officer to reopen assessments on the basis of “mere 
change of opinion”, which cannot be per se reason to reopen.  
35.1.  
This Court also referred to Circular No.549 dated 
31.10.1989 of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to allay the 
apprehension that omission of the expression “reason to believe” from 
Section 147 and its substitution by the word “opinion” would give 
arbitrary powers to the assessing officer to reopen past assessments on 
mere change of opinion and pointed out that in 1989 Section 147 was 
once again amended to reintroduce the expression “has reason to 
believe” in place of the expression “for reasons to be recorded by him in 
writing, is of the opinion”. This Court thereafter explained as under: 
6. We must also keep in mind the conceptual 
difference between power to review and power 
to reassess. The assessing officer has no power 
to review; he has the power to reassess. But 

39 
 
 
 
reassessment has to be based on fulfilment of 
certain precondition and if the concept of 
“change of opinion” is removed, as contended 
on behalf of the Department, then, in the garb 
of reopening the assessment, review would take 
place. 
7. One must treat the concept of “change of 
opinion” as an in-built test to check abuse of 
power by the assessing officer. Hence, after 1-
4-1989, the assessing officer has power to 
reopen, provided there is “tangible material” to 
come 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
there 
is 
escapement of income from assessment. 
Reasons must have a live link with the 
formation of the belief. Our view gets support 
from the changes made to Section 147 of the 
Act, as quoted hereinabove. Under the Direct 
Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987, Parliament 
not only deleted the words “reason to believe” 
but also inserted the word “opinion” in Section 
147 of the Act. However, on receipt of 
representations from the companies against 
omission of the words “reason to believe”, 
Parliament reintroduced the said expression 
and deleted the word “opinion” on the ground 
that it would vest arbitrary powers in the 
assessing officer. 
 
36. 
 
Elaborating further on the expression “change of opinion”, 
this Court in Techspan India Private Limited (supra) observed that to 
check whether it is a case of change of opinion or not one would have 
to see its meaning in literal as well as legal terms. The expression 
“change of opinion” would imply formulation of opinion and then a 
change thereof. In terms of assessment proceedings, it means 
formulation of belief by the assessing officer resulting from what he 
thinks on a particular question. Therefore, before interfering with the 

40 
 
 
 
proposed reopening of the assessment on the ground that the same is 
based only on a change of opinion, the court ought to verify whether the 
assessment earlier made has either expressly or by necessary 
implication expressed an opinion on a matter which is the basis of the 
alleged escapement of income that was taxable. If the assessment order 
is non-speaking, cryptic or perfunctory in nature, it may be difficult to 
attribute to the assessing officer any opinion on the questions that are 
raised in the proposed reassessment proceedings.  
37.   
Learned counsel for the respondent has placed before the 
Court in the convenience compilation the reasons recorded by the 
assessing officer for initiating reassessment proceedings. The same is 
extracted as under: 
 
Reasons for the belief that income has escaped

As per the last balance sheet of the assessee for AY

capital of the assessee is as under:- 
 
Fixed capital of partners. 
 
Rs. 20,50,000/-

available. But the balance sheet/P&L a/c for AY 1993-
94 shows increase in capital which is as under: 
 
 
Fixed capital of partners. 
 
Rs. 20,50,000/- 

41 
 
 
 
Investment allowance.

The difference of Rs. 1,19,51,599/- is obviously the 
profit of the assessee during the AY 1990-91 to 1993-
94. The profit of AY 1993-94 as per the accounts is Rs. 
5,08,548/-. If this is excluded, the profit for the three 
years i.e. 1990-91, 1991-92 and AY 1992-93 is Rs. 
1,14,43,051/-. The profit will be more, if the drawings 
during the period of the partners are included. The 
drawings and taxes paid is:

Rs.20,30,584/-

1993-94 
(Figures not available

Rs.68,30,270/- 
Rs.3,83,925/- 
 
 
 
Thus, the profit for the three years would be Rs. 1,86, 
57, 246/- (1,14,43,051 + 68,30,270 + 3,83,925). Under 
assessment of income for the three years is, therefore, 
Rs.1,69,92,728 i.e., (18657246 – 1664518).    
                                                                                             
The sales estimated by AO for each of the 3 years less 
depreciation for each year is taken as the basis for 
determining the proportion in which the under-
assessment has been made.

In view of the above, I have reason to believe that by 
reason of omission or failure on the part of the assessee 
to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary 
for his assessment, income as determined above, 
chargeable to tax has escaped assessment. 
 
38. 
 
Thus, from a reading of the reasons recorded by the 
assessing officer leading to formation of his belief that income of the 
assessee had escaped assessment for the assessment years under 
consideration, it is seen that the only material which came into 
possession of the assessing officer subsequently was the balance sheet 
of the assessee for the assessment year 1989-90 obtained from the 
South Indian Bank. After obtaining this balance sheet, the assessing 
officer compared the same with the balance sheet and profit loss 
account of the assessee for the assessment year 1993-94. On such 
comparison, the assessing officer noticed significant increase in the 
current and capital accounts of the partners of the assessee. On that 
basis, he drew the inference that profit of the assessee for the three 
assessment years under consideration would be significantly higher 
which had escaped assessment. The figure of under assessment was 
quantified at Rs.1,69,92,728.00. Therefore, he recorded that he had 
reason to believe that due to omission or failure on the part of the 
assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the 
assessments, incomes chargeable to tax for the three assessment years 
had escaped assessment. 

43 
 
 
 
39. 
 
Assessee did not submit regular balance sheet and profit 
and loss account for the three assessment years under consideration 
on the ground that books of account and other materials/documents of 
the assessee were seized by the department in the course of search and 
seizure operation which were not yet returned to the assessee. In the 
absence of such books etc., it became difficult for the assessee to 
maintain yearwise regular books of account etc. However, regular books 
of account and profit and loss account were filed by the assessee along 
with the return of income for the assessment year 1993-94. What the 
assessing officer did was to cull out the figures discernible from the 
balance sheet for the assessment year 1989-90 obtained from the South 
Indian Bank and compared the same with the balance sheet submitted 
by the assessee before the assessing officer for the assessment year 
1993-94 and thereafter arrived at the aforesaid conclusion. 
40. 
 
It may be mentioned that the assessee had filed its regular 
balance sheet as on 31.12.1985 while filing the return of income for the 
assessment year 1986-87. The next balance sheet filed was as on 
31.03.1993 for the assessment year 1993-94. No balance sheet was 
filed in the interregnum as according to the assessee, it could not 
maintain proper books of account as the relevant materials were seized 
by the department in the course of a search and seizure operation and 
not yet returned. It was not possible for it to obtain ledger balances to 
be brought down for the succeeding accounting years. As regards the 

44 
 
 
 
balance sheet as on 31.03.1989 filed by the assessee before the South 
Indian Bank and which was construed by the assessing officer to be the 
balance sheet of the assessee for the assessment year 1989-90, the 
explanation of the assessee was that it was prepared on provisional and 
estimate basis and was submitted before the South Indian Bank for 
obtaining credit and therefore could not be relied upon in assessment 
proceedings. It appears that this balance sheet was also relied upon by 
the assessing officer in the re-assessment proceedings of the assessee 
for the assessment year 1989-90. In the first appellate proceedings, 
CIT(A) in its appellate order dated 26.03.2002 held that such profit and 
loss account and the balance sheet furnished to the South Indian Bank 
were not reliable and had discarded the same. That being the position, 
the assessing officer could not have placed reliance on such balance 
sheet submitted by the assessee allegedly for the assessment year 
1989-90 to the South Indian Bank for obtaining credit. Dehors such 
balance sheet, there were no other material in the possession of the 
assessing officer to come to the conclusion that income of the assessee 
for the three assessment years had escaped assessment. 
41. 
 
It is true that Section 139 places an obligation upon every 
person to furnish voluntarily a return of his total income if such income 
during the previous year exceeded the maximum amount which is not 
chargeable to income tax. The assessee is under further obligation to 
disclose all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year 

45 
 
 
 
fully and truly. However, as has been held by the constitution bench of 
this Court in Calcutta Discount Company Limited (supra), while the duty 
of the assessee is to disclose fully and truly all primary and relevant 
facts necessary for assessment, it does not extend beyond this. Once 
the primary facts are disclosed by the assessee, the burden shifts onto 
the assessing officer.  It is not the case of the revenue that the assessee 
had made a false declaration. On the basis of the “balance sheet” 
submitted by the assessee before the South Indian Bank for obtaining 
credit which was discarded by the CIT(A) in an earlier appellate 
proceeding of the assessee itself, the assessing officer upon a 
comparison of the same with a subsequent balance sheet of the 
assessee for the assessment year 1993-94 which was filed by the 
assessee and was on record, erroneously concluded that there was 
escapement of income and initiated reassessment proceedings. 
 
42. 
 
We may also mention that while framing the initial 
assessment orders of the assessee for the three assessment years in 
question, the assessing officer had made an independent analysis of the 
incomings and outgoings of the assessee for the relevant previous years 
and thereafter had passed the assessment orders under Section 143(3) 
of the Act. We have already taken note of the fact that an assessment 
order under Section 143(3) is preceded by notice, enquiry and hearing 
under Section 142(1), (2) and (3) as well as under Section 143(2). If that 

46 
 
 
 
be the position and when the assessee had not made any false 
declaration, it was nothing but a subsequent subjective analysis of the 
assessing officer that income of the assessee for the three assessment 
years was much higher than what was assessed and therefore, had 
escaped assessment. This is nothing but a mere change of opinion 
which cannot be a ground for reopening of assessment. 
 
43. 
 
There is one more aspect which we may mention. 
Admittedly, the returns for the three assessment years under 
consideration were not accompanied by the regular books of account. 
Though under sub-section (9)(f) of Section 139, such returns could have 
been treated as defective returns by the assessing officer and the 
assessee intimated to remove the defect failing which the returns would 
have been invalid, however, the materials on record do not indicate that 
the assessing officer had issued any notice to the assessee bringing to 
its notice such defect and calling upon the assessee to rectify the defect 
within the period as provided under the aforesaid provision. In other 
words, the assessing officer had accepted the returns submitted by the 
assessee for the three assessment years under question. At this stage, 
we may also mention that it is the case of the assessee that though it 
could not maintain and file regular books of account with the returns 
in the assessment proceedings for the three assessment years under 
consideration, nonetheless it had prepared and filed the details of 

47 
 
 
 
accounts as well as incomings and outgoings of the assessee etc. for 
each of the three assessment years which were duly verified and 
enquired into by the assessing officer in the course of the assessment 
proceedings which culminated in the orders of assessment under sub-
section (3) of Section 143. Suffice it to say that a return filed without 
the regular balance sheet and profit and loss account may be a defective 
one but certainly not invalid. A defective return cannot be regarded as 
an invalid return. The assessing officer has the discretion to intimate 
the assessee about the defect(s) and it is only when the defect(s) are not 
rectified within the specified period that the assessing officer may treat 
the return as an invalid return. Ascertaining the defects and intimating 
the same to the assessee for rectification, are within the realm of 
discretion of the assessing officer. It is for him to exercise the discretion. 
The burden is on the assessing officer. If he does not exercise the 
discretion, the return of income cannot be construed as a defective 
return. As a matter of fact, in none of the three assessment years, the 
assessing officer had issued any declaration that the returns were 
defective. 
 
44. 
 
Assessee has asserted both in the pleadings and in the oral 
hearing that though it could not file regular books of account along with 
the returns for the three assessment years under consideration because 
of seizure by the department, nonetheless the returns of income were 

48 
 
 
 
accompanied by tentative profit and loss account and other details of 
income like cash flow statements, statements showing the source and 
application of funds reflecting the increase in the capital and current 
accounts of the partners of the assessee etc., which were duly enquired 
into by the assessing officer in the assessment proceedings.  
45. 
 
Thus, having regard to the discussions made above, we are 
therefore of the view that the Tribunal was justified in coming to the 
conclusion that the reassessments for the three assessment years 
under consideration were not justified. The High Court has erred in 
reversing such findings of the Tribunal. Consequently, we set aside the 
common order of the High Court dated 12.09.2009 and restore the 
common order of the Tribunal dated 29.10.2004. 
46. 
 
The above conclusions reached by us would cover the other 
civil appeals of this batch as well. Resultantly, all the civil appeals filed 
by the assessee and its partners are hereby allowed. No costs.
