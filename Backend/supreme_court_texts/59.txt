PETITION FOR SPECIAL LEAVE TO APPEAL (C) NO.11258/2015
OMDEO BALIRAM MUSALE & ORS.                        PETITIONER(S)
                                VERSUS
PRAKASH RAMCHANDRA MAMIDWAR  & ORS.                RESPONDENT(S)
O R D E R
1.
This Special Leave Petition is against the decision of the
High Court1 in dismissing an application for restoration of a Civil
Revision  Application  and  the  accompanying  application  for
condonation  of  delay  in  sheer  exasperation.   The  facts  are  as
follows:
2.
A simple prayer was made by the petitioners in a suit for
declaration that the property belonging to the joint family, but
their father wrongly sold it to third parties through a sale deed
in the year 1980.  
3.
The suit came to be dismissed for default for not paying the
process fee for service of notice on the LRs. of defendant no.2.
The petitioners therefore filed an application for restoration in
1993.
1 In CA No. 1109/2013 in MCA No. 12275/2013 in CRA No. 284/2003 dated 05.11.2014.

4.
This application for restoration was decided after seven years
and the Trial Court on 04.02.2000 dismissed the application on the
ground that it was filed under Order IX Rule 9 of the CPC whereas
it ought to have been filed under Order IX Rule 4 of the CPC as the
suit was originally dismissed under Order IX, Rule 2 of the CPC.
The petitioner filed an appeal against this order.
5.
After  three  years,  the  appeal  came  to  be  dismissed  on
25.06.2003.  The petitioner then filed a revision petition in which
the High Court issued notice.
6.
While  the  revision  was  pending  before  the  High  Court,  the
petitioner was unable to serve respondent no.8 for a long time due
to some issue about change in the names. Having waited for long,
High  Court  passed  a  peremptory  order  on  01.12.2005  that  if  the
objections  were  not  removed  within  a  period  of  two  weeks,  the
revision petition would stand dismissed without reference to the
Court.
7.
On  12.12.2005,  the  petitioner’s  advocate  is  said  to  have
prepared an application for change of name of respondent no.8 and a
copy  was  also  served  on  the  respondent’s  advocate  but  in  the
meanwhile the peremptory order came into operation and the revision
petition came to be dismissed on 15.12.2005.
8.
Despite the dismissal of the revision petition, the petitioner
filed  the  application  for  change  in  name  of  respondent  no.8  on
21.12.2005.

9.
The sad story continues. In 2011, i.e. after six years, an
M.A. for restoration was filed by the petitioner through his son.
The son’s affidavit was taken on record. However, the High Court by
order dated 03.07.2013 dismissed the M.A. only on the ground that
it was not moved by the original party to the revision petition.
10.
In view of the above referred order, another application was
filed  in  2013  by  the  petitioner  himself  for  restoration  of  the
revision petition and condonation of delay. The High Court by the
order dated 05.11.2014, impugned herein, dismissed the application
for restoration.
11.
The story does not stop here.  The petitioner then filed a
Special Leave Petition against the above-said impugned order and
notice was issued by this Court on 06.04.2015. 
12.
From  2015,  the  matter  has  been  pending  before  this  Court.
Proceedings in the case indicate that the SLP was listed several
times between 2015 and 2024 but could not be heard as notice on
some respondents was not complete.  
13.
The above referred facts indicate that the suit that was filed
in 1982 never took off as even summons were not issued. It might
not be surprising for lawyers, judges and those who are acquainted
with civil court proceedings. The real danger is when we accept
this position and continue with it as part of a systematic problem.
Until and unless we believe that this situation is unacceptable and
act accordingly, the power, authority and jurisdiction of Courts to
address simple reliefs of citizens will be consumed and destroyed
by passage of time. This is not acceptable at all.

14.
There must be a solution, idea and resolve to rectify this
situation  and  ensure  that  simple,  quick  and  easy  remedies  are
available to correct an illegality for a rightful restitution.  We
have referred to all this only to take note of what has happened
and take steps to rectify it in the time to come.  
15.
Coming back to this case, we have noticed that the suit that
was filed in the year 1982 relates to an alleged unauthorized sale
by  father  more  than  four  decades  back.  The  suit  has  virtually
become  infructuous  for  more  than  one  reason.  The  Special  Leave
Petition is dismissed.
16.
Pending application(s) shall also stand disposed of.
