Union of India

FACTUAL ASPECTS
1.
The respondent no.1 is 100 per cent visually impaired.
He appeared in the Civil Services Examination, 2008 (CSE-
2008).  Respondent no.1 gave four preferences for services in
the  following  order:  Indian  Administrative  Services  (IAS),
Indian  Revenue  Services-Income  Tax  (IRS  (IT)),  Indian
Railway Personnel Service (IRPS) and Indian Revenue Service
(Customs and Excise) (IRS (C&E)).  After having undergone
the  written  test  and  interview,  he  was  denied  an
appointment. 
2.
Therefore,  the  respondent  no.1  filed  the  Original
Application  no.2402  of  2009  before  the  Central
Administrative  Tribunal,  New  Delhi  (for  short,  ‘the  CAT’).
The argument before the CAT, inter alia, was that the backlog

vacancies in accordance with the provisions of the Persons
with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights
and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (for short, ‘the PWD Act,
1995’) were not filled in.  By the judgment dated 8th October
2010  of  the  CAT,  the  Union  Public  Service  Commission
(UPSC)  and  the  Department  of  Personnel  and  Training
(DoPT)  were  directed  to  calculate  the  backlog  vacancies
following the mandate of the PWD Act, 1995.  A time of six
months was granted to do the exercise.  A direction was
issued to the appellant-Union of India, to inform respondent
no.1, if service could be allocated to him.  Pursuant to the
said  order,  on  9th September  2011,  the  UPSC  informed
respondent no.1 that his name did not figure in the merit list
of CSE-2008 within the number of available vacancies for the
PH-2 (Visually Impaired-VI) category.  That led to respondent
no.1  filing  another  Original  Application  no.3493  of  2011
before the CAT.  By the judgment dated 30th May 2012, the
CAT  issued  a  direction  to  the  UPSC  that  the  candidates
selected  on  their  own  merits  must  be  adjusted  in  the
unreserved/general category in accordance with the Office
Memorandum dated 29th December 2005.  A direction was
issued that the candidates belonging to the VI category must
be selected against the reserved category and be given  an
appointment.  Unfortunately, on 30th August 2012, the UPSC
informed  respondent  no.1  that  he  was  not  qualified  for
appointment in the PH-2 (VI) quota.  The appellant-Union of
India, challenged the judgment dated 30th May 2012 by filing
   Civil Appeal No.3303 of 2015
Page 2 of 12

a writ petition before the Delhi High Court.  By the impugned
judgment  dated  11th October  2013,  the  writ  petition  was
dismissed, and that is how the appellant-Union of India is in
appeal.
3.
As  noted  earlier,  the  UPSC,  by  the  communication
dated 30th  August 2012, informed  respondent no.1 that he
could not be selected against the PH-2 (VI) quota.  He filed a
review application before the CAT by pointing out that many
vacancies  available  for  VI  category  candidates  remained
unfilled, against which he was entitled to the appointment.
As the review application was rejected, respondent no.1 has
filed a writ petition, which is pending before the High Court
of Delhi.
4.
It must be noted that the connected appeals/petitions
were filed along with this appeal, in which several orders
were  passed  by  this  Court  from  time  to  time,  from  1st
February 2022.  Based on the same principles adopted in the
impugned judgment, some other candidates belonging to the
PWD  category  were  granted  appointments,  and  therefore,
companion appeals/petitions were disposed of.  
5.
Now, coming to the case of respondent no.1, a detailed
order was passed by this Court on 31st August 2023, which
reads thus:
“As  far  as  the  challenge  on  merits  is
concerned, it is academic in the sense that
the matter has travelled further and in fact
an attempt has been made by the Union of
   Civil Appeal No.3303 of 2015
Page 3 of 12

India to place on record material to show
that  the  direction  of  the  Administrative
Tribunal  which  was 
subject  matter  of
challenge before the High Court has been
complied with.
This is a case where admittedly the Union of
India did not give effect to the reservations
under the Persons with Disabilities (Equal
Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full
Participation)  Act,  1995  (for  short,  “the
1995 Act”) in the civil services right from
1996 till 2009. Therefore, there were many
litigations  filed  by  the  persons  with
disabilities. We are concerned with persons
who  are  Visually  Impaired  (VI). 
In  the
additional  affidavit  filed  by  the  Union  of
India dated 29.04.2022, it is contended that
there  were  41  backlog vacancies of the
period from 1996 to 2009 out of which 20
were of the category LDCP, 5 of VI and 16 of
HI. The contention of the Union of India is
that categories of IRS (C&CE) and IRS (IT)
were excluded from the reservation under
Section 33 of the 1995 Act for the category
of VI. However, we find that a notification
excluding  these  two  categories  for  VI
category in terms of proviso to Section 33
of  the  1995  Act  has  not  been  placed  on
record. 
Therefore,  in  absence  of  a
notification under proviso to Section 33, the
reservation will have to be provided to VIs
in these two categories as well.
The  submission  of  the  learned  counsel
appearing for the first respondent on the
basis of documents on record is that if the
reservation  against  these  two posts (IRS
[C&CE]) and (IRS [IT]) for category of VI is
provided, the total backlog will be at least
17. Therefore,  his  contention  is  that  the
   Civil Appeal No.3303 of 2015
Page 4 of 12

first respondent who belongs to VI category
and 10 others in the same category who
are above him in the order of merit can be
accommodated in terms of the order of the
Tribunal.
We, therefore, direct the Union of India to
redo  the  exercise 
of  ascertaining  the
backlog vacancies for visually impaired.
There is one more aspect of the matter. If
there are 17 backlog vacancies as claimed
by learned counsel appearing for the first
respondent, the issue of first respondent
can get resolved. We find from the affidavit
referred  above  that  out  of  41  backlog
vacancies, 
only 
22 
were 
filled 
in.
Therefore, 19 vacancies remain. Therefore,
we direct the Union of India to also consider
of allowing interchange as contemplated by
Section 36 of the 1995 Act.
We are conscious of the fact that the first
respondent  has  already  approached  the
High Court. However, we are dealing with a
very  peculiar  situation  arising  due to  the
failure of the Union of India to give effect to
the reservation under  Section  33  of  the
1995 Act for such a long time.
We direct the Union of India to undertake
the aforesaid exercise on both counts by the
end of October, 2023. After completing the
aforesaid  exercise, an affidavit shall be
filed by the Union  of  India  giving  all
particulates and necessary documents.
If the  Union of India  finds that  by  doing
exercise  of  interchange,  if  the  first
respondent and the candidates above him
could be accommodated, the Union of India
is free to do that.

The appellant, the Union of India, filed an additional
affidavit dated 9th January 2024 reporting compliance with
the said order.  
SUBMISSIONS
7.
The submission of the learned counsel appearing for
the appellant is that even after undertaking exercise in terms
of the order dated 31st August 2023, respondent no.1 cannot
be accommodated  for  the  reasons  set  out  in  the  affidavit
dated  9th  January  2024  filed  by  Mr Sanjay  Kumar
Chaurasia, Under Secretary to the Government of India in
the DoPT.  
8.
The  submission  of  the  learned  counsel  representing
respondent no.1 is that for accommodating respondent no.1,
the backlog of vacancies must be calculated for the period of
1996 to 2008.  No exemption under Section 33 of the PWD
Act,  1995  was  granted to  All  India  Civil Services/Central
Services for which recruitment is conducted by the UPSC.  It
is  pointed  out  that  there  are  a  large  number  of  backlog
vacancies.  It is also pointed out that in 2008, at least 42
vacancies  were  available  for  VI  category  candidates.
Therefore,  respondent  no.1  should have  been  appointed
against the available vacancies in services.  It was submitted
that  availing  the  facility  of  a  scribe  for  taking  the  Civil
Services Examination does not take away a candidate’s right
to compete in an unreserved category.  It is pointed out that
   Civil Appeal No.3303 of 2015
Page 6 of 12

that is the finding recorded by the CAT and the High Court in
the impugned judgments. The learned counsel appearing for
the first respondent submitted that  enough  vacancies  are
available to accommodate the first respondent. 
CONSIDERATION
9.
We are conscious of the fact that a writ petition filed by
respondent no.1 is pending before the High Court of Delhi.
In this case, the affidavits filed by the appellant-Union of
India bring a sorry state of affairs on record. The appellant
failed to implement the provisions of the PWD Act, 1995.
That is the specific finding recorded in paragraph 17 of the
impugned judgment of the High Court.  Respondent no.1 has
been made to run from pillar to post to get an appointment,
though there is a large backlog of vacancies in various PWD
categories.  Therefore, relegating respondent no.1 to the High
Court will be unjust.  He has been fighting for justice from
the year 2009.
10.
In the order dated 31st August 2023, we have referred to
the additional  affidavit  dated  29th April  2022 filed by the
appellant-Union of India, in which it was stated that there
were 41 backlog vacancies for the period from 1996 to 2009,
out of which, 20 were of the category of Locomotor Disability
or Cerebral Palsy (LDCP), 5 of Visual Impairment (VI) and 16
of Hearing Impairment (HI).  This Court has noted that the
appellant took a stand that the IRS (C&E) and IRS (IT) posts
were excluded from the reservation under Section 33 of the
   Civil Appeal No.3303 of 2015
Page 7 of 12

PWD  Act,  1995,  for  the  VI  category.   There  is  already  a
finding recorded by this Court that a notification excluding
these two categories for VI category candidates has not been
issued in terms of the proviso to Section 33 of the PWD Act,
1995.  Therefore, this Court held in the said order that in
absence of such a notification, the reservation will have to be
provided to the VI category candidates in these two categories
as well.  This Court also recorded in the order dated 31st
August 2023 that if there were 17 backlog vacancies, the
issue of respondent no.1 could be resolved.  This Court noted
that, as stated in the appellant's affidavit of 29th April 2022,
19 backlog vacancies remained.  Therefore, a direction was
issued  by  this  Court  to  the  appellant-Union  of  India,  to
consider allowing interchange as contemplated by Section 36
of the PWD Act,1995.  
11.
Therefore, the  appellant's response to the order dated
31st August  2023,  in  the  form  of  an  affidavit  dated  9th
January 2024, will have to be carefully examined.  While we
examine the said response, we must note that the UPSC, vide
its letter dated 29th April 2022, has accepted that respondent
no.1 was ranked 11 after the last recommended candidate of
the PH-2 (VI) category.  In the background of this position, we
analyse  the  stand  taken  by  the  appellant  in  the  affidavit
dated 9th January 2024.  A stand has been taken that in the
meeting held on 23rd November 2017, a recommendation was
made  that  the  vacancies  cannot  be  reserved  for  the  VI
category in IRS (IT) and IRS (C&E).  
   Civil Appeal No.3303 of 2015
Page 8 of 12

12.
Section 33 of the PWD Act, 1995 reads thus:
“33.  Reservation  of  Posts  - 
Every
appropriate  Government  shall  appoint  in
every  establishment  such  percentage  of
vacancies not less than three per cent. for
persons or class of persons with disability
of  which  one  per  cent.  each  shall  be
reserved for persons suffering from-
i. blindness or low vision; 
ii. hearing impairment; 
iii. locomotor disability or cerebral palsy, in
the posts identified for each disability: 
Provided
 
that
 
the
 
appropriate
Government  may,  having  regard  to  the
type  of  work  carried  on  in  any
department  or  establishment,  by
notification subject to such conditions, if
any,  as  may  be  specified  in  such
notification,  exempt  any  establishment
from the provisions of this section.”
(emphasis added)
13.
Even in this affidavit, the appellant-Union of India, has
not come up with the stand that an exemption notification
was issued in terms of the proviso to Section 33 of the PWD
Act, 1995.  A stand has been taken based on a subsequent
Office  Memorandum  dated  6th November  2023  that  the
exemption notification is required to be issued only when
none of the categories of persons with disability have been
found suitable for a post/service.  Therefore, it is pointed out
that in the case of IRS (IT) and IRS (C&E), a notification of
exemption was not required as the reservation was provided
   Civil Appeal No.3303 of 2015
Page 9 of 12

to  persons  with locomotor  and  hearing  disabilities.   The
appellant-Union of India has expressed its inability to pass an
order of exchange under Section 36 of the PWD Act, 1995.  A
stand has been taken that there was no non-merit candidate
in the VI category from CSE-2006 to 2008.
14.
In the said affidavit, the vacancy statement for CSE-
1996 to CSE-2017 has been incorporated, which reads thus:
“.. .. … .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
The  details  of  vacancies  for  CSE-1996  to
CSE-2017  in  respect  of  IRS(IT)  and
IRS(C&CE)  as  provided  by  the  CCA
concerned and as already submitted before
this Hon'ble Court are as under:
Indian  Revenue  Service  (Income  Tax)-
IRS(IT)
Total vacancy from 1996 to 2017:- 2469
Total Vacancy of PwD:- 75
Division of PwD:
LD (Locomotor Disability):-35
HI (Hearing Impairment):-33
VI (Visual Impairment)-:7
The Visually Impaired candidates were held
to  be  not  suitable  for  this  service  up  to
CSE-2013 according to the decision taken
in the Meeting  of 23.11.2007.  Therefore,
the  IRS  (IT)  started  taking  VI  candidates
from CSE-2014 onwards.

Central Excise)
Total vacancy from 1996 to 2017- 2048

HI (Hearing Impairment)-29
VI (Visual Impairment)-Exempted
The Visually Impaired candidates were held
to be not suitable for this service according
to  decision  taken  in  the  Meeting  of
23.11.2007.
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. … .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..”
Thus, several backlog vacancies exist for VI categories in IRS
(IT).   It  is  accepted  that  from  CSE-2014,  VI  category
candidates  are being selected for IRS (IT).  Thus, the total
vacancies of PWD posts for IRS (IT) are 75.  By applying the
principles governing Section 36 of the PWD Act, 1995, the
cases of respondent no.1 and the other 10 candidates who
are above him in merit could have been considered, especially
when there is a gross default on the part of the appellant-
Union of India in promptly implementing the provisions of
the PWD Act, 1995. Unfortunately, in this case, at all stages,
the appellant has taken a stand which defeats the very object
of enacting laws for the benefit of persons with disability. If
the appellant had implemented the PWD Act,1995, in its true
letter and spirit, respondent no.1 would not have been forced
to run from pillar to post to get justice.
15.
Therefore, this is a fit case to exercise the jurisdiction of
this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India by
issuing the following directions:
a. The cases of respondent no.1 and the other 10
candidates belonging to the VI category who are
   Civil Appeal No.3303 of 2015
Page 11 of 12

above him in the merit list of CSE-2008 shall be
considered for appointment against the backlog
vacancies of PWD candidates either in IRS (IT) or
in other service/branch;
b. Necessary action of giving appointments shall be
taken within a period of three months from today.
The appointments will be made prospectively. The
appointees will not be entitled to the arrears of
salary and the benefit of seniority, etc.;
c. Only for the purposes of retirement benefits, their
services shall be counted from the date on which
the last candidate of the VI category in CSE-2008
was given an appointment;  
d. We make it clear that these directions have been
issued as a one-time measure in  the exercise of
the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 142 of
the Constitution of India, and the same shall not
be treated as a precedent and 
e. The  appeal  is  disposed  of  with  the  above
directions.
