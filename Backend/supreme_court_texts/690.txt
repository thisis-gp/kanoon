who was the export executive of the said company, Mehul 
Jhaveri, paid a sum of Rs.58,000/- to accused Chandubhai 
Kalal for clearing refund claim of Rs.46,87,000/- of the 
Company’s clients. Money was paid to Chandubhai Kalal by 
Mehul Jhaveri through Tushar Vaghela on 19th July 2010 in 
consideration of clearing three pending refund cases of the 
company’s clients. 
3. 
The allegation is that the respondent was the Managing 
Director of the company since 1998-99, and accused no.6-
Dushyant Mulani was one of the Directors of the company. The 
allegation is that accused no.1-Mehul Jhaveri was the 
company's regional head looking after CFIA work. Accused 
no.3-Tushar Vaghela, was working under the said Mehul 
Jhaveri. It is alleged that the amount of Rs.58,000/- represents 
1.25% of the total refund cleared by accused Chandubhai 
Kalal. The allegation regarding the payment/acceptance of a 
bribe of Rs.58,000/- is confined to Mehul Jhaveri, Chandubhai 
Kalal and Tushar Vaghela.  
4. 
Another allegation in the charge sheet pertains to the 
payment of illegal gratification to one Anand Singh Mall, posted 
as an Assistant Commissioner, Air Cargo at Ahmedabad from 
8th December 2009 till 1st March 2011. The said Anand Singh 
Mall was looking after the export, import and refund work. It 
was his duty to sanction Special Additional Duty (SAD) refund 
claims and to make payment thereof. The allegation in the 

 
 
 Criminal Appeal No. 3863 of 2024 
 
Page 3 of 8 
 
charge sheet is regarding the payment of Rs.3,50,000/- to 
Anand Singh Mall. The allegation is that Anand Singh Mall 
required a sum of Rs.3,50,000/- to be paid in Delhi. The case 
is that one R.C. Pagaria, in charge of the company in Delhi, 
received the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- through M/s Poornima 
Angadiya from the company’s head office in Mumbai. As per 
the instructions of Mehul Jhaveri, R.C. Pagaria paid a sum of 
Rs.3,50,000/- to one Kishan Rajwar who received it on behalf 
of Anand Singh Mall. 
5. 
Another allegation is that on 21st October 2010, the said 
Mehul Jhaveri informed accused no.6-Dushyant Mulani that 
he had sent a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- to the respondent, which 
has been handed over to Anand Singh Mall. The allegation in 
the charge sheet is that Mehul Jhaveri instructed Dushyant 
Mulani to inform one D.B. Jhadav as Anand Singh Mall was 
likely to contact the said Jadhav. Accordingly, there was a 
telephone conversation between Anand Singh Mall and Jadhav. 
It is alleged that the sum of Rs.1,50,000/- was paid as illegal 
gratification to Anand Singh Mall by Jhadav. According to the 
case of the prosecution, in the expenditure notebook 
maintained by Mehul Jhaveri, entries were made showing a 
sum of Rs.3,50,000/- against Anand Singh Mall. In the same 
notebook, there is an entry of payment of Rs.1,50,000/- to the 
respondent.  
6. 
The charge sheet was filed on 28th September 2012. On 
8th July 2016, the learned Special Judge under the PC Act 
rejected the application for discharge made by the respondent.

On 29th November 2017, the High Court allowed the Revision 
Application filed by the respondent and passed an order of 
discharge. On 20th August 2019, this Court passed an order of 
remand to the High Court on the ground that the High Court 
did not analyse factual aspects. After the order of remand, by 
the impugned order dated 14th February 2020, the High Court 
has again passed an order of discharge.  
SUBMISSIONS 
7. 
The Learned Additional Solicitor General has taken us 
through the relevant parts of the charge sheet and the 
impugned judgment. Her submission is that, at the time of 
framing of charge, the Court is not expected to examine and 
assess the material placed before it in detail. It must examine 
the material only to ascertain whether a prima facie case of 
commission of offences alleged has been made out against the 
accused. She submitted that the main allegation in the charge 
sheet against the respondent was of involvement in the 
conspiracy. When the amounts of Rs.3,50,000/- and 
Rs.1,50,000/-, respectively, were paid to Anand Singh Mall, the 
respondent was the company's Managing Director. The amount 
was paid on behalf of the company. She submitted that the 
High Court should not have discarded the intercepted 
conversation at this stage. She submits that a prima facie case 
was made out to proceed against the respondent.  
8. 
Learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent 
supported the impugned order. He submitted that the 
respondent is not a party to any telephonic conversation with 

 
 
 Criminal Appeal No. 3863 of 2024 
 
Page 5 of 8 
 
Mehul Jhaveri or any other accused. He pointed out that in the 
reply filed to the discharge application, the appellant stated 
that the letters DM in the notebook maintained by Mehul 
Jhaveri refer to Dushyant Mulani, who is a co-accused and not 
to the respondent. The reference to DM appears in the same 
notebook against the entry of a sum of Rs.1,50,000/-. He 
submitted that the notebook does not contain entries made or 
maintained by the respondent. He would submit that there is 
no reason to disturb a very well-reasoned decision of the High 
Court, which considers all the relevant material on the record 
of the charge sheet. He submitted that the High Court had 
examined the charge sheet only to ascertain whether there was 
any prima facie case against the respondent and that the High 
Court had not crossed the limit. 
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS 
9. 
We have perused the charge sheet and other material on 
record. A perusal of the charge sheet shows that the allegation 
is about payment of illegal gratification of Rs.58,000/-, 
Rs.3,50,000/- and Rs.1,50,000/- respectively, on behalf of the 
said company to officials of the customs department to procure 
benefits to its customers. As regards the allegation regarding 
the payment of Rs.58,000/-, the case is that accused no.1-
Mehul Jhaveri paid the said amount to another accused, 
Chandubhai Kalal. The charge sheet contains no allegation 
against the respondent to connect him with the payment. The 
allegations of being part of a criminal conspiracy are made 
against the respondent. As regards payment of illegal 
gratification of Rs.3,50,000/- and Rs.1,50,000/- respectively 

 
 
 Criminal Appeal No. 3863 of 2024 
 
Page 6 of 8 
 
paid to Anand Singh Mall, in the charge sheet, the allegation 
against the respondent is that the respondent in conspiracy 
with Mehul Jhaveri abetted the offence of bribery and arranged 
for payment of illegal gratification of Rs.3,50,000/- to Anand 
Singh Mall at Delhi through one Kishan Rajwar, who happens 
to be the respondent's nephew. Further allegation is that Mehul 
Jhaveri, in conspiracy with the respondent and one Dushyant 
Mulani, arranged to deliver illegal gratification of Rs.1,50,000/- 
to Anand Singh Mall in Mumbai.  
10. 
The prosecution is not relying upon any telephonic 
conversation between the respondent and any of the co-
accused or the person to whom illegal gratification was 
allegedly paid. In the charge sheet, as regards payment of the 
sum of Rs.3,50,000/- it is stated thus: 
“From the above facts it can be safely inferred that 
on 29.07.10. Shri Jhaveri had sent Rs.3,50,000/- 
to his Mumbai office for effecting payment to Anand 
Mall at Mumbai. But as Shri Anand Mall wanted the 
delivery of the amount at Delhi while discussing 
with Shri Jhaveri on 31.08.10, Shri Jhaveri made 
the arrangement for delivery of Rs.3.5 lakh through 
Shri R.C.Pagaria. On 31.08.10, as per the 
conspiracy hatached between Mehool Jhaveri and 
Shri Anand Singh Mall, as per the direction of Shri 
mall, Shri R.C.Pagaria paid Rs.3.5 lakhs to Shri 
Kishan Rajawar, nephew of Shri Anand Singh Mall. 
Further, on the same day evening ie., on 31.08.10, 
Shri R.C.Pagaria during conversation with Shri 
mehool Jhaveri confirmed about delivery to Shri 
Kishan @ Chota Kishan. The above facts put 
together shows that the word “Parking’ in the 
conversations pertains to delivery of money.”  

 
 
 Criminal Appeal No. 3863 of 2024 
 
Page 7 of 8 
 
11. 
Regarding payment of Rs.1,50,000/-, the allegation is 
that Mehul Jhaveri informed Dushyant Mulani that he had 
sent a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- to the respondent to be handed 
over to the said Anand Singh Mall. The prosecution is relying 
upon entries made by Mehul Jhaveri in his diary. The entry 
dated 29th July 2010 shows that the respondent's name is at 
the top of the page. It is recorded that “A Mall – ad-hoc as per 
the list attached show to DM – Rs.3,50,000/-”. It must be noted 
here that in the reply submitted by the appellant to the 
application for discharge, it is stated that the letters ‘DM’ stand 
for Dushant Bhai Mulani and not Dilip Mulani (respondent) 
12. 
Regarding payment of Rs.1,50,000/- to Anand Singh 
Mall, the diary maintained by the accused no.1 shows that 
there is an entry “Anand Mangal – trans to DM @ APO – 
Rs.1,50,000/-”. Thus, in this entry, the reference is also to 
Dushyant Mulani. 
13. 
The High Court has elaborately dealt with this material. 
The High Court has examined the statements of the witnesses 
and documents which were a part of the charge sheet. The High 
Court has observed that in the diary entries made by accused 
no.1, the word “Dilipbhai” has been mentioned at the top. 
Against the entries of the amounts of Rs.3,50,000/- and 
Rs.1,50,000/-, the letters DM have been mentioned. However, 
no witness stated that the letters DM meant the respondent, 
not Dushyant Mulani. As pointed out earlier, in reply to the 
discharge application, the appellant admitted that letters DM 
refer to Dushyant Mulani and not the respondent.  

 
 
 Criminal Appeal No. 3863 of 2024 
 
Page 8 of 8 
 
14. 
We have perused the entries in the diary allegedly made 
by accused no.1. Though, on the top of the page, the name Shri 
Dilip Bhai appears, both the entries regarding the sum of 
Rs.3,50,000/- and Rs.1,50,000/- refer to DM.  
15. 
Therefore, except for the bald allegation of participation 
in the alleged conspiracy without giving any details of the 
conspiracy, the respondent has been roped in the charge sheet. 
His name did not appear in the First Information Report. 
Taking the material forming part of the charge sheet as true, it 
cannot be said that a prima facie case of involvement of the 
respondent was made out. In the circumstances, we find no 
error in the view taken by the High Court when it discharged 
the respondent.  
16. 
Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. We make it clear that 
the observations made by the High Court and this Court 
remain confined only to the role ascribed to the respondent.
