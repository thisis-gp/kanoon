Land Acquisition 
Collector (LAC), Delhi State Industrial and 
Infrastructure 
Development 
Corporation 
(DSIIDC), 
East 
Delhi 
Municipal Corporation, and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (DMRC) 
(collectively, the “appellants”), against various identical orders of the 
High Court of Delhi, whereby acquisition proceedings had been declared 
to have lapsed in terms of Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair 
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Rehabilitation 
and Resettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter, the “2013 Act”). Multiple 
Review Petitions and Miscellaneous Applications have also been moved 
by the DDA seeking recall and review of certain orders of this Court 
dismissing their SLPs, whereby some of the land acquisition 
proceedings were declared to have lapsed.  
3. 
While the factual matrix giving rise to the present controversy has 
been elaborated in a judgement of the even date passed by us in the 
matter of GNCTD (through Secretary, Land and Building Dept.) v. 
KL Rathi Steels Ltd.,1 a very brief overview of the relevant facts has 
been set out below. 
A.  
FACTS 
3.1. The GNCTD initiated the land acquisition process under the Land 
Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter, “1894 Act”) for the planned 
                                                
1 MA No. 414/2023.

development of Delhi. The beneficiaries of such acquisition process were 
various state entities such as DDA, DSIIDC, and DMRC, who needed 
the lands for different projects like residential schemes, industrial 
areas, flyovers, the Delhi Metro, etc. Accordingly, over a long span of 
1957-2006, various notifications under Sections 4 and 6 of the 1894 
Act were issued for acquiring these lands and awards were passed 
under Section 11 of the 1894 Act affixing compensation.  
3.2. In some cases, the compensation amount was deposited in the 
treasury since the landowners did not come forward to receive the same. 
Similarly, possession could not be taken in some cases as the affected 
landowners had challenged the acquisition proceedings and had 
obtained an order of stay in their favour.  
3.3. In the meanwhile, the 2013 Act was enacted by the Parliament, 
thereby repealing the 1894 Act. This new legislation brought about 
various reforms to the land acquisition process. Importantly, Section 24 
of the 2013 Act provided that land acquisition proceedings initiated 
under the earlier regime would be deemed to have lapsed in certain 
cases, including when compensation had not been paid or possession 
had not been taken. The provision reads as follows: 
“(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, in any case of 
land acquisition proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition 
Act, 1894 (1 of 1894),—  

 
 
 
66
(a) where no award under Section 11 of the said Land Acquisition 
Act has been made, then, all provisions of this Act relating to the 
determination of compensation shall apply; or 
(b) where an award under said Section 11 has been made, then 
such proceedings shall continue under the provisions of the said 
Land Acquisition Act, as if the said Act has not been repealed. 
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), in case 
of land acquisition proceedings initiated under the Land 
Acquisition Act, 1894, where an award under the said Section 
11 has been made five years or more prior to the 
commencement of this Act but the physical possession of the 
land has not been taken or the compensation has not been 
paid the said proceedings shall be deemed to have lapsed 
and the appropriate Government, if it so chooses, shall initiate the 
proceedings of such land acquisition afresh in accordance with the 
provisions of this Act.  
Provided that where an award has been made and compensation 
in respect of a majority of land holdings has not been deposited in 
the account of the beneficiaries, then, all beneficiaries specified in 
the notification for acquisition under Section 4 of the said Land 
Acquisition Act, shall be entitled to compensation in accordance 
with the provisions of this Act”  
[emphasis supplied] 
3.4. One of the first cases interpreting Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act 
was Pune Municipal Corporation v. Harak Chand Mistrimal 
Solanki,2 in which a three-judge bench of this Court held that offering 
payment to the landowner and depositing it with the Reference Court in 
case of certain contingencies under Section 31(2) of the 1894 Act, would 
fulfil the requirement of the compensation being “paid”.3 Accordingly, 
depositing compensation with the Government Treasury was held to not 
constitute payment of compensation for purposes of Section 24(2) of the 
                                                
2 (2014) 3 SCC 183, para 17. 
3 The contingencies being, when landowners do not give consent to receive 
compensation, there is no person competent to alienate the land, or there is dispute 
regarding title to receive the compensation. 

 
 
 
67
2013 Act and such land acquisition proceedings were held to have 
lapsed.  
3.5. In a subsequent judgment of Sree Balaji Nagar Residential 
Association v. State of Tamil Nadu,4 a two-judge bench of this Court 
further elucidated the concept of taking possession by holding that the 
period during which an order of stay is in operation is not excluded by 
Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act. Consequently, this Court held that an 
operation of stay would not ameliorate a failure to take possession and 
that such acquisition proceedings would be deemed to have lapsed. 
3.6. Relying on these two decisions, the present respondent-
landowners approached the High Court from 2014 to 2017 seeking 
declaration(s) that the acquisition proceedings initiated by GNCTD had 
lapsed because of non-payment of compensation or non-taking of 
possession. Following the dictum in Pune Municipal Corporation 
(supra) and Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association (supra), the 
High Court allowed the landowners’ claim and declared the acquisition 
proceedings as lapsed. The appellants preferred SLPs against some of 
these orders, many of which were in turn dismissed by this Court either 
in limine or after granting leave. 
                                                
4 (2015) 3 SCC 353, para 11. 

 
 
 
68
3.7. However, a two-judge bench of this Court in Yogesh Neema v. 
State of Madhya Pradesh5 doubted the correctness of Sree Balaji 
Nagar Residential Association (supra). Relying upon the maxim 
“actus curiae neminem gravabit” (i.e., the act of court should not 
prejudice the parties), the bench referred for reconsideration the 
question of law regarding the effect of an order of stay on possession 
under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act to a larger bench.  
3.8. Similarly, another two-judge bench of this Court in Indore 
Development Authority v. Shailendra6 doubted the correctness of 
Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and referred the question of law 
regarding the manner of payment under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act 
for reconsideration.  
3.9. Both these issues were considered by a three-judge bench of this 
Court in Indore Development Authority v. Shailendra.7 The larger 
bench held, inter alia, that the term “paid” in Section 24(2) of the 2013 
Act is to be read as “tender” of payment, i.e., an offer to pay. In case the 
compensation was tendered and the same was refused, it was to be 
interpreted as “paid”. Further, on account of various rules made under 
Section 55 of the 1894 Act, it was held that the term “deposit” in the 
proviso to Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act must be read to include a 
                                                
5 (2016) 6 SCC 387, para 6-7.

7 (2018) 3 SCC 412, para 216-217.

deposit of compensation with the Government Treasury, and not just 
with the Reference Court. The three-judge bench then held that Pune 
Municipal Corporation (supra) was per incuriam as it failed to consider 
the statutory rules made under Section 55 of the 1894 Act and as it also 
did not take notice of appropriate precedents for interpreting the term 
“paid”. Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association (supra) was also 
overruled in so far as it allowed landowners to unduly benefit from 
orders of stay.   
3.10. It is in the aftermath of Shailendra (supra) that the appellants 
filed most of the present appeals, Review Petitions and Miscellaneous 
Applications seeking a favourable determination of their rights. 
3.11. Meanwhile, in State of Haryana v. GD Goenka Tourism 
Corporation Ltd.,8 it was argued that since Pune Municipal 
Corporation (supra) and Shailendra (supra) were decided by a bench 
of equal strength, the matter should be referred to a larger bench. This 
Court deferred the hearing to a later date and held that pending a final 
decision on referring the matter to a larger Bench, the High Courts shall 
not deal with any case relating to the interpretation of Section 24 of the 
2013 Act. Subsequently, two different benches of this Court issued even 
date orders on 22.02.2018 in Indore Development Authority v. 
                                                
8 (2018) 3 SCC 585, para 9. 

 
 
 
70
Shyam Verma9 and State of Haryana v. Maharana Pratap 
Charitable Trust (Regd.),10 referring the matter to a larger bench. 
3.12. Eventually, a five-judge bench decided these questions of law in 
Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal11 and held, inter alia, 
that the term “or” in Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act shall be read as “and”, 
such that for land acquisition proceedings to lapse under this Section, 
neither the compensation must have been paid nor the possession must 
have been taken. With respect to payment of compensation, it was held 
that the term “paid” means tendering of payment and the term “deposit” 
in Section 24 of the 2013 Act includes deposit both with the government 
treasury and the Reference Court. Hence, land acquisition proceedings 
cannot be deemed to have lapsed if compensation was tendered to the 
landowner and later deposited in the Treasury. With respect to 
possession, the Constitution Bench held that the period of stay granted 
in favour of landowners ought to be excluded. Consequently, Pune 
Municipal Corporation (supra) and Sree Balaji Nagar Residential 
Association (supra) were overruled. This Court also overruled 
Shailendra (supra), since the question of reading the conditions under 
Section 24(2) conjunctively (i.e., reading “or” as ‘and’) was not 
considered by that case. Subsequently, in light of the decision in 
                                                
9 (2020) 15 SCC 342, para 3. 
10 (2018) SCC Online SC 3600, para 1. 
11 (2020) 8 SCC 129, para 366. 

 
 
 
71
Manoharlal (supra), the judgment in Pune Municipal Corporation 
(supra) was recalled.  
3.13. After the dust stood settled finally in Manoharlal (supra), the 
appellants filed another batch of appeals against such orders of the 
High Court of Delhi which had relied on Pune Municipal Corporation 
(supra) and Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association (supra) to 
declare the acquisition proceedings as having lapsed. Similarly, Review 
Petitions and Miscellaneous Applications were filed against the orders 
of this Court dismissing the SLPs filed previously.  
3.14.  To simplify, the present batch of matters before us can broadly 
be classified into the following three categories:  
(a) 
First, cases filed before Shailendra (supra). Most of the 
SLPs in this category were dismissed by this Court after granting 
leave, on the strength of Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and 
Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association (supra), but a few 
were deferred to a later date and are still pending; 
(b) 
Second, cases filed after Shailendra (supra), on the ground 
that Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association (supra) has been 
overruled and Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) has been held 
to be per incuriam; and 

 
 
 
72
(c) 
Third, cases filed after Manoharlal (supra) which overruled 
both Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and Sree Balaji Nagar 
Residential Association (supra), with a plea that the High Court 
decisions deserve to be revisited given the principles enunciated in 
Manoharlal (supra). 
3.15. We note that a factor common to most of the matters mentioned 
in paragraph 3.14 above is that they were filed after the expiration of 
the period of limitation. The quantum of delay differs in each case, and 
while it is less in the cases filed in the first category, it is significantly 
long in the second and third categories. Hence, at this stage, it is 
important to first examine at length the prayer for condonation of delay 
and the maintainability of these petitions, before delving into the merits 
of each case.  
B.  
CONTENTIONS OF PARTIES 
4. 
The appellants were represented by Ld. Attorney General for India, 
Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, Ld. Additional Solicitor General, and Senior 
Advocates, including Ms. Rachna Srivastava, Mr. Sanjay Poddar, Mr. 
Sanjib Sen, and Mr. Kailash Vasdev. From the side of Respondents, we 
were assisted by an array of Senior Advocates, including Mr. Dhruv 
Mehta, Mr. Gopal Sankaranarayanan, Mr. Jayant Bhushan, Mr. Jayant 

 
 
 
73
Mehta, Ms. Vibha Datta Makhija, and Mr. Vikas Singh, and Ms. Bansuri 
Swaraj, Advocate. 
5. 
The appellants argued that they had sufficient cause for not filing 
the appeals and applications within the prescribed time. Substantiating 
this, they made the following submissions: 
(a) 
The 
respondent-landowners 
had 
suppressed 
certain 
material facts from the High Court. Once the appellants discovered 
these fraudulent claims, they filed the present appeals. In 
Commissioner of Customs v. Candid Enterprises,12 this Court 
held that fraud vitiates the delay that occurred before its discovery. 
The discovery of the facts suppressed by the respondents before the 
High Court, gives rise to a fresh cause of action and, hence the 
period preceding the revelation of such fraud deserves to be 
excluded while calculating the limitation period. 
(b) 
The appellants were disabled from filing appeals within the 
prescribed limitation period because the governing law during such 
period as laid down in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and 
Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association (supra), would have 
caused the dismissal of their petitions. Since the question of law was 
finally decided in their favour in Shailendra (supra) and 
                                                
12 (2002) 9 SCC 764, para 6. 

 
 
 
74
Manoharlal (supra), their cause of action stood revived to enable 
them to approach this Court. Further, a case is applied 
retrospectively unless the judgment expressly recites otherwise, as 
held in CIT v. Saurashtra Kutch Stock Exchange Ltd.13 Since 
Manoharlal (supra) did not restrict its applicability prospectively, 
all the cases decided before thereto deserve to be re-decided based 
on the principles enunciated in it. 
(c) 
The Court should take a liberal approach regarding 
condonation of delay and allow leeway to the government 
authorities, who, on account of their impersonal character, multiple 
chains of approval, processing of a large number of files, and lack of 
resources, unintentionally cross the prescribed limitation timeline 
and suffer bureaucratic delay.  
(d) 
The delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic deserves to be 
condoned as the restrictions on movement during the lockdown, 
defuncted the appellants who did not have a well-equipped 
technological infrastructure in place to meet such unexpected and 
newer challenges. The appellants in this regard placed reliance on 
various decisions of this Court including Collector (LA), Anantnag 
v. Katiji,14 G. Ramegowda v. Spl. Land Acquisition Officer,15 
                                                
13 (2008) 14 SCC 171, para 35. 
14 (1987) 2 SCC 107, para 3. 
15 (1988) 2 SCC 142, para 17. 

 
 
 
75
State of Manipur v. Koting Lamkang,16 and Sheo Raj Singh v. 
Union of India.17 
(e) 
The appellants could not file the appeals on time because 
the Court was frowning upon the filing of multiple fresh SLPs despite 
the law having been settled in Pune Municipal Corporation 
(supra), and was imposing costs while dismissing such SLPs. 
(f)  
In various cases such as Imrat Lal v. LAC,18 this Court has 
held that delay can be condoned in the interest of justice. In the 
present case also, the Court should condone the delay in public 
interest and subserve the cause of justice as the acquisition 
proceedings were undertaken for projects of eminent public 
importance like the expansion of the metro, construction of flyovers, 
hospitals, etc. 
6. 
Per contra, the respondent-land owners vociferously argued that 
the appellants have failed to showcase sufficient cause in filing the 
appeals and applications with enormous delay and that:  
(a) 
It is false to claim that the landowners had suppressed 
material facts during the proceedings in the High Court. 
Alternatively, even if some of the landowners did suppress the facts, 
                                                
16 (2019) 10 SCC 408, para 8. 
17 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1278, para 11. 
18 (2014) 14 SCC 133, para 11. 

 
 
 
76
these were only a handful of instances that could not be used for 
condoning delay in all the appeals and applications. 
(b) 
 Delay cannot be condoned based on subsequent change of 
law. If it were to be allowed as a legitimate ground for condonation 
of delay, no proceedings would ever reach finality because cases 
could be re-opened whenever a question of law were to be interpreted 
differently. Further, Shailendra (supra) and Manoharlal (supra) 
could not be applied retrospectively, since overruling of cases relying 
on Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and Sree Balaji Nagar 
Residential Association (supra) took away only their precedential 
effect and did not re-open the lis between the parties in those cases. 
The respondents have in this regard relied upon various decisions of 
this Court including Neelima Srivastava v. State of UP19 and 
Natural Resources Allocation, In re, Special Reference 1 of 
2012.20  
(c) 
There should be parity between private parties and 
government entities with respect to the yardstick to be applied for 
condonation of delay and no leeway should be granted to the latter 
                                                
19 2021 SCC Online SC 610, para 29. 
20 (2012) 10 SCC 1, para 48. 

 
 
 
77
(relied on, inter alia, Postmaster General v. Living Media India 
Ltd)21. 
(d) 
This Court has made it clear in Sagufa Ahmed v. Upper 
Assam Plywood Products (P) Ltd.,22 that the relaxation on account 
of COVID-19 can be granted only in those cases where the limitation 
period expired during COVID-19. Such relaxation would not be 
available in the present case as the period of limitation for filing the 
appeals had expired much before the pandemic.  
(e) 
Delay cannot be condoned on the grounds of the Court 
frowning upon the filing of fresh SLPs as no sufficient material to 
substantiate such a plea has been placed on record.   
(f) 
The grounds of public interest or cause of justice cannot be 
invoked to condone the delay, for even if the law of limitation 
produces a harsh outcome, it ought to be followed. The respondents 
have buttressed this plea by citing Pundlik Jalam Patil v. 
Executive Engineer, Jalgaon Medium Project,23 in which this 
Court held that delay cannot be condoned solely on the ground of 
public interest and to do justice because third-party rights may have 
been created during the prolonged delay and it would be unfair for 
                                                
21 (2012) 3 SCC 563, para 28. 
22 (2021) 2 SCC 317, para 17. 
23 (2008) 17 SCC 448, para 30. 

 
 
 
78
such parties if the delay is condoned and the settled position is 
reversed. 
C. LAW ON CONDONATION OF DELAY 
7. 
Since the issue in this batch of appeals concerns the condonation 
of delay, it would be worthwhile to briefly allude to the law of limitation. 
The Limitation Act, 1963 (“Limitation Act”) is a statute of repose founded 
on considerations of public policy and expediency. The dominant 
objective underlying the law of limitation is that the title to property, 
and matters of rights in general, cannot be kept in a state of constant 
uncertainty, doubt or suspense. Public interest requires that finality 
should be put to litigation. The Limitation Act, thus, prescribes the 
specific points of time from which the period of limitation begins to run 
for the institution of actions. On expiry of such period, no action can be 
initiated save and except where the court condones the delay for a 
sufficient cause. A party who is insensible to the value of civil remedies, 
and who does not assert his claim with promptitude is denied the ability 
to enforce even an otherwise rightful claim. This position is reflected in 
the Latin maxim, vigilantibus et non dormientibus jura subveniunt, i.e., 
the law aids the vigilant and not those who sleep on their rights. 

 
 
 
79
8. 
The Bombay High Court in Kumudini Ramdas Shah v. K.M. 
Mody24 aptly exposited the philosophical pillars supporting the concept 
of limitation: (i) the sword of prosecution ought not to be hanging over 
an individual for an indeterminate period; (ii) those who have been 
lethargic in safeguarding their interests should not expect the law to 
come to their rescue; and (iii) a defendant ought not to suffer for lost 
evidence owing to the passage of time.  
9. 
Section 3 of the Limitation Act reflects this philosophy. Every suit 
or appeal made after the period of limitation ought to be dismissed, 
notwithstanding whether such ground had been raised by the opposite 
side. However, this does not imply that the Limitation Act destroys the 
right itself. Instead, it only extinguishes the ability to enforce the right, 
without either creating or destroying the underlying cause of action or 
entitlement itself.  
10. 
As is clear from a plain reading of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 
there are exceptions to this general rule. The statute allows for 
admitting an action provided “sufficient cause” is shown. This vests 
courts with the discretion to extend the period of limitation if the 
applicant can show that he had sufficient cause for not preferring an 
appeal or application within the prescribed period. Section 5 requires 
analysis of two ingredients: first, an examination of whether “sufficient 
                                                
24 Kumudini Ramdas Shah v. K.M. Mody & Ors., AIR 1985 Bombay 320, para 4. 

 
 
 
80
cause” has been made out; and second, whether such cause has been 
shown for not filing the appeal/application “within the prescribed 
period”. 
11. 
As regards the first ingredient, the Limitation Act itself does not 
provide more guidance on what its constituent elements ought to be. 
Instead, Section 5 leaves the task of determining appropriate reasons 
for seeking condonation of delay to judicial interpretation and exercise 
of discretion upon the facts and individual circumstances of each case.   
12. 
While there is no arithmetical formula, through decades of judicial 
application, certain yardsticks for judging the sufficiency of cause for 
condonation of delay have evolved. Mere good cause is not sufficient 
enough to turn back the clock and allow resuscitation of a claim 
otherwise barred by delay. The court ought to be cautious while 
undertaking such an exercise, being circumspect against condoning 
delay which is attributable to the applicant.25 Although the actual 
period of delay might be instructive, it is the explanation for the delay 
which would be the decisive factor.26 
13. 
The court must also desist from throwing the baby out with the 
bathwater. A justice-oriented approach must be prioritized over 
                                                
25 Basawaraj v. Land Acquisition Officer, (2013) 14 SCC 81, para 9-11. 
26 Perumon Bhagvathy Devaswom v. Bhargavi Amma, (2008) 8 SCC 321, para 13. 

 
 
 
81
technicalities,27 as one motivation underlying such rules is to prevent 
parties from using dilatory tactics or abusing the judicial process. 
Pragmatism over pedanticism is therefore sometimes necessary – 
despite it appearing liberal or magnanimous. The expression ‘sufficient 
cause’ should be given liberal construction so as to advance substantial 
justice.28  
14. 
In addition to “sufficient cause”, Section 5 also requires that such 
cause must be shown within the prescribed period. To satisfy the latter 
condition, the applicant must show sufficient cause for not filing the 
appeal/application on the last day of the prescribed period and explain 
the delay made thereafter.29 Causes arising after the culmination of the 
limitation period, despite being sufficient in substance, would not 
suffice for condonation given this second prong of Section 5 of the 
Limitation Act. However, the applicant shall not be required to prove 
each day’s delay till the date of filing such appeal/application.30  
15. 
With these broad yardsticks in mind, we shall now separately 
analyze each ground pleaded by the appellants on the anvil of 
sufficiency.

D.  
WHETHER DELAY SHOULD BE CONDONED IN THE PRESENT 
CASES? 
D.1. Suppression of facts by the landowners 
16. 
The appellants argued that the respondent-landowners had 
suppressed material facts from the High Court, including previous 
unsuccessful litigations. Acquisitions were in fact already complete in 
many of these cases, a fact that was deliberately not disclosed. Other 
respondent-landowners also concealed from the court how they were 
only subsequent purchasers who had acquired the lands after they had 
been notified for the acquisition. Similarly, in some cases, the 
landowners suppressed the fact that the acquired lands had already 
vested in their respective Gaon Sabhas. 
17. 
In addition to highlighting the factum of suppression, the 
appellants have also demonstrated materiality. They urged that had 
these facts been disclosed before the High Court, the respondents would 
have been estopped from seeking the declaration that the acquisition 
proceedings had lapsed. The appellants have in this regard placed 
reliance on Meera Sahni v. Lt. Governor of Delhi31 and Section 3 of 
Delhi Lands (Restrictions on Transfer) Act, 1972, to fortify their 
contention that no bona fide sale transaction could take place in respect 
                                                
31 (2008) 9 SCC 177, para 21. 

 
 
 
83
of the lands which were already the subject matter of acquisition 
process. These concealments, they submitted, amount to playing fraud 
on both the court and the public exchequer. Accordingly, the time spent 
in the discovery of such suppressions should be deducted from the 
overall quantum of delay. 
18. 
In this regard, the appellants have cited Section 17 of the 
Limitation Act, which provides that: 
 “…the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the 
plaintiff or applicant has discovered the fraud or the 
mistake or could, with reasonable diligence, have 
discovered it, or in the case of a concealed document, until the 
plaintiff or the applicant first had the means of producing the 
concealed document or compelling its production.”  
[emphasis supplied] 
19. 
There can indeed be no quarrel that Section 17 of the Limitation 
Act is premised on the well-known principle that fraud vitiates the delay 
and provides a cause of action once discovered.32 The appellants’ 
contention, however, has to be evaluated keeping in view the stand 
taken on behalf of the respondent-landowners who have refuted the 
omnibus allegation of suppression of facts against all of them. We have 
already noticed in paragraph 6(a) above that according to the 
respondent-landowners there are only a few cases where the allegation 
of suppression of material facts merits consideration. 
                                                
32 Commissioner of Customs v. Candid Enterprises, (2002) 9 SCC 764, para 6. 

 
 
 
84
20. 
We may also hasten to clarify the scope of our enquiry. The 
respondent-landowners have not been called upon to refute or admit 
the allegations of concealment of facts attributed to some of them. 
Similarly, we have not asked the appellants to produce original records 
and documents to substantiate their allegation of concealment and 
suppression of material facts. We are conscious that entering into an 
arena of factual controversy at such an advanced stage of litigation, and 
that too without giving adequate opportunities to the parties can be a 
potential threat to the cause of justice. Simultaneously, we are satisfied 
that the appellants’ contention in this regard cannot be brushed aside 
lightly.  
21. 
Without expressing any final definitive opinion on such allegations 
of concealment, we are of the considered view that the appellants have 
discharged a prima facie burden for the limited purpose of making out 
a case for condonation of delay in the cases mentioned in the appended 
‘List-A’, which shall be read as a part of this judgment. We believe that 
a fact-finding exercise is necessary in these cases, and hence, there 
exist sufficient grounds for the condonation of delay. The nature of relief 
to be eventually granted after condoning the delay, will be separately 
dealt with in Part E of this order. 

 
 
 
85
D.2. Change of law 
22. 
Another ground taken by appellants for seeking condonation of 
delay is the subsequent change of law brought in by Shailendra 
(supra) and Manoharlal (supra). However, we are unable to agree with 
this contention because of four primary reasons.  
23. 
Firstly, this ground seeks to use events temporally subsequent to 
the expiry of the limitation period to justify the delay. To revisit Section 
5 of the Limitation Act, the text of the statute provides that an appeal 
or application may be admitted after the prescribed period if the 
“appellant or the applicant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause 
for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such 
period”. Hence, the appellants are required to explain that they were 
diligent during the prescribed period of limitation and could not file the 
appeal because of a “sufficient cause” arising within the prescribed 
period.  
24. 
This understanding is squarely covered by the case of Ajit Singh 
Thakur v. State of Gujarat,33 which had an analogous factual 
situation. The appellants in the cited case were accused of killing one 
Manilal and injuring Bhulabhai and others and were acquitted by the 
trial court. Against this, Bhulabhai filed a revision petition before the 
                                                
33 (1981) 1 SCC 495, para 6. 

 
 
 
86
High Court, which passed certain observations stating that it is a fit 
case for the State to file an appeal. Consequently, the State filed an 
appeal and sought condonation of delay. While the High Court allowed 
it, this Court held that the condonation of delay was improper. The 
Court held: 
“6. At the outset, it is urged by learned counsel for the 
appellants that the High Court erred in condoning the delay in 
filing the appeal, and the appeal should have been dismissed 
as barred by limitation. We have examined the facts carefully. 
It appears that initially the State Government took a 
decision not to file an appeal and it allowed the period 
of limitation to lapse. Subsequently, on certain 
observations made by the High Court while considering 
a revision petition by Bhulabhai that it was a fit case 
where the State Government should file an appeal and 
on notice being issued by the High Court to the State 
Government in the matter, the appeal was filed. It was 
filed three months after limitation had expired. A faint 
attempt was made to show that when the initial decision was 
taken not to file an appeal all the papers had not been 
considered by the department concerned, but we are not 
impressed by that allegation. The truth appears to be that 
the appeal was not filed at first because the State 
Government saw no case on the merits for an appeal, 
and it was filed only because the High Court had 
observed — and that was long after limitation had 
expired — that the case was fit for appeal by the State 
Government. Now, it is true that a party is entitled to 
wait until the last day of limitation for filing an appeal. 
But when it allows limitation to expire and pleads 
sufficient cause for not filing the appeal earlier, the 
sufficient cause must establish that because of some 
event or circumstance arising before limitation expired 
it was not possible to file the appeal within time. No 
event or circumstance arising after the expiry of 
limitation can constitute such sufficient cause. There 
may be events or circumstances subsequent to the expiry 
of limitation which may further delay the filing of the 
appeal. But that the limitation has been allowed to 

 
 
 
87
expire without the appeal being filed must be traced to 
a cause arising within the period of limitation. In the 
present case, there was no such cause, and the High Court 
erred in condoning the delay.”  
 
[emphasis supplied] 
 
25. 
Similarly, in most of these cases, the prescribed period of 
limitation had already expired long before the judgments in Shailendra 
(supra) and Manoharlal (supra) were delivered. The appellants let the 
limitation period lapse, perhaps because they saw no case on merits for 
appeal. When the law was subsequently re-interpreted in the afore-cited 
two cases, the appellants approached this Court with the present 
appeals, petitions, and applications. Instead of showing a sufficient 
cause arising within the period of limitation, they are using an event 
after the expiry of such period to justify the delay. This does not square 
with our understanding of the law, and cannot be allowed.  
26. 
This leads us to the second reason for disagreeing with the 
ground, which is that a party cannot be allowed to take advantage of its 
deliberate inaction during the limitation period. Allowing to the contrary 
would distort incentives for parties and create dystopian consequences 
for our judicial process. To put this in right perspective, two scenarios 
can be juxtaposed: one, where the appellants had been vigilant and had 
preferred an appeal within the limitation period, but would have failed 
to succeed as the governing law during that time was as stated by Pune 
Municipal Corporation (supra) and Sree Balaji Nagar Residential 

 
 
 
88
Association (supra); and second, where the appellants deliberately 
allowed the limitation period to expire and have now approached this 
Court using the subsequent change of law as a ground for allowing the 
appeals. Now, if the appellants are allowed to file the appeals in the 
second scenario, it will lead to an anomalous situation where the 
appellants that were vigilant were not able to get the remedy but the 
ones that were sleeping over their rights would obtain relief. This would 
run counter to the purpose of the Limitation Act, which, instead of 
giving finality to the proceedings, would be permitting the parties to use 
the delay to their advantage.  
27. 
Thirdly, if subsequent change of law is allowed as a valid ground 
for condonation of delay, it would open a Pandora’s Box where all the 
cases that were subsequently overruled, or the cases that had relied on 
the judgements that were subsequently overruled, would approach this 
Court and would seek a relief based on the new interpretation of law. 
There would be no finality to the proceedings and every time this Court 
would reach a different conclusion from its previous case, all such cases 
and the cases relying on it would be reopened. 
28. 
We find adequate support to our afore-stated reason in 
Tilokchand & Motichand v. H.B. Munshi,34 in which a 5-Judge Bench 
of this Court had the occasion to consider the question of condonation 
                                                
34 (1969) 1 SCC 110, para 12. 

 
 
 
89
of delay on the basis of subsequent change of law. While giving the 
majority opinion, Hidayatullah, CJ. held: 
“[…] Everybody is presumed to know the law. It was his duty 
to have brought the matter before this Court for consideration. 
In any event, having set the machinery of law in motion 
he cannot abandon it to resume it after a number of 
years, because another person more adventurous than 
he in his turn got the statute declared unconstitutional, 
and got a favourable decision. If I were to hold 
otherwise, then the decision of the High Court in any 
case once adjudicated upon and acquiesced in, may be 
questioned in a fresh litigation revived only with the 
argument that the correct position was not known to the 
petitioner at the time when he abandoned his own 
litigation. […]” 
[emphasis supplied] 
 
29. 
Finally, the fourth reason why subsequent overruling of a 
judgement cannot be a sufficient cause is because when a case is 
overruled, it is only its binding nature as a precedent that is taken away 
and the lis between the parties is still deemed to have been settled by 
the overruled case.35 It is a settled principle of law that even an 
erroneous decision operates as res judicata between the parties.36 
Hence, when Manoharlal (supra) overruled Pune Municipal 
Corporation (supra) and Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association 
(supra), as well as all other cases relying on them, it only overruled their 
precedential value, and did not reopen the lis between the parties. The 
mere fact that the impugned orders in the present case were overruled 
                                                
35 Neelima Srivastava v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 2021 SCC Online SC 610, para 30. 
36 R. Unnikrishnan v. V.K. Mahanudevan, (2014) 4 SCC 434, para 19-23. 

 
 
 
90
by Manoharlal (supra) would not, therefore, be a sufficient ground to 
argue that the cases should be reopened. 
30. 
In this respect, it would be pertinent to highlight an exception—
cases that are still pending before this Court. If the lis is still pending 
and has not reached finality, those cases would be decided on the basis 
of Manoharlal (supra). This is because a decision on the interpretation 
of law is applied retrospectively unless the court specifically rules as to 
its prospective applicability.  
31. 
There can, however, be no doubt that a lis will have to be decided 
as per the new interpretation if during its pendency, the law has been 
construed in a different manner by a subsequent judgement. We say so 
for the reason that such new construction shall be deemed to be the 
correct understanding of the statute from its very inception. We find 
support in this regard from Shyam Madan Mohan Ruia v. Messer 
Holdings Ltd.,37 in which the High Court had dismissed the suit based 
on the decision of this Court in Foreshore Coop. Housing Society Ltd. 
v. Praveen D. Desai.38 During the pendency of appeal, Foreshore 
Coop. Housing Society Ltd. (supra) was overruled in the case of Nusli 
Neville Wadia v. Ivory Properties.39 This Court while deciding the 
issue in Shyam Mohan Ruia (supra), held that since the precedent 
                                                
37 (2020) 5 SCC 252, para 18. 
38 (2015) 6 SCC 412. 
39 (2020) 6 SCC 557. 

 
 
 
91
forming the very basis of the High Court’s decision stood overruled, the 
dispute before it must be decided as per the later decision. 
32. 
To sum up, we hold that subsequent change of law will not be 
attracted unless a case is pending before the competent court awaiting 
its final adjudication. To say it differently, if a case has already been 
decided, it cannot be re-opened and re-decided solely on the basis of a 
new interpretation given to that law.  
D.3. Leeway to be granted to government entities 
33. 
The appellants have vehemently contended that the government 
entities ought to be allowed leeway for condonation of delay. For this, 
the appellants placed reliance on Collector (LA) (supra) and G. 
Ramegowda (supra) which held that courts ought to be generous while 
considering delay on the part of government entities given factors 
unique to them like the impersonal nature of their functioning, 
inherited bureaucratic methodology, and procedural red-tapeism. 
34. 
However, with time, the position of law held in these cases has 
been diluted. In Commissioner of Wealth Tax v. Amateur Riders 
Club,40 this Court noted that while latitude can be granted to the 
                                                
40 (1994) Supp. (2) SCC 603, para 3. 

 
 
 
92
government, it has to show its bona fide and diligence in filing the 
appeals. In case of bureaucratic indifference, delay cannot be condoned.  
35. 
Subsequently, in the case of Postmaster General (supra), this 
Court noted that the delay cannot be condoned mechanically only 
because the appellant is a government entity. The Court explicitly 
negated the earlier rationale of impersonal machinery and inherited 
bureaucratic methodology given modern improvements in technology. 
Lastly, the Court held that government entities must show bona fide 
and demonstrate diligence in pursuing the matter.  
36. 
This Court has again in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Bherulal,41 
reiterated the reasoning of the Postmaster General (supra) and held 
that the Collector (LA) (supra) could not be relied upon any longer as 
it was laid down in a different bureaucratic and technological period. 
The proposition that government entities ought to be afforded greater 
latitude on issues of delay on account of administrative exigencies, is 
no longer a precedent to be followed routinely.  
37. 
Although the appellants have cited two more decisions of this 
Court in support of their prayer for condonation of delay, we find both 
of them distinguishable on facts. In Koting Lamkang (supra) a three-
judge bench of this Court, in the peculiar circumstances where certain 
                                                
41 (2020) 10 SCC 654, para 3. 

 
 
 
93
individual officers had acted with mala fide, chose not to extend the 
burden of individual recklessness to the State’s institutional interest; 
as may be seen from the following extract: 
“8. Regard should be had in similar such circumstances to the 
impersonal nature of the Government's functioning where 
individual officers may fail to act responsibly. This in 
turn, would result in injustice to the institutional 
interest of the State. If the appeal filed by the State are 
lost for individual default, those who are at fault, will 
not usually be individually affected.”  
[emphasis supplied] 
38. 
Similarly, in Sheo Raj Singh (supra), the marked distinction was 
the scope of interference by this Court while exercising judicial review 
of an order of condoning delay passed by a High Court. This Court 
distinguished between the two situations, namely: (i) its constraints 
while sitting in appeal over a discretionary order; and (ii) itself 
considering an application for condonation of delay. Such a distinction 
is discernable from the following passage in Sheo Raj Singh (supra): 
“30. Be that as it may, it is important to bear in mind that we 
are not hearing an application for condonation of delay 
but sitting in appeal over a discretionary order of the 
High Court granting the prayer for condonation of delay. 
In the case of the former, whether to condone or not 
would be the only question whereas in the latter, 
whether there has been proper exercise of discretion in 
favour of grant of the prayer for condonation would be 
the question…”  
[emphasis supplied] 
39. 
It seems to us that acceding to the appellants’ request on the 
aforesaid account would also have undesirable consequences. If delay 

 
 
 
94
were to be condoned merely on the basis of a broad general assertion of 
bureaucratic indifference, without requiring demonstration of bona fide 
or an act of mala fide on the part of specific individuals, it would create 
an artificial distinction between the private parties and the government 
entities vis-à-vis the law of limitation. This would not be in conformity 
with the spirit of equality before law as guaranteed under our 
Constitution. Allowing such latitude would further distort incentives for 
the government and encourage more laxity by the bureaucracy in its 
general functioning, thereby undermining quality governance.  
D.4. COVID-19 Pandemic 
40. 
The fourth ground taken by the appellants is that the delay ought 
to be condoned on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. At this juncture, 
it would be apposite to discuss the series of orders passed by this Court 
regarding the operation of limitation vis-à-vis the COVID-19 pandemic.  
41. 
Vide order dt. 23.03.2020 In Re: Cognizance for Extension of 
Limitation,42 this Court passed an omnibus order extending the period 
of limitation for proceedings before all courts/tribunals in the country 
from 15.03.2020 till further orders. Subsequently, vide an order dt. 
08.03.2021, this Court noted the lifting of the nation-wide pandemic 
                                                
42 (2020) 19 SCC 10, para 2. 

 
 
 
95
lockdown and a return to normalcy. Accordingly, the Court brought an 
end to the extension and held that: 
“I. In computing the period of limitation for any suit, appeal, 
application or proceeding, the period from 15.03.2020 till 
14.03.2021 shall stand excluded. Consequently, the 
balance 
period 
of 
limitation 
remaining 
as 
on 
15.03.2020, if any, shall become available with effect 
from 15.03.2021.  
 
II. In cases where the limitation would have expired 
during the period between 15.03.2020 till 14.03.2021, 
notwithstanding the actual balance period of limitation 
remaining, all persons shall have a limitation period of 
90 days from 15.03.2021. In the event the actual balance 
period of limitation remaining, with effect from 15.03.2021, is 
greater than 90 days, that longer period shall apply.  
 
III. The period from 15.03.2020 till 14.03.2021 shall also stand 
excluded in computing the periods prescribed under Sections 
23 (4) and 29A of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, 
Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and provisos 
(b) and (c) of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 
1881 and any other laws, which prescribe period(s) of 
limitation for instituting proceedings, outer limits 
(within which the court or tribunal can condone delay) 
and termination of proceeding […]”.  
 
[emphasis supplied] 
42. 
However, when COVID-19 cases across the country rose again, a 
miscellaneous application was filed and vide an order dt. 27.04.2021,43 
this Court restored the order dated 23.03.2020 and held that the period 
of limitation is to be extended till further orders. This came to an end 
                                                
43 2021 SCC Online SC 373, para 6-7. 

 
 
 
96
on 23.09.2021 when directions to exclude the period between 
15.03.2020 and 02.10.2021 from limitation were issued.44 
43. 
On account of the third wave of Pandemic, the aforementioned 
order dated 23.09.2021 was finally modified on 10.01.2022, with a total 
period of approximately 716 days between 15.03.2020-28.02.2022 
being excluded from the operation of limitation.45 
44. 
The respondents submit that the orders of this Court passed by 
this Court from time to time as referred to above, would not come to the 
aid of the appellants since these orders saved only those actions and 
proceedings which were within the period of limitation as on 
15.03.2020. They contended that the aforementioned orders ought not 
to be construed in a manner to resuscitate actions and proceedings that 
were time-barred before the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. If the 
limitation period had already expired before the pandemic, such cases 
could not take shelter behind the general relief granted by this Court in 
In Re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation (supra). The 
respondents buttressed their arguments by relying upon Sagufa 
Ahmed v. Upper Assam Plywood Products (P) Ltd.46  
                                                
44 2021 SCC Online SC 947, para 8. 
45 (2022) 3 SCC 117, para 5. 
46 (2021) 2 SCC 317, para 17. 

 
 
 
97
45. 
Sagufa Ahmed (supra) construed that the orders passed In Re: 
Cognizance for Extension of Limitation (supra) were intended to 
benefit vigilant litigants who were prevented due to the pandemic and 
the lockdown, from initiating proceedings within the period of limitation 
prescribed by general or special law. We respectfully agree with the view 
taken in Sagufa Ahmed (supra). Consequently, the benefit of In Re: 
Cognizance for Extension of Limitation (supra) can be availed by the 
appellants only in a case where the period of limitation expired between 
15.03.2020 and 28.02.2022. 
D.5. Supreme Court frowning upon the filing of fresh SLPs 
46. 
In addition to the above grounds, the appellants claim that they 
were unable to file the appeals before Shailendra (supra) came as this 
Court was discouraging them from filing fresh SLPs by dismissing such 
petitions in limine and imposing heavy costs. 
47. 
We are not inclined to accept the above stated plea as a good 
ground to condone the delay. Even if the appellants’ contention is 
believed to be true that some of the SLPs were dismissed on the strength 
of the then governing law as laid down in Pune Municipal Corporation 
(supra)), this could not be an impediment for filing SLPs on time. Had 
it been so, this Court would not have had the opportunity to reconsider 
Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and Sree Balaji Nagar 

 
 
 
98
Residential Association (supra). That apart, some of the cases which 
are part of this batch were filed before Shailendra (supra), which belies 
the appellants’ stance. Instead, it is likely that the appellants took a 
careful, considered and conscious call of not agitating their claims as 
they perceived their chances of success to be bleak.  
D.6. Public interest and justice 
48. 
As a final contention, the appellants have sought this Court’s 
indulgence asserting ‘public interest’ and the ‘larger cause of justice’. 
Against this, respondents have argued that the delay cannot be 
condoned merely based on broad assertions of equity. 
49. 
We agree in principle with the respondents to the extent that 
deliberate, reckless or negligent delays ought not to be condoned, even 
if counterweighed by public interest since it may unfairly affect third-
party rights that may have vested during the period of lapse. This 
simplistic framing would, however, not be apt for the present fact 
situation which is far more complex.  
50. 
Although at first glance it might appear that this Court is merely 
tasked with balancing the interests of the public exchequer against that 
of individual respondents, however, a deeper examination would reveal 
that there are many other interests at stake and it might not be possible 

 
 
 
99
to undo the acquisitions without causing significant cascading harms 
and losses to public infrastructure.  
51. 
Most of the acquisitions here have reached finalization as 
possession had been taken over or compensation stood paid. 
Additionally, development projects have also begun on many of such 
lands. In numerous cases, the land has been deployed for essential 
public projects such as hospitals, schools, expansion of the metro, etc. 
Hence, the effect of non-condonation of delay would go beyond mere 
financial loss to the exchequer, and instead extend to the public at 
large.  
52. 
Moreover, there would also be a significant unscrambling the egg 
problem, where compensation paid would have to be clawed back or 
possession taken would have to be reversed. Problematically, in many 
cases, the development projects might also have to be undone. In some 
instances—such as reversing the possession of one small plot lying on 
an under-construction metro corridor—it would be practically 
impossible.  
53. 
As discussed in paragraphs 11 to 13 of this judgement, in addition 
to the bona fides of the condonation-seekers and the broader impact of 
condoning the delay, it is equally important to look at the effect of 
condonation on the opposite side, particularly in cases where rights 
have vested. As the facts speak for themselves, invaluable rights have 

 
 
 
100
been vested to the public at large, given the public infrastructure that 
has come up on a large number of these acquired lands—especially in 
those cases where the possession had been taken.  
54. 
Furthermore, even if we were to settle the lis by not condoning 
delay, it is unlikely that the respondent-landowners would be able to 
keep their lands as the appellants are empowered under law to initiate 
acquisition proceedings afresh. Although there might be a difference in 
the quantum of compensation owed to the respondent-landowners, it 
would come at the expense of delaying the construction of critical public 
infrastructure in our national capital. When balancing public with 
private interest, the quantum and adequacy of compensation do not 
compel us much. Hence, we believe that the comparative impact on the 
respondent-landowners would be minimal. 
55. 
We also cannot be oblivious to the fact that the multiplicity of 
contradictory judicial opinions on Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act within 
a relatively short span of time have made the present set of 
circumstances sui generis. The constant flux in the legal position of law 
undoubtedly created significant challenges for the appellants while 
approaching this Court, none of which we can ignore outrightly. In 
addition, we would also reiterate at this juncture that we have found no 
mala fide on part of the appellants or their officers.  

 
 
 
101
56. 
The impact of not condoning the delay would thus be three-fold, 
which taken altogether make a compelling case for condonation of 
delay: one, there will be significant harm to the public at large by way 
of delayed infrastructure, in addition to financial loss to the public 
exchequer; second, the comparative benefit to landowners would not be 
substantial given that no indefeasible rights have been vested with them 
as the lis has not yet acquired quietus in most cases; and third, the 
matter would still not attain finality as the State is likely to invoke its 
power of eminent domain and reinitiate acquisition proceedings given 
the criticality of the infrastructure being built. We do not feel that these 
consequences further the ends of limitation law. As discussed earlier in 
paragraph 13, the law of limitation is intended to curb the evil of 
deliberate or negligent laxity in legal proceedings, which is not the case 
here. Hence, the larger interest of justice mandates us to condone the 
delay in the present batch of cases. The consequential relief, after 
condonation of delay, is however dealt with in Part E (infra) below.    
57. 
This approach is also seconded by the case of State of 
Jharkhand v. Lalu Prasad Yadav,47 in which this Court noted that 
while the Central Bureau of Investigation failed to follow its own manual 
and filed SLPs with delay, such delay should be condoned in light of the 
facts of the case and to advance the cause of justice. 
                                                
47 (2017) 8 SCC 1, para 67-69. 

 
 
 
102
58. 
We note that the respondents have cited Pundlik Jalam Patil 
(supra) to argue that public interest cannot be a sole ground to seek 
condonation of delay. A closer examination of the aforementioned case, 
however, would show that the Court in that case denied condonation of 
delay as the government had been found to be negligent and given that 
it had been established that the landowners depended on the acquired 
lands for their livelihood. As discussed above, that is not the case here, 
especially in the case of landowners in NCT of Delhi, which is almost 
entirely urban and whose residents generally do not depend on the 
agricultural income as the source of their livelihood.  
D.7. Delay already condoned in some cases 
59. 
While seeking condonation of delay in filing of the present appeals, 
the appellants have also urged that this Court had already condoned 
the delay in some of the SLPs and granted leave in such petitions. 
Against these, the respondents have argued that such condonation was 
done by ex-parte orders. 
60. 
The proviso to Rule 9(1) of Order XXI of the Supreme Court Rules, 
2013 reads: 
“Provided that where a petition for special leave has been filed 
beyond the period of limitation prescribed therefor and is 
accompanied by an application for condonation of delay, the 
Court shall not condone the delay without notice to the 
respondent” 
 

 
 
 
103
[emphasis supplied] 
 
61. 
As per the aforementioned rule, condonation of delay ought not to 
be done by the Court ex-parte. However, an identical version of this rule 
in the previous Supreme Court Rules of 1966 was interpreted in High 
Court of Judicature of Patna v. Madan Mohan Prasad,48 in which, 
this Court held that while it is prudent to give notice before condonation 
of delay, not giving of notice is not fatal to the case. The claimant will 
be allowed to point out at the stage of hearing that this Court was not 
justified in condoning the delay and that the leave, if granted, should 
be revoked or notice issued should be dismissed.  
62. 
The condonation of delay in some of these cases without issuing 
any notice, is now an inconsequential issue, for we have already 
extensively dealt with the grounds for condonation of delay. The 
respondent-landowners too have been heard at length over the course 
of the proceedings, which we believe satisfies the standard laid down in 
Madan Mohan Prasad (supra).  
63. 
Nevertheless, we are also conscious of the fact that no notice was 
issued in some of the cases, and the parties thereto have not been 
accorded an opportunity of hearing. All such cases, which we include 
                                                
48 (2011) 9 SCC 65, para 38.

in the annexed ‘List-B’, are therefore ordered to be de-tagged and be 
listed separately on 22.07.2024.  
E. CONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS 
64. 
The analysis in the foregoing paragraphs prompts us to hold that 
while some of the arguments put forth by the government authorities 
for condonation of delay, like subsequent change of law, special leeway 
for government entities, or the Court allegedly frowning upon filing of 
fresh SLPs; cannot be accepted, however, the appellants have made out 
sufficient cause for condonation of delay on the ground of public 
interest. In addition, the cases where allegations of suppression of 
material facts have been made also cannot be rejected at the threshold. 
Similarly, if a case falls within the parameters laid down in In Re: 
Cognizance for Extension of Limitation (supra), namely, that the 
delay occurred on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, such delay can 
also be condoned.  Consequently, the delay is condoned in all these 
matters, except those mentioned in ‘List-B’, ‘List-C.2’, ‘List-D.2’ and 
‘List-E.1’ (infra). 
65. 
Having condoned the delay and upon grant of leave and after 
perusing the material on record, we find that the cases which form part 
of the appended ‘List-E.2’ are squarely covered in favor of the appellants 
in terms of Manoharlal (supra). While it may not be feasible to give 

 
 
 
105
detailed analysis of each of these cases, suffice it would be to show the 
same illustratively. For instance, in SLP (C) Diary No. 19172/2019, 
titled “DDA v. Vijay Mohan”, while the possession was admittedly not 
taken, compensation was paid on 09.08.2005. Accordingly, the test laid 
down in Manoharlal (supra) has been met and the acquisition 
proceedings cannot be deemed to have lapsed under the 2013 Act. 
66. 
All such civil appeals are accordingly allowed, the impugned 
judgment of the High Court in each case is set aside, and the acquisition 
of the respondents’ lands under 1894 Act is consequently upheld.  This 
will, however, not preclude the respondents from recovery of the 
compensation amount, if not already paid or to the extent it is not paid, 
along with interest and other statutory benefits under 1894 Act.  
Similarly, they shall be at liberty to seek reference under Section 18 of 
the 1894 Act in accordance with law.  The Government of NCT of Delhi 
and its authorities are directed to take physical possession of the lands 
falling under this category (i.e., ‘List-E.2’), if not already taken and 
continue uninterruptedly to complete the public infrastructure projects. 
67. 
Similarly, we find on perusal of the record that the cases which 
we have included in the appended ‘List-C.1’ are covered by the ratio of 
KL Rathi (supra) and are disposed of accordingly. As regards to the 
cases which form part of ‘List-C.2’, it appears that the Review Petitions 
and Miscellaneous Applications are based on grounds other than 

 
 
 
106
change of law. Such Review Petitions and Miscellaneous Applications 
are required to be examined on a case-to-case basis. Accordingly, these 
cases are also de-tagged and ordered to be listed separately on 
22.07.2024. 
68. 
Likewise, we have identified the cases enlisted as D.1, which fall 
within the four corners of our analysis in GNCTD v. BSK Realtors.49 
All these cases are, therefore, disposed of by invoking our powers under 
Article 142 of the Constitution in terms of the directions issued in BSK 
Realtors (supra). On the same analogy, there are cases included in 
‘List-D.2’, where the impugned judgements have been already set aside 
in the previous rounds of litigation. All these matters have thus been 
rendered infructuous. Ordered accordingly. 
69. 
It has also been brought to our notice that in some of the cases 
(see ‘List-E.1’) notice was issued only on delay and not on merits. Since 
delay has now been condoned, we direct that let notice be issued in 
these petitions on merits, returnable on 22.07.2024. 
70. 
 At this stage, we may hasten to add that the cases mentioned in 
the appended ‘List-A’ contain allegations of fraud against the 
landowners. As discussed in paragraph 21, given that a detailed fact-
finding inquiry is necessary to ascertain the rightful title-holder and the 
                                                
49 SLP(C) Diary No. 17623/2021. 

 
 
 
107
claimant of receiving the compensation, we hereby set aside the orders 
of the High Court that are under challenge in these civil appeals or in 
the civil appeals out of which the subject Review Petitions or 
Miscellaneous Applications have arisen. We revive the relevant writ 
petitions, which shall stand restored on the file of the High Court. After 
deciding the question of suppression of facts, the High Court shall 
proceed to dispose of the cases on merits, in terms of our dictum in 
these batch of cases. 
71. 
In this regard, the Hon’ble Chief Justice of the High Court of Delhi 
is requested to constitute a dedicated bench to decide these writ 
petitions in the manner indicated hereafter. The nominated bench will 
accord an opportunity to the landowners/subsequent purchasers and 
the appellants herein to submit additional documents on affidavits 
whereupon such bench shall embark on an exercise to decide who 
between the landowner(s) and the subsequent purchaser(s) is the 
rightful claimant to receive compensation. The nominated bench will 
have the authority to obtain independent fact-finding enquiry reports, 
if deemed necessary. The inquiry could include determination as to 
whether after the notification under Section 4(1) of the 1894 Act, any 
transfer could have been effected and if so, whether such transfer is 
permitted by law. Once compensation is determined, the relevant 
authority in the land acquisition department shall deposit the same 

 
 
 
108
with the Reference Court. The Reference Court shall then invest the 
deposited amount in a short-term interest-bearing fixed deposit account 
with a nationalized bank, ensuring its periodical renewal until the 
relevant writ petition is disposed of by the nominated bench. Release of 
the invested amount together with the accrued interest to the rightful 
claimant will be contingent upon the decision of the High Court. 
72. 
Lastly, we find that there are some cases which are included in 
‘List-E.3’ where the appellants not only failed to take possession of the 
acquired land but also did not pay any compensation. Consequently, 
the appellants cannot seek protection under Manoharlal (supra). At 
the same time, we are of the considered view that it would not subserve 
any public interest at large, given the unique situation at hand, if the 
government were to be required to fulfill all the conditions for a fresh 
acquisition under the 2013 Act. As analyzed before under the Head: 
Public interest and justice of this judgment, substantial harm would 
ensue towards the public at large if the acquisition proceedings are not 
concluded promptly.  
73. 
To prevent such an outcome and after considering the unique 
facts and circumstances of this batch of cases, we deem it fit to exercise 
our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution in the interests of 
doing complete justice. We accordingly issue the following directions for 
all the cases mentioned in ‘List-E.3’: 

 
 
 
109
(a) 
The time limit for initiation of fresh acquisition proceedings 
in terms of the provisions contained in section 24(2) of the 2013 
Act is extended by a year starting from 01st August, 2024 
whereupon compensation to the affected landowners may be paid 
in accordance with law, failing which consequences, also as per 
law, shall follow; 
(b) 
The 
parties 
shall 
maintain 
status 
quo 
regarding 
possession, change of land use, and creation of third-party rights 
till fresh acquisition proceedings, as directed above, are 
completed; 
(c) 
Since the respondent land-owners are not primarily 
dependent upon the subject lands as their source of sustenance 
and most of these lands were/are under use for other than 
agricultural purposes, we deem it appropriate to invoke our 
powers under Article 142 of the Constitution and dispense with 
the compliance of Chapters II and III of the 2013 Act, whereunder 
it is essential to prepare a Social Impact Assessment Study Report 
and / or to develop alternative multi-crop irrigated agricultural 
land. We do so to ensure that the timeline of one year extended at 
(a) above to complete the acquisition process can be adhered to by 
the appellants and the GNCTD, which would also likely be 
beneficial for the expropriated land owners;  

 
 
 
110
(d) 
Similarly, compliance with Sections 13, 14, and 16 to 20 of 
2013 Act can be dispensed with as the subject-lands are 
predominantly urban/semi-urban in nature and had earlier been 
acquired for public purposes of paramount importance. In order 
to simplify the compliance of direction at (a) above, it is further 
directed that every Notification issued under Section 4(1) of the 
1894 Act in this batch of cases shall be treated as a Preliminary 
Notification within the meaning of Section 11 of the 2013 Act, and 
shall be deemed to have been published as on 01.01.2014;    
(e) 
The Collector shall provide hearing of objections as per 
Section 15 of the 2013 Act without insisting for any Social Impact 
Assessment Report and shall, thereafter, proceed to take 
necessary steps as per the procedure contemplated under Section 
21 onwards of Chapter-IV of the 2013 Act, save and except where 
compliance of any provision has been expressly or impliedly 
dispensed with;   
(f) 
The land-owners may submit their objections within a 
period of four weeks from the date of pronouncement of this 
Order. Such objections shall not question the legality of the 
acquisition process and shall be limited only to clauses (a) and (b) 
of Section 15(1) of the 2013 Act;  

 
 
 
111
(g) 
The Collector shall publish a public notice on his website 
and also in one English and one vernacular newspaper, within 
two weeks of expiry of the period granted under direction (f) above, 
so as to accord personal hearing to all the persons interested in 
the land under acquisition in terms of Section 21(1) of the 2013 
Act. Such hearing shall also be restricted only to the nature of 
objections as per direction (f) above and/or the determination of 
compensation for the acquired land;  
(h) 
The Collector shall, thereafter, pass an award as early as 
possible but not exceeding six months, regardless of the 
maximum period of twelve months contemplated under Section 
25 of the 2013 Act. The market value of the land shall be assessed 
as on 01.01.2014 and the compensation shall be awarded along 
with all other monetary benefits in accordance with the provisions 
of the 2013 Act except the claim like rehabilitation etc.; 
(i) 
The Collector shall consider all the parameters prescribed 
under Section 28 of the 2013 Act for determining the 
compensation for the acquired land. Similarly, the Collector shall 
determine the market value of the building or assets attached with 
the land in accordance with Section 29 of the 2013 Act, and shall 
further award solatium in accordance with Section 30 of the 2013 
Act; 

 
 
 
112
(j) 
In the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, since 
it is difficult to reverse the clock back, the compliance of Chapter 
(V) pertaining to “Rehabilitation and Resettlement Award” is 
hereby dispensed with; and 
(k) 
 The expropriated land-owners shall be entitled to seek 
reference for enhancement of compensation in accordance with 
Chapter-VIII of the 2013 Act. 
74. 
Finally, apart from the aforementioned segregation of cases, the 
present batch of matters also includes SLP(C) No. 14308/2020 (Ashok 
Pratap Singh v. GNCTD) that has been filed by the landowner seeking 
altogether different relief. Accordingly, this case is ordered to be de-
tagged and listed separately on 22.07.2024. 
75. 
Before parting, we deem it appropriate to provide a cautionary 
note that the limited fact-finding conducted by this Court may not be 
entirely accurate due to the complex nature of cases involving 
subsequent sale transactions, earlier rounds of litigation, land titles, 
and status of compensation and/or possession. We accordingly grant 
liberty to the parties to approach the High Court if any factual disputes 
arise in future or if further clarification is required, and the High Court 
shall decide such cases based on the principles outlined above, taking 
into account the facts and, if necessary, the merits of the case. 

 
 
 
113
76. 
It is also needless to clarify that the High Court shall proceed to 
decide the cases remitted to it as expeditiously as possible, but subject 
to its convenience, in accordance with law. 
77. 
All the matters stand disposed of in aforementioned terms.
