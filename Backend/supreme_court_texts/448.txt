2. 
This batch of 47 appeals involves common 
questions of law. They arise from the judgments 
of the Division Bench of the High Court of 
Judicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur Bench, 
Jaipur. The main appeal, namely, Civil Appeal 
7906 of 2010 (Mahesh Chand Bareth & Anr. Vs. 
State of Rajasthan & Ors.) (hereinafter referred to 
as ‘Mahesh Chand Bareth’) arises out of a 
judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court 
of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur Bench, 
Jaipur in D.B. Civil Special Appeal No. 402 of 
2009 dated 21.05.2010. The other matters arise 
out of the same batch as Mahesh Chand Bareth 
or out of the judgments relying on Mahesh 
Chand Bareth or based on the judgments which, 
in turn, relied on Mahesh Chand Bareth. By 
virtue of the said judgments, the appellants were 
denied relief. The appellants challenged the 

4 
 
selection 
of 
candidates 
to 
the 
post 
of 
“Prabodhak” (teacher) by virtue of advertisement 
issued on 31.05.2008. Recruitment and other 
service conditions for the post of Prabodhak are 
governed by the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj 
Prabodhak Service Rules, 2008 (hereinafter 
referred to as the ‘Rules’).  
3. 
About 20060 vacancies were advertised and the 
vacancies came to be filled up soon thereafter. The 
grievance 
of 
the 
appellants 
is 
that 
their 
candidature should also be considered for the 
appointment on the post of ‘Prabodhak’, by 
adopting similar criteria in the grant of bonus 
marks for teaching experience as was done in the 
case of the applicants who had experience of 
working in Government educational projects. 
Their further grievance is that Rule 13(v) of the 
Rules insofar as it provides for age relaxation to 
those persons serving under educational projects 

5 
 
is a provision which is unconstitutional and 
invalid.  
Background facts: 
4. 
A brief narration of the background facts is 
essential for appreciating the issues involved in 
this case. The Shiksha Karmi Project was a 
unique initiative launched in the State of 
Rajasthan in 1987 with assistance from the 
Swedish International Development Cooperation 
Agency (SIDA). The object was to seek to reach out 
to children in remote rural areas where the formal 
primary schools are either not in existence or 
dysfunctional. Local youth with some basic 
educational qualifications were identified, trained 
and provided continuous educational support to 
teach children in Shiksha Karmi Day Schools, 
Prehar Pathshalas (Schools of convenient timings) 
and Angan Pathshalas (Courtyard Schools).   
 

6 
 
5. 
The concept of Shiksha Karmi Project (as is clear 
to us from the document containing a study, 
placed on record by the appellants) indicates that 
the Shiksha Karmi Project rested on the 
assumption that barefoot teachers belonging to 
the local community, who enjoy local community 
support if intensively trained, can overcome lack 
of formal educational qualification.  
6. 
They were selected through an established 
procedure laid out in the manuals and once the 
Gram Sabha voted on the creation of a Shiksha 
Karmi School, spot tests were held to identify 
Shiksha Karmis. The Shiksha Karmi Project had 
significant overlaps with the Lok Jumbish Project 
and the District Primary Education Programme 
(DPEP).  
7. 
The Shiksha Karmi Project was fairly successful 
in reaching out to children from disadvantaged 
communities. A person serving in various 

7 
 
educational projects possessed rich experience of 
teaching and motivating people for education in 
rural areas. The workers were engaged in the 
name of Shiksha Karmis to address the problem 
of teacher absenteeism, poor enrolment, high 
dropout 
trends 
and 
inadequate 
access 
to 
education.  The workers were to get only a fixed 
honorarium. The projects were introduced to 
accelerate 
universalization 
of 
elementary 
education. 
After 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
83rd 
Constitutional Amendment and the setting up of 
an elected Panchayat structure, the project 
worked in tandem with the elected representative 
members of the Panchayat.  
Formulation of Rules: 
8. 
When matters stood thus, a Cabinet note was 
prepared which set out that to provide access to 
education 
to 
children 
living 
in 
far-flung 
areas/difficult terrain/small villages (Hamlet) 

8 
 
called Dhanis, a new regular cadre in the name of 
Prabodhak and Senior Prabodhak be created. As 
a first step, Section 89 of the Rajasthan 
Panchayati Raj Act, 1994 was amended and in 
89(2)(v) ‘Prabodhak’ and ‘Senior Prabodhak’ were 
added as one of the grades. Section 89(2)(v), (5) & 
6B reads as under: 
“89. Constitution of the Rajasthan Panchayat 
Samiti and Zila Parishad Service. 
 
(2) The Service may be divided into different 
categories, such category being divided into 
different grades, and shall consist of - 
 
(v) Prabodhak and Senior Prabodhak. 
 
(5) All appointed to posts in the service shall be 
made- 
 
(a) by direct recruitment; or 
(b) By promotion ; or 
(c) by transfer. 
 
6B. Appointed on the posts specified in clause 
(v) of Sub-section (2) Shall be made by additional 
Chief Executive Office-cum-District Education 
officer (Elementary-Education) of the District 
concerned in accordance with the rules made in 
this behalf by the State Government, from out of 
persons selected for the posts by the recruitment 
committee constituted by the Government in 
accordance with the rules made by the State 

9 
 
Government in this Behalf: 
 
9. 
Thereafter, in accordance with Section 102 of the 
Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Act, 1994 were framed 
the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Prabodhak Service 
Rules, 2008. Certain relevant clauses of the 
Rules are extracted hereunder:  
“2. Definitions. 
In these rules unless the context otherwise 
requires,- 
 
(c) "Direct recruitment" means recruitment made

Guidelines 
of 
27.05.2008 
& 
advertisement 
of 
31.05.2008: 
10. Before the advertisement was issued on 
31.05.2008, appropriate guidelines were 
formulated on 27.05.2008 for the purpose of 
selection of Prabodhak. The guidelines dealt 
with various aspects including award of 
bonus marks. Among the matters dealt with 
apart from educational qualifications and 
emoluments were also matters pertaining to 
disqualification if the applicant had more 
than two children on or after 01.06.2002; 
disqualification with regard to persons 
having more than one spouse and of persons 
who had obtained dowry during their 
weddings. The guidelines also dealt with the 
requirements with regard to community 
certificate; reservation of 30% for women of 
which 5% was to be for widows; requirements 

13 
 
of age limit and relaxation. One of the clauses 
provided as under : 
“Selection Process: - 
 
Selection will be done entirely through interview for 
which a total of 100 marks have been allotted.  
The classification of these numbers is as follows: -  
General Knowledge – maximum 40 marks 
Personality – maximum 35 marks 
Experience - maximum 25 marks 
A maximum of 10 marks will be given according to 
2 marks per year for a maximum of 5 years of 
teaching/supervision experience. If the experience 
is for the employee receiving honorarium under the 
projects run by the state government, then he will 
be given 5 marks for each academic session, 
maximum 25 marks.” 
 
11. Thereafter, on 31.05.2008, advertisement for 
district-wise 
recruitment 
for 
the 
post 
of 
Prabodhak was issued and selection came to be 
made. The appellants, who are teachers in 
recognized educational institutions filed writ 
petitions aggrieved by the award of excess bonus 
marks for the candidate with project experience. 
In some writ petitions, the age relaxation 
granted to the project employed applicants were 

14 
 
also challenged.  
Contentions of Appellants: 
12. 
The appellants contend that Rule 13 (v) of the 
Rules providing age relaxation only to a few 
categories of teachers of certain government 
projects and denial of the same to other similarly 
situated teachers is discriminatory and violative 
of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Insofar 
as the award of bonus marks is concerned, 
learned counsels relying on Rule 2(k) which 
deals with teaching experience, point out that 
granting additional marks to para teachers 
having teaching experience from government 
projects is ultra vires the Rules. 
13. 
Learned 
counsels 
also 
contend 
that 
the 
advertisement of 31.05.2008 did not sanction 
the grant of bonus marks and the administrative 
guidelines dated 27.05.2008 were not brought in 
public domain.  It was argued that the rules of 

15 
 
the game have been changed after the match has 
begun.  It was contended that if the intention of 
the legislature was to create the said post only 
for para teachers working in project, the same 
would not have been offered to private and other 
teachers at all. Learned counsels further 
contend that the Rules do not provide for grant 
of any bonus marks. Learned counsels for the 
appellants argued that the effect of awarding 
extra bonus marks for project experience has 
the effect of an indirect absorption of all the 
project appointees and this, according to learned 
counsels, was contrary to the Rules. Learned 
counsels for the appellants relied on the 
judgment 
in 
Bedanga 
Talukdar 
vs. 
Saifudaullah Khan & Ors., (2011) 12 SCC 85 
to argue that the selection process should be 
strictly in accordance with the stipulated 
selection procedure.  Learned counsels also 

16 
 
cited State of Maharashtra vs. Raj Kumar, 
(1982) 3 SCC 313.   
Contentions of the State:  
14. The State contended that there was a historical 
background to the introduction of the Rules; that 
there was a laudable objective of achieving the 
universalization of elementary education and 
such educational projects initiatives had led to 
significant increase in literacy rate in Rajasthan 
from 38% to 66% between 1991 to 2011; that 
persons who had worked in the aforesaid 
educational 
projects 
were 
having 
valuable 
experience working in far flung areas and had 
direct interaction and connection with children. 
That the projects were started to mitigate the 
absenteeism of teachers in the rural areas 
especially in small villages. Added to this, there 
were dropouts from schools and to tackle all these 
several initiatives in the form of educational 

17 
 
projects were introduced.  
15. According to the State, ‘Prabodhak’ was to 
facilitate and encourage children to attend 
schools. The State contended that as part of the 
selection process guidelines for the purpose of 
giving marks for experience can always be legally 
prescribed. 
All 
the 
Prabodhaks 
who 
were 
recruited possessed the minimum educational 
qualification and according to the State that was 
clear from the advertisement, which contained a 
specific clause with regard to the minimum 
qualification of Basic School Teaching Certificate 
(BSTC) for primary and Bachelor of Education 
(B.Ed) for imparting education for middle school 
students.  
16. The State contended that the experience gained in 
the projects has reasonable nexus with the 
concept of Prabodhak for which the newly framed 
Prabodhak Rules and Cadre were created. Insofar 

18 
 
as 
age 
relaxation 
was 
concerned, 
it 
was 
contended by the State that it was meant for 
persons who worked in the projects after joining 
within the age limit but have now become over 
age. According to the State, the idea was not to 
oust from consideration these persons who had 
worked in the education projects for significant 
number of years. Hence age relaxation was 
provided to them. According to the State, there 
was nothing discriminatory about it. In support of 
the submission, learned counsels for the State 
relied on Satya Dev Bhagaur & Ors. Vs. The 
State of Rajasthan & Ors., (2022) 5 SCC 314. 
17.  The learned Single Judge and the Division Bench 
declined relief to the appellants. Aggrieved the 
appellants are before us. We have also heard the 
learned counsels for the parties proposing to 
implead or intervene.   
 

19 
 
Questions for consideration: 
18. The two questions that arise for consideration 
are: 
i. 
Is Rule 13(v) of the Rules, insofar as it 
provides age relaxation to the persons 
serving 
under 
educational 
projects 
discriminatory and contrary to Article 14 
of the Constitution of India? 
ii. 
Is the award of bonus marks to the project 
employed applicants discriminatory and 
ultra vires the Rules? Are the guidelines of 
27.05.2008 sanctioning the award of 
bonus marks on a differential basis for 
applicants with project experience and 
other applicants invalid for any other 
reason? 
Question No. 1: 
19. To answer this, a full look at Rule 13 is essential:  
“13. Age. 

20 
 
A candidate for direct recruitment to a post 
enumerated in the Schedule must have attained the 
age of 23 years and must not have attained the age 
of 35 years on the first day of January following the 
last date fixed for receipt of applications : 
Provided - 
(i) 
that the upper age limit mentioned above, 
shall be relaxed by 5 years in the case of male 
candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes, 
Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward 
classes. 
(ii) 
that the upper age limit mentioned above shall 
be relaxed by 5 years in case of women 
candidates belonging to General Category. 
(iii) that the upper age limit mentioned above shall 
be relaxed by 10 years in the case of women 
candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes, 
Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward 
classes. 
(iv) 
that the upper age limit mentioned above shall 
be 50 years in the case of Ex-service personnel 
and the reservists, namely the Defence Service 
Personnel who were transferred to the reserve. 
(v) 
that the person serving under the educational 
project 
in 
the 
State 
viz 
Rajiv 
Gandhi 
Pathshala/Shiksha 
Karmi 
Board/Lok 
Jumbish 
Pariyojana/Sarva 
Shiksha 
Abhiyan/District 
Primary 
Education 
Programme shall be deemed to be within age 
limit, had they been within the age limit when 
they were initially engaged even though they 
may have crossed the age limit at the time of 
direct recruitment. 
(vi) 
that the upper age limit mentioned above shall 
be relaxed by a period equal to the service 
rendered in the NCC in the case of Cadet 
instructors and if the resultant age does not 
exceed the prescribed maximum age limit by 
more than three years, they shall be deemed 
to be within the prescribed age limit. 
(vii) that the Released Emergency Commissioned 
Officers and Short Service Commissioned 
Officers after release from the Army shall be 

21 
 
deemed to be within the age limit even though 
they have crossed the age limit when they 
appear before the Committee had they been 
eligible as such at the time of their joining the 
Commission in the Army. 
(viii) that there shall be no upper age limit in the 
case of widows and divorced women.” 
 
20. 
Fixing 
of 
minimum 
and 
maximum 
age 
requirement is a policy decision. In this case, the 
said decision is engrafted in Rule 13. A careful 
perusal of the Rule reveals that the minimum 
age required was 23 years and the maximum 
outer limit was 35 years. In the proviso there are 
several categories to which relaxation has been 
granted. Under clause (i) of the proviso, a 
relaxation of 5 years is granted to male 
candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes, 
Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward 
classes. Under clause (ii) of the proviso, the 
upper age limit is relaxed by 5 years in case of 
women 
candidates 
belonging 
to 
General 
Category and under clause (iii) it is relaxed by 10 
years in the case of women candidates belonging 

22 
 
to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and 
the Other Backward classes. Under Clause (iv), 
the age relaxation is of 50 years in the case of 
Ex-service Personnel and the reservists, namely 
the Defence Service Personnel who were 
transferred to the reserve.  
21. Thereafter, we have clause (v) which states that 
the person serving under the educational project 
in 
the 
State, 
namely, 
Rajiv 
Gandhi 
Pathshala/Shiksha Karmi Board/Lok Jumbish 
Pariyojana/Sarva 
Shiksha 
Abhiyan/District 
Primary Education Programme shall be deemed to 
be within age limit, had they been within the age 
limit when they were initially engaged even 
though they may have crossed the age limit at the 
time of direct recruitment. Thereafter, we have 
clause (vi) which states that the upper age limit 
mentioned above shall be relaxed by a period 
equal to the service rendered in the NCC in the 

23 
 
case of Cadet instructors and if the resultant age 
does not exceed the prescribed maximum age 
limit by more than three years, they shall be 
deemed to be within the prescribed age limit. In 
clause 
(vii) 
the 
Released 
Emergency 
Commissioned 
Officers 
and 
Short 
Service 
Commissioned Officers after release from the 
Army shall be deemed to be within the age limit 
even though they have crossed the age limit when 
they appear before the Committee had they been 
eligible as such at the time of their joining the 
Commission in the Army. So finally in clause (viii) 
it is provided that there shall be no upper age limit 
in the case of widows and divorced women. 
22. The challenge of the appellants is only to sub 
clause (v). We find that the provisions generally 
including sub clause (v) are not arbitrary or 
discriminatory. Insofar as the clause (v) is 
concerned, as has been mentioned hereinabove, 

24 
 
the 
historical 
background 
leading 
to 
the 
enactment 
of 
the 
Rules 
itself 
provides 
a 
justification for granting relaxation to the persons 
serving under the educational project, if they fulfil 
the condition that they were within the age limit 
when they were initially engaged.  
23. As the counter affidavit of the State indicates that 
the projects were designed to deal with absentee 
teachers in the far flung areas which was causing 
a serious jeopardy to the education of the rural 
children. The para teachers, as they were called, 
worked under difficult circumstances. They had 
the advantage of interacting personally with the 
children of the far-flung areas. They only received 
an honorarium. The projects themselves played a 
large part in uplifting the elementary education 
programme in the State. The para teachers 
motivated the children to come to school. It was 
in this background that the grade of ‘Prabodhak’ 

25 
 
and Senior ‘Prabodhak’ were encadred and 
separate rules enacted. 
24. No doubt, under the Rules, opportunity to apply 
was also given to all those who possess the 
essential qualifications and who had teaching 
experience 
in 
any 
recognized 
educational 
institutions apart from the educational projects. 
This, however, does not mean that those who 
served in projects did not form a separate class. 
There was a valid classification based on 
intelligible 
differentia 
which 
distinguished 
applicants with project experience and those who 
lacked project experience. Further the differentia 
had a rational relation to the object sought to be 
achieved by the Rules.  In fact, the job of a 
Prabodhak was exactly the job that the para 
teachers carried out in the projects and if the 
Government felt that the experience gained by 
them should not be lost and in that regard 

26 
 
granted them age relaxation, provided they fulfil 
the condition of being within the age limit at the 
time of their initial appointment in the project, no 
fault can be found with the same.  
25. Dealing with the similar challenge in Union of 
India & Ors v. Shivbachan Rai, (2001) 9 SCC 
356, this Court held that the prescribing of any 
age limit for a given post, as also deciding the 
extent to which any relaxation can be given to the 
said age limit are essentially matters of policy. It 
was further held that it was open for the 
Government while framing the rules to prescribe 
such age limits or to prescribe the extent to which 
any relaxation can be given. Applying the said 
principle to this case, we find that the relaxation 
provided for in Rule 13(v) is not arbitrary or 
unreasonable.  
 
 

27 
 
Question No.2: 
26. Insofar as the award of bonus marks is 
concerned, a careful perusal of the guidelines 
indicates 
that 
it 
was 
issued 
before 
the 
advertisement and all that it provided was out of 
the allotted maximum marks of 25 for the 
experience, ordinarily 2 marks were to be given 
for every year with a cap of 10 marks. However, if 
the experience is for the employee receiving 
honorarium under the projects run by the State 
Government, then he was to be given 5 marks for 
each academic session with the maximum of 25 
marks. Even if part of the experience was in a 
project to that extent extra marks were provided 
to all the applicants.  
27. In the application form, there was a specific 
column, namely, column fourteen which asked 
about details of the experience. The form also 
asked for the name of the employer and the 

28 
 
address of the institution employed. Thereafter, 
there was another column asking for the post in 
which they were employed and the period during 
which the emoluments were received.  
28. Apart from this, the justification offered for 
defending the age relaxation is also available for 
the grant of excess bonus marks. In fact, as is 
clear from the background set out above, the 
creation of the post of ‘Prabodhak’ and ‘Senior 
Prabodhak’ was to get the advantage of the 
benefits that the projects gave to the State.  At the 
same time, opportunity was given to all, with the 
only difference being that by an executive 
instruction additional marks were granted for 
project experience. The executive guidelines only 
supplemented the Rules and did not supplant 
them.  
29. Moreover, intrinsically from Rule 13(v) the validity 
of which we have upheld, evidence is available to 

29 
 
show that the Rule recognized the experience 
gathered from project work stood on a higher 
pedestal because it was in tune with the nature of 
the work of Prabodhak. Further, under Rule 25, 
the Committee was to prepare a list of candidates 
whom they consider suitable for appointment.  
30. In Srinivas K. Gouda v. Karnataka Institute of 
Medical Sciences and Others (2022) 1 SCC 49, 
a notification was issued inviting applications for 
the post of Junior Lab Technician. Eligibility and 
requirements were prescribed. At the time of 
selection, the Selection Committee decided that 
out of the 15% marks for interview, 10% of the 
marks were to be set apart for the length of work 
experience and/or additional training in teaching 
hospitals of the medical college, with special 
preference to those who had worked in teaching 
hospitals of Government/autonomous medical 
colleges and the remaining 5% marks were to be 

30 
 
assigned to the personality of the candidates 
based on viva voice. In the minutes, it was set out 
as under:  
“4.  …. It was decided that in order to select the 
most 
suitable 
candidates, 
proportionate 
weightage based on the length of experience 
and/or additional training to the extent of 10 
marks be given to those candidates who had work 
experience and/or additional training in medical 
college teaching hospitals and especially those 
who had worked in government/autonomous 
medical college teaching hospitals. It was agreed 
that the type of work in these institutions most 
closely resembled the working conditions at 
Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences, Hubli 
and hence the candidates who had experience in 
such institutions would be the most suitable. It 
was also decided to set apart a maximum of 5 
marks for the personality of the candidate and 
his/her presentation and performance….” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
31. The appellant in that case was selected and the 
selection had been set aside by the Division Bench 
of the High Court. The appellant secured 9.5 
marks in the experience category while the writ 
petitioner who had challenged his appointment 
had secured one (1) mark under the component 
of experience. On appeal, the appellant contended 

31 
 
that the selection committee, an expert body, was 
entitled to apportion marks, and that the 
appellant 
had 
experience 
in 
Government/Autonomous medical institutions. 
The writ petitioner had contended that no 
explanation was furnished for dividing the marks 
and bifurcating the same. This Court while 
allowing the appeal in para 19 held as under:  
“19. It is in this background that we need to 
determine whether the marks allotted to the 
appellant in the category of experience and 
personality are arbitrary. The appellant at the 
time of submitting the application had a one year 
work experience in Bapuji Medical College, 
Devanagere (a private institution) and three years 
of work experience with the first respondent. On 
the other hand, the respondent at the time of the 
application, had six months’ experience of 
working under a doctor who was undertaking 
private practice. Not only did the appellant have 
more years of work experience, he had work 
experience in a governmental institution. Hence, 
the marks awarded to the third respondent and 
the appellant bore a nexus to the yardstick 
determined by the Selection Committee. It is not 
the case of the third respondent that the 
appellant was given more marks for experience 
despite having less work experience. On a 
comparison of the marks allotted to both the 
candidates with reference to the yardstick 

32 
 
determined by the Selection Committee, no mala 
fides 
could 
be 
imputed 
to 
the 
Selection 
Committee. Nor is there an obvious or glaring 
error or perversity. The Court does not sit in 
appeal over the decision of the Selection 
Committee.” 
 
32. In the present case too, we find no glaring error or 
perversity in the criterion adopted on the peculiar 
facts of the present case.  No mala fide could also 
be attributed to the State and the Selection 
Committee.  
33. Satya Dev Bhagaur (supra) was a case wherein 
the State of Rajasthan had issued a notification 
providing that such of the candidate who had 
worked under the Government, Chief Minister 
BPL Life Saving Fund, NRHM Medicare Relief 
Society, AIDS Control Society, National TB 
Control Program, Jhalawar Hospital and Medical 
College Society, Samekit Rog Nirgrani Pariyojna or 
State Institute of Health Family Welfare would be 
entitled to bonus marks as per the experience 
attained. It was provided that for one year of 

33 
 
experience, the bonus marks will be 10, for two 
years of experience the bonus marks will be 20 
and for three years of experience it will be 30. This 
notification was challenged by certain persons 
who had experience of working in NRHM Scheme 
on contract basis in States other than Rajasthan. 
They sought a direction to accept their experience 
certificate so as to entitle them to obtain the 
bonus marks. While the Single Judge allowed the 
Writ Petitions, the Division Bench reversed the 
same and the aggrieved Writ Petitioners were in 
Appeal. Examining the question whether bonus 
marks would be available to employees of NRHM 
Scheme in other States, this Court while repelling 
the contention held that in matters of policy, 
Courts should be slow in interfering, unless the 
policy is found to be palpably discriminatory and 
arbitrary. It was further held that the court would 
not interfere with the policy decision when the 

34 
 
State was in a position to point out that there was 
an intelligible differentia in the application of the 
policy and that such intelligible differentia had a 
nexus with the object sought to be achieved. On 
the facts of that case, the Court held as follows:  
“20. It could thus clearly be seen that the Division 
Bench in Jagdish Prasad [Jagdish Prasad v. State 
of Rajasthan, 2016 SCC OnLine Raj 646] after 
considering the record, has come to the finding 
that the Government of Rajasthan has conducted 
several training programmes for the persons 
working with it on contractual basis, as well as 
under 
different 
schemes. 
The 
training 
programmes mainly pertain to the peculiar 
working pattern in the rural areas of the State of 
Rajasthan including tribal and arid zones. The 
Division Bench has further come to a finding that 
participation in such a training is mandatory and 
non-joining of the same would result in non-
renewal of service contracts. It has been held that 
persons having special knowledge in working in 
the State of Rajasthan form a class different than 
the persons not having such experience of working 
in the State. It was found that the benefit extended 
by the State policy was only that of giving a little 
more weightage on the basis of experience and all 
the candidates were required to undergo the rigor 
of selection process. The Division Bench has 
clearly held that the experienced candidates in 
other States cannot be compared with the 
candidates working in the State of Rajasthan, as 
every State has its own problems and issues and 
the persons trained to meet such circumstances, 

35 
 
stand on a different pedestal.” 
 
 
34. We find that the ratio laid down in the said 
judgment is applicable to the facts of the present 
case also to uphold the action of the State.  
35. The judgment of this Court in Raj Kumar (supra) 
cited by the learned counsel for the appellants is 
clearly distinguishable. That case dealt with the 
Rule which provided that any person who has 
passed the SSC examination and is supposed to 
be a rural candidate was to be given weightage by 
the Public Service Commission by awarding 10% 
marks in each subject for such a candidate. It was 
also provided that the Viva Voce Board was to put 
relevant questions to judge the suitability of the 
candidate for working in rural areas and to test 
whether or not they had sufficient knowledge of 
rural problems. Rural candidate was defined to 
mean a candidate who comes from the rural area 
and who has passed SSC examination which is 

36 
 
held from a village or a town having only a ‘C’ type 
Municipality. The purported object of the Rule 
was to take officers who had full knowledge of 
rural life, its problems, aptitudes and working of 
the people in villages. This Court held that the 
Rule did not fulfil or carry out the object sought 
to be achieved since as the Rules stood any 
person who may not have lived in a village at all 
can appear for SSC Examination from a village 
and yet become eligible for selection. The Court 
found that there was no nexus between the 
classification and the object sought to be 
achieved. The Court also faulted the weightage 
marks given by holding that since in the viva voce 
questions to judge the suitability of the candidate 
for working in rural areas were anyway being put, 
there was absolutely no occasion for giving 
weightage which would convert demerit into merit 
and merit into demerit. On the facts of that case, 

37 
 
the Court found the rule of weightage to be 
manifestly unreasonable and wholly arbitrary. 
The said case has no application to the facts of 
the present case. 
36.  Equally the judgment in Kailash Chand 
Sharma vs State of Rajasthan & Ors., (2002) 
6 SCC 562 has also no application. This Court in 
that case held that the award of bonus marks to 
the residents of the district and residents of the 
rural 
areas 
of 
the 
district 
amounts 
to 
impermissible discrimination. The Court found 
that there was no rational basis for such 
preferential treatment on the material placed 
before the Court. The Court found that the 
ostensible reasons advanced by the State were 
non-existent or irrelevant, having no nexus with 
the object sought to be achieved. It also found that 
no criteria was set out for determining as to 
residents in rural areas. The Court in Kailash 

38 
 
Chand Sharma (supra) followed the judgment in 
Raj Kumar (Supra).  
37. The 
judgment 
in 
Official 
Liquidator 
vs. 
Dayanand & Ors. (2008) 10 SCC 1 cited by the 
appellants has no connection at all with the 
issues raised in the present case. Yet another case 
cited by the appellants is Bedanga Talukdar 
(supra). The appellants relied on the said 
judgment to contend that there could be no 
relaxation in the terms and conditions contained 
in the advertisement and even if there was power 
of relaxation the same will have to be specifically 
indicated in the advertisement. The case is wholly 
inapplicable. 
In 
this 
case, 
before 
the 
advertisement was issued, the guidelines setting 
out various aspects including the aspect of bonus 
marks were issued and, as discussed earlier, no 
infirmity can be found with the same.  
 

39 
 
38. Similarly, the judgment in State of Rajasthan 
vs. Archana (2017) 11 SCC 421 and the 
judgment in Civil Appeal 12335 of 2016 dated 
18.01.2022 in Manoj Kumar Acharya vs. 
State of Rajasthan & Ors., cited by the State 
have no application to the facts of the present 
case.     
39. The argument that the guideline was not in public 
domain was not an argument canvassed either 
before the learned Single Judge or before the 
Division Bench.  In any event, the contention does 
not impress us on the facts of the present case. 
The guideline setting out the selection process 
was issued before the advertisement and it was 
applied uniformly and across the board to all the 
applicants. No prejudice has been caused to the 
applicants even assuming that the guideline was 
not in the public domain. It was a procedure 
adopted by the recruiting Authority and endorsed 

40 
 
by the Selection Committee.  The appellants have 
had the opportunity to assail the validity of the 
prescription of the award of bonus marks and as 
such have had a fora to ventilate their grievance. 
They have failed in the process. Hence, we cannot 
jettison the guideline on the alleged ground that 
it was not in public domain.  Equally, since the 
guidelines 
of 
27.05.2008 
preceded 
the 
advertisement of 31.05.2008, there is no merit in 
the argument feebly advanced that the rules of the 
game had been changed after the match had 
begun.  
40. 
On the special facts of this case, considering the 
peculiarity that obtained in the State of 
Rajasthan with regard to absentee teachers and 
drop out of students and the introduction of the 
projects with para legals to address the 
situation, we find no illegality in the prescription 
of additional marks for those applicants who 

41 
 
had experience of working in projects, while 
recruiting Prabhodhaks. The statutory rules in 
Rule 13(v) recognize that project employed 
applicants were a class apart with the idea being 
that their experience should not be wasted. In 
view of the above, we find no illegality in the 
award of bonus marks. 
41. 
In view of the above, we find no merit in the 
appeals and all the appeals are dismissed with 
no order as to costs. All applications for 
impleadment and intervention are closed.
