FACTUAL ASPECTS 
1. 
The Hon’ble President of India executed four separate 
perpetual lease deeds on 12th August 1983 in favour of M/s. 
Jaiprakash Associates Pvt Ltd in respect of the plots more 
particularly described in Schedule-I to the lease deeds (for 
short, ‘the said plots’).  In July 1986, a joint application was 
made by M/s. Jaiprakash Associates Pvt Ltd and M/s. 
Jaypee Rewa Cement Ltd before the High Court of Judicature 
at Allahabad, praying for amalgamation of M/s. Jaiprakash 
Associates Pvt Ltd with M/s. Jaypee Rewa Cement Ltd.  By 
the order dated 30th July 1986, the High Court sanctioned 
the scheme of amalgamation.  The said plots were included 
in the Schedule of the properties to the scheme of

amalgamation.  While passing the order dated 30th July 1986 
approving amalgamation, the High Court directed that the 
properties in Parts I, II and III of Schedule II to the said order 
shall stand vested in the transferee company (M/s. Jaypee 
Rewa Cement Ltd).  After the amalgamation, in September 
1986, the name of M/s. Jaypee Rewa Cement Ltd was 
changed to M/s. Jaiprakash Industries Ltd.  Subsequently, 
the name was changed to M/s. Jaiprakash Associates Ltd, 
which is the present appellant.  Thus, in short, the appellant 
is a company created as a result of the amalgamation of the 
erstwhile M/s. Jaiprakash Associates Pvt Ltd and M/s. 
Jaypee Rewa Cement Ltd.  In short, the present appellant is 
the transferee company. 
2. 
An application was made by the appellant to the 
respondent-Delhi Development Authority (for short, ‘DDA’) 
for a grant of permission to mortgage the said plots in favour 
of the Industrial Finance Corporation of India.  By the letter 
dated 14th March 1991, the respondent-DDA demanded an 
unearned increase value of Rs.2,13,59,511.20.  Being 
aggrieved by the said demand, representations were made by 
the appellant which were not favourably considered by the 
respondent-DDA.  Therefore, the appellant filed a writ 
petition before a learned Single Judge of the High Court of 
Delhi.  By the order dated 30th January 2003, the learned 
Single Judge dismissed the said petition filed by the appellant 
by relying upon a decision a Division Bench of the same High 
Court in the case of Indian Shaving Products Limited v. 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009

Delhi Development Authority & Anr.1  Being aggrieved by 
the decision of the learned Single Judge, the appellant 
preferred an appeal before a Division Bench of the High Court 
of Delhi.  By the impugned judgment, the said appeal had 
also been dismissed. 
SUBMISSIONS 
3. 
The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant 
invited our attention to clause II(4)(a) of the lease deed, which 
puts an embargo on the lessee not to sell, transfer, assign or 
otherwise part with the possession of the whole or any part 
of the said plots except with the previous consent in writing 
from the lessor.  The proviso to the said clause entitled the 
lessor to impose a condition while granting consent, of 
payment of a portion of the unearned increase in the value 
(i.e. the difference between the premium paid and the market 
value).  He submitted that the amalgamation of the lessee 
with another company under the orders of the Company 
Court will not amount to the sale, transfer or assignment of 
the said plots.  His submission is that in the case of Indian 
Shaving Products Limited1, the High Court had dealt with 
a completely different set of factual and legal nuances.  In the 
said case, the submission of the petitioner was that Section 
32 of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 
1985 (for short, ‘SICA’) would have an overriding effect over 
the terms and conditions of the lease deed.  He submitted 
that the merger or amalgamation was taken up in the said 
 
1  2001 SCC Online Del 1123:  2002 1 AD (Del) 175 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009  
 
Page 4 of 18 
 
 
case for rehabilitation of a sick company and that it was a 
distressed company merger. Therefore, the said decision will 
have no application to the facts of this case. 
4. 
 The learned senior counsel for the appellant further 
submitted that the amalgamation or merger of the two 
companies does not involve any transfer within the meaning 
of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (for short, ‘TPA’).  He 
submitted that only in view of the operation of Section 394 of 
the Companies Act, 1956, the assets and liabilities of the 
lessee had merged and devolved on the appellant.  He urged 
that the order sanctioning the scheme of amalgamation is an 
order in rem, which binds everyone.  He pointed out that in 
the scheme of amalgamation, there was no element of sale 
consideration or consideration for transfer.  The learned 
senior counsel submitted that in the scheme subject matter 
of this appeal, the transferor personality ceased to exist and 
merged with the transferee.  The learned senior counsel relied 
upon a decision of the High Court of Delhi in the case of Delhi 
Development Authority v. Nalwa Sons Investment Ltd. & 
Anr2.  He also relied upon a decision of the Division Bench of 
the High Court of Delhi in the case of Vijaya C. Gursahaney 
v. Delhi Development Authority & Ors3. 
5. 
The 
learned 
senior 
counsel 
appearing 
for 
the 
respondent-DDA invited our attention to the order passed by 
the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad on 30th July 1986.  
 
2  (2020) 17 SCC 782 
3  1994 SCC Online Del 306 : 1994 II AD (Delhi) 770 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009  
 
Page 5 of 18 
 
 
He submitted that clause (1) of the order provides that the 
transferor company's properties, rights and powers in respect 
of the property described in the first, second and third parts 
of schedule II shall be transferred without any further act or 
deed to the transferee company.  He would, therefore, submit 
that the demand for unearned increase was lawful. 
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS 
6. 
We 
have 
given 
careful 
consideration 
to 
the 
submissions. In the perpetual leases, clause (II)(4)(a) was 
incorporated, which reads thus: 
“II. The Lessee for himself, his heirs, 
executors, administrators and assigns 
covenants with the Lessor in the 
manner following that is to say:- 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
.. .. .. 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
.. .. .. 
(4) (a) The lessee shall not sell, 
transfer, assign or otherwise part 
with the possession of the whole or 
any part of the commercial plot 
except with the previous consent in 
writing of the lessor which he shall 
be entitled to refuse in his absolute 
discretion. 
Provided that such consent shall not be 
given for a period of ten years from the 
commencement of this Lease unless in 
the opinion of the Lessor, exceptional 
circumstances exist for the grant of 
such consent. 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009  
 
Page 6 of 18 
 
 
Provided further that in the event of 
the consent being given the Lessor 
may 
impose 
such 
terms 
and 
conditions as he thinks fit and the 
Lessor shall be entitled to claim and 
recover a portion of the unearned 
increase in the value (i.e. the 
difference between the premium 
paid and the market value) of the 
plot at the time of sale, transfer, 
assignment, or parting with the 
possession, 
the 
amount 
to 
be 
recovered being fifty percent of the 
unearned increased and the decision 
of the Lessor in respect of the 
market value shall be final and 
binding. 
Provided further that the Lessor shall 
have the pre-emptive right to purchase 
the property after deducting fifty per 
cent of the unearned increase as 
aforesaid.” 
                       (emphasis added) 
The same clause has been incorporated in all four perpetual 
leases with which we are concerned.  Therefore, the perpetual 
leases put an embargo on the lessee selling, transferring, 
assigning or otherwise parting with the possession of the 
whole or any part of the commercial plots except with the 
previous consent of the lessor in writing.  The second proviso 
makes it clear that the respondent-DDA, which has stepped 
into the shoes of the lessor, will be entitled to recover a 
portion of the unearned increase in the value. 
7. 
Now, the question is whether amalgamation will 
amount to transferring the said plots. We have carefully 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009  
 
Page 7 of 18 
 
 
perused the order dated 30th July 1986 of the High Court of 
Judicature at Allahabad sanctioning the scheme of 
amalgamation.  In the said scheme, M/s. Jaiprakash 
Associates Private Ltd (the erstwhile company) was shown as 
the ‘transferor company’ and M/s. Jaypee Rewa Cement Ltd 
was shown as the ‘transferee company’.  Clauses (1) and (2) 
of the operative part of the order dated 30th July 1986 read 
thus: 
“.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
.. .. 
1. 
That all the properties, rights 
and 
powers 
of 
the 
Transferor 
Company specified in the first, 
second and third parts of the 
Schedule II hereto and all other 
properties, rights and powers of the 
Transferor Company be transferred 
without further act or deed to the 
transferee company and accordingly 
the same shall pursuant to section 
394(2) of the Companies Act, 1956 
be transferred to and vest in the 
Transferee Company for all the 
estate and interest of the Transferor 
Company 
therein 
but 
subject, 
nevertheless to all charges now 
affecting the same; and 
2. 
That all the liabilities and duties 
of 
the 
Transferor 
Company 
be 
transferred without further act or deed 
to 
the 
Transferee 
company 
and 
accordingly the same shall pursuant to 
section 394(2) of the Companies Act, 
1956 be transferred to and become the 
liabilities and duties of the transferee 
company, and 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009  
 
Page 8 of 18 
 
 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
..” 
            (emphasis added) 
8. 
The said plots are a part of the Schedule of the 
properties referred to in clause (1).  Thus, there is a specific 
clause in the order of amalgamation which holds that the said 
plots stand transferred from the original permanent lessee to 
the transferee M/s. Jaypee Rewa Cement Ltd, which is now 
known as M/s. Jaiprakash Associates Ltd.  Clause II(4)(a) 
covers all the categories of transfers as it provides that the 
lessee shall not sell, transfer, assign or otherwise part with 
the possession of the whole or any part of the commercial 
plots without the written consent of the lessor.  The said 
clause does not exclude involuntary transfers.  In the facts of 
the case, it cannot be said that there is an involuntary 
transfer, as the transfer is made based on a petition filed by 
the lessee and the transferee for seeking amalgamation. In a 
sense, this is an act done by them of their own volition.   
9. 
A similar issue arose for consideration before this Court 
in the case of Nalwa Sons Investment Ltd2.  The Court was 
dealing with a case where the Company Court passed an 
order of arrangement and demerger.  As a result, the plot 
given on lease to a company was transferred to another 
company.  In paragraph 5 of the decision, this Court had set 
out the policy instructions regarding charging an unearned 
increase.  Paragraph 5 reads thus: 
5. The instructions followed by the 
competent authority in regard to 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009

charging of UEI have been articulated 
in document Annexure P-1, which 
reads thus: 
XXX 
XXX XXX 
Sub. : Substitution/addition/deletion 
of 
names 
in 
lease/sub-lease 
of 
industrial/commercial plots unearned 
increase 
In 
supersession 
of 
previous 
instructions on the subject, the Lt. 
Governor, Delhi is pleased to order that 
henceforth 
in 
the 
matters 
of 
addition/deletion and substitution of 
names 
in 
respect 
of 
industrial/commercial lease/sub-lease 
to be executed or already executed, the 
following procedure shall be followed: 
1. No unearned increase to be charged: 
(a) 
The 
auction-purchaser/allottee 
shall be permitted free of charge, to 
add, delete or substitute the names of 
family members which may, where 
necessary, take the form of partnership 
firm or private limited company. 
(b) In case of conversion of partnership 
firm into private limited company 
comprising 
original 
partners 
as 
Directors/Subscribers/Shareholders. 
(c) In case of addition, deletion or 
substitution of partners in a firm or 
Directors 
and 
conversion 
of 
sole 
proprietorship 
firm 
or 
partnership 
concern into private limited company 
when change in constitution is limited, 
for approval by the DDA, within one 
year from the date of purchase of plot 
in auction. This will to apply in case of 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009

plot obtained by the party by way of 
allotment. 
(d) 
Change 
from 
private 
limited 
company to public limited company 
where 
a private limited company 
becomes a public limited company 
under Section 43-A of the Companies 
Act, 1956. 
2. Where unearned increase is to be 
charged: 
(a) Addition of outsiders not falling 
within the family members shall be 
allowed through a conveyance deed on 
payment of 50% unearned increase on 
his 
proportionate 
shares. 
The 
unearned increase shall be calculated 
at the market rate prevalent on the date 
of receipt of the application in the office 
of the DDA. 
(b) 
Substitution 
of 
the 
original 
allottee/auction-purchasers shall be 
allowed on payment of 50% unearned 
increase of his shares in the value of 
the plot which will be calculated at the 
market rate. The market rate shall be 
the rate prevalent on the date of receipt 
of the application. It is irrespective of 
the fact whether the lease deed has 
been executed or not. 
(c) 50% unearned increase will be 
charged in respect of proportionate 
shares of the plot parted with by way of 
addition, deletion or substitution of 
partner/partners in case of single 
ownership or partnership firm and 
Director/Directors/Shareholders/Sub
scribers in case of private limited 
company. This is applicable where the 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009  
 
Page 11 of 18 
 
 
incoming persons do not fall within the 
definition of family. Unearned increase 
would be charged on the basis of 
market rate prevalent on the date of 
intimation for each and every change in 
the 
constitution. 
This 
would 
be 
applicable in all cases where the lease 
deed has been executed or not. 
(d) In case where a private limited 
company/public limited company 
separately floating a new company 
although Directors may be the same 
and the name of old company has 
not changed and it still exists as it 
was, 50% unearned increase will be 
chargeable in such cases. 
3. Interest @ 18% p.a. on the unearned 
increase from the date of receipt of the 
application intimating the change till 
the payment by the company or 
individual or firm shall be charged on 
the amount of the unearned increase 
payable to the DDA.

The 
administrative 
conditions

will remain unchanged. 
XXX 
XXX XXX” 
             
 
(emphasis added) 
In paragraphs 14 to 18, this Court held thus: 
14. For 
answering 
the 
seminal 
question, we must first advert to the 
obligation of Respondent 1 springing 
from the stipulation in the perpetual 
lease deed. Clause 6(a), as extracted 
in para 2 above, envisages a bar to 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009  
 
Page 12 of 18 
 
 
sell, transfer, assign or otherwise 
part with the possession of the whole 
or any part of the commercial plot, 
except with the previous consent in 
writing of the lessor (appellant), 
which 
the 
appellant 
would 
be 
entitled to refuse in its absolute 
discretion. While granting consent in 
terms of the proviso to Clause 6(a), 
it is open to the appellant to impose 
such terms and conditions as may be 
deemed appropriate and claim and 
recover a portion of the unearned 
increase 
in 
the 
value 
of 
the 
commercial plot, being 50% of the 
unearned increase. The decision of the 
appellant in this behalf is final and 
binding 
upon 
the 
original 
lessee 
(Respondent 1). The amount towards 
the unearned increase is computed on 
the basis of the difference between the 
premium paid and the market value of 
the commercial plot. In doing so, the 
fact 
that 
the 
transfer 
under 
consideration did not involve any 
consideration amount or the value paid 
by the transferee is below the market 
value, would not inhibit recovery of 
50% 
of 
the 
prescribed 
unearned 
increase amount on actual or, in a 
given case, notional basis. This is the 
plain meaning of the stipulation. This 
position 
is 
reinforced 
from 
the 
contemporaneous instructions issued 
by the competent authority of the 
appellant about the manner in which 
the unearned increase should be 
charged and from whom such charges 
should be recovered. That can be 
discerned from the instructions dated 
6-9-1988. 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009  
 
Page 13 of 18 
 
 
15. Indeed, 
the 
said 
instructions 
advert to the category of persons from 
whom no unearned increase should be 
charged, despite being a case of 
transfer of the property as mentioned in 
Clause 1 thereof. The Division Bench of 
the High Court has relied upon the 
category mentioned in Clause 1(b). The 
same reads thus: 
“1. 
No 
unearned 
increase 
to 
be 
charged: 
(a)*** 
(b) In case of conversion of partnership 
firm into private limited company 
comprising 
original 
partners 
as 
Directors/Subscribers/Shareholders.” 
From the plain language of this clause, 
we fail to fathom how the said clause 
will be of any avail to the respondents. 
For, we are not dealing with a case of 
conversion of a partnership firm into a 
private limited company as such. The 
fact that the instructions extricate the 
category of transfers referred to in 
Clause 1 of the instructions from the 
liability of paying an unearned increase 
despite being a case of transfer, cannot 
be the basis to exclude the other 
category 
of 
transfers/persons 
not 
specifically covered by Clause 1, such 
as the case of present respondents. 
That 
is 
a 
policy 
matter. 
The 
respondents were fully aware about the 
existence of such a policy. That policy 
has not been challenged in the writ 
petition. 
Concededly, 
the 
reliefs 
claimed in the writ petition were limited 
to quashing of the demand letter dated 
5-8-2010 and notice dated 31-1-2011, 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009  
 
Page 14 of 18 
 
 
demanding unearned increase; and to 
direct the appellant to convert the said 
property from leasehold to freehold in 
favour 
of 
Respondent 
2, 
without 
charging any unearned increase. The 
reliefs are founded on the assertion 
that the transfer was not to any 
outsider, 
much 
less 
for 
any 
consideration. 
16. In the first place, it is not open 
to the respondents to contend that 
the 
arrangement 
and 
demerger 
scheme does not result in transfer of 
the subject plot from the original 
lessee (Respondent 1) to Respondent 
2. Inasmuch as, Clause (2) of the 
order passed by the Company Judge 
approving the scheme of demerger, 
as reproduced above, makes it amply 
clear that all property, assets, rights 
and 
powers 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
specified properties, including the 
subject plot, shall stand transferred 
to and vest in Respondent 2. Once it 
is a case of transfer, it must abide by 
the stipulation in Clause 6(a) of the 
lease 
deed 
of 
taking 
previous 
consent in writing of the lessor 
(appellant) and to fulfil such terms 
and conditions as may be imposed, 
including to pay 
any unearned 
increase amount. We find force in the 
argument of the appellant that the fact 
situation of the present case would, in 
fact, be governed by Clause 2(d) of the 
instructions which reads thus: 
“2. Where unearned increase is to be 
charged: 
(a)*** 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009  
 
Page 15 of 18 
 
 
(d) In case where a private limited 
company/public limited company 
separately floating a new company 
although Directors may be the 
same and the name of old company 
has not changed and it still exists 
as it was, 50% unearned increase 
will be chargeable in such cases.” 
This clause plainly applies to the 
present 
case. 
The 
demand 
of 
unearned 
increase 
from 
the 
respondents is founded on that 
basis. The High Court misinterpreted 
the said clause and erroneously opined 
that it is not applicable to a case of 
demerger of a public limited company. 
17. The principal clause is Clause 6(a) 
of the lease deed. The clause referred to 
in 
the 
instructions 
is 
equally 
significant. Indeed, the latter merely 
provides for the mechanism to recover 
the unearned increase from the original 
lessee. The fact that the same group of 
persons 
or 
Directors/promoters/ 
shareholders 
would 
be 
and 
are 
associated with the transferee company 
does not cease to be a case of transfer 
or exempted from payment of UEI, as 
envisaged in Clause 6(a) of the lease 
deed. Rather, Clause 2(d) of the policy, 
noted above, makes it expressly clear 
that unearned increase be charged 
irrespective 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Directors 
in 
both 
companies 
are 
common and the old (parent) company 
has not changed its name. 
18. The fact that it was a case of 
transfer is reinforced from the order of 
demerger passed by the Company 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009  
 
Page 16 of 18 
 
 
Judge and once it is a case of transfer, 
coupled 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
respondents are not covered within the 
categories specified in Clauses 1(a) to 
1(d) of the policy of the appellant, 
reproduced in para 5 above, they would 
be liable to pay unearned increase 
(“UEI”) in the manner specified in 
Clause 6(a) of the lease deed. The 
obligation to pay UEI does not flow only 
from the instructions issued by the 
competent authority of the appellant 
but primarily from the stipulation in 
the perpetual lease deed in the form of 
Clause 6(a). Viewed thus, the Division 
Bench of the High Court committed a 
manifest error in allowing the appeal 
and setting aside the judgment of the 
learned Single Judge, who had rightly 
dismissed the writ petition and upheld 
the demand notice and the show-cause 
notice calling upon the respondents to 
pay the unearned increase amount in 
terms of Clause 6(a) of the perpetual 
lease deed. That demand was final and 
binding on the respondents, so long as 
the stipulation in the form of Clause 
6(a) of the perpetual lease was in 
force.” 
            
 
(emphasis added) 
This Court was dealing with an order of the Company Judge, 
which provided that the property of a company shall stand 
transferred to the respondent before this Court, and 
therefore, it was a case of transfer to which clause 6(a) of the 
lease deed will be attracted.  Clause 6(a) in the lease subject 
matter of the said case was identical to clause II(4)(a) of the 
perpetual lease in the present case.  This Court also held that 

Civil Appeal no.8336 of 2009  
 
Page 17 of 18 
 
 
clause 2(d) of the policy determining unearned income was 
attracted in the case of transfer due to demerger.  In our view, 
the same principles will apply to a merger, and an unearned 
increase will be payable. In the case of Indian Shaving 
Products Limited1, the High Court of Delhi dealt with the 
amalgamation of companies under the SICA and not under 
the Companies Act. In any event, this court confirmed the 
said decision by summarily dismissing the petition. In the 
present case, the relevant clause II(4)(a) of the leases covers 
involuntary transfers as well.  
10. 
 An argument is also sought to be canvassed that the 
transfer in this case is not covered by the transfer defined 
under Section 5 of the TPA.  Section 5 of the TPA reads thus: 
“5. “Transfer of property” defined.— 
In the following sections “transfer of 
property” means an act by which a 
living person conveys property, in 
present or in future, to one or more 
other living persons, or to himself, and 
one or more other living persons; and 
“to transfer property” is to perform 
such act.  
In this section “living person” includes 
a company or association or body of 
individuals, whether incorporated or 
not, but nothing herein contained shall 
affect any law for the time being in force 
relating to transfer of property to or by 
companies, associations or bodies of 
individuals.” 
11. 
The relevant clause II(4)(a) in the perpetual leases 
subject matter of this appeal is very wide.  It not only covers

transfers but also parting with possession.  Therefore, the 
transfer contemplated by the said clause is much wider than 
what is defined under Section 5.  Importantly, Section 5 
clarifies that nothing contained therein shall affect any law 
for the time being in force in relation to the transfer of 
property to or by companies.  Therefore, Section 5 of the TPA 
will not be of any assistance to the appellant.   
12. 
Therefore, we find nothing illegal about the impugned 
judgment.  Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal with no order 
as to costs. 
13. 
By the order dated 3rd January 2008 of this Court, an 
interim stay was granted to the impugned judgment subject 
to a condition of the appellant depositing a sum of 
Rs.2,13,59,511.20 with this Court.  The office report shows 
that the amount and the interest accrued thereon have been 
separately invested.  Therefore, it will be open for the 
respondent-DDA to withdraw the principal amount of 
Rs.2,13,59,511.20 along with the interest.
