appellant  and  the  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for
the respondents.  
4.
The learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court
decided two proceedings by the impugned judgment.  The
first was a petition under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 for quashing the charge sheet in
CC  No.3  of  2014  pending  on  the  file  of  the  learned
Special  Judge,  CBI  cases,  Chennai.   The  second  was  a
Criminal  Revision  Application   challenging  the  order

dated  4th
 August,  2015  by  which  an  application  for
discharge made by the respondents in the same case was
rejected  by  the  impugned  judgment.   The  learned  Judge
quashed the charge sheet, insofar as the first respondent
is  concerned  and  by  setting  aside  the  order  dated  4th
August, 2015, an order of discharge was passed as regards
another accused.  
5.
One of the contentions raised in these appeals is
that  on  17th
 April,  2017,  the  learned  Single  Judge
pronounced  only  one  line  order  declaring  the  operative
part.  The learned Judge demitted office on 26th May, 2017
and a detailed judgment was made available only on 23rd
October, 2017, nearly 5 months after the learned Judge
demitted  the  office.   On  these  facts,  there  is  no
dispute.
6.
The  operative  part  was  pronounced  on  17th  April,
2017.  There were five weeks available for the learned
Judge to release the reasoned judgment till the date on
which he demitted office. However, the detailed judgment
running into more than 250 pages has come out after a
lapse  of  5  months  from  the  date  on  which  the  learned
Judge demitted the office.  Thus, it is obvious that even
after the learned Judge demitted the office, he assigned
reasons and made the judgment ready.  According to us,
Criminal Appeals @ Diary No.29911/2018
       Page 2 of 4

retaining file of a case for a period of 5 months after
demitting the office is an act of gross impropriety on
the  part of  the learned  Judge.  We cannot  countenance
what has been done in this case.
7.
The  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the
respondents  tried  to  urge  that  we  should  independently
hear the case on merits.  
8.
Lord Hewart said hundred years back that "justice
must not only be done, but must also be seen to be done".
What has been done in this case is contrary to what Lord
Hewart said.  We cannot support such acts of impropriety
and,  therefore, in  our view,  the only  option for  this
Court is to set aside the impugned judgment and remit the
cases to the High Court for a fresh decision.
9.
Accordingly, we set aside the impugned judgment in
Criminal  O.P.No.21243/2014  and  Criminal  Revision  Case
No.1191/2015  in  Criminal  M.P.No.3613/2014  in  CC
No.03/2014 and restore both the matters to the file of
the High Court of Judicature at Madras.  Both the cases
shall be decided by the High Court afresh in accordance
with law.
10.
Needless to add that we have made no adjudication
on the merits of the controversy and all issues are left
open to be decided by the High Court.  If there are any

subsequent events, the parties are free to bring it to
the notice of the High Court in accordance with law.
11.
The appeals are accordingly partly allowed.
