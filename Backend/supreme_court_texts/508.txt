1. 
The dismissal of application under Section 482, 
No.21739 of 2007, essentially, filed under Section 482 of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, ‘the 
Cr.PC’) against dismissal of an application for discharge 
by the appellant herein under Section 227 Cr.PC, as per 
order dated 21.04.2023 by the High Court of Judicature 
at Allahabad is under challenge in this appeal. The 
appellant moved the said application for discharge in 
Crime No.371/1993, the charge in essence there is about 
custodial death of one Ram Kishore who happened to be

cashier/accountant of the appellant, which in fact was 
registered based on the complaint of the appellant.

Heard, learned senior counsel Siddharth Dave 
appearing for the appellant and Shri Ardhendumauli 
Kumar Prasad, Additional Advocate General appearing 
for the State of Uttar Pradesh. 
 
Facts leading to the case: 
3. 
Before narrating the facts, we should bear in mind 
that exercise of power under Section 227, Cr.PC, is 
legally permissible only by considering ‘the record of 
the case and the documents submitted therewith’.  
Therefore, necessarily, the question is what is the 
meaning of the expression ‘the record of the case and 
documents submitted therewith’?  According to us, it 
refers only to the materials produced by the prosecution 
and not by the accused.  A three-Judge Bench of this 
Court considered this question in State of Orissa v. 
Debendra Nath Padhi1.  It was held that the said 
expression as postulated in Section 227, Cr.PC, relate to 
the case and the documents referred to under Section 
209, Cr.PC.  Section 209, Cr.PC, reads thus:- 
 
1 (2005) 1 SCC 568 

 
Page 3 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
“209. Commitment of case to Court of Session 
when offence is triable exclusively by it. — 
When in a case instituted on a police report or 
otherwise, the accused appears or is brought 
before the Magistrate and it appears to the 
Magistrate that the offence is triable exclusively 
by the Court of Session, he shall — 
(a) 
commit, 
after 
complying 
with 
the 
provisions of section 207 or section 208, as the 
case may be, the case to the Court of Session, 
and subject to the provisions of this Code 
relating to bail, remand the accused to 
custody until such commitment has been 
made; 
(b) subject to the provisions of this Code 
relating to bail, remand the accused to 
custody during, and until the conclusion of, 
the trial; 
(c) send to that Court the record of the case 
and the documents and articles, if any, which 
are to be produced in evidence; 
(d) notify the Public Prosecutor of the 
commitment of the case to the Court of 
Session.” 
 
 
In view of Section 209, Cr.PC, as extracted above, 
to know what exactly are the documents falling within the 

 
Page 4 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
said expression Sections 207 and 208, Cr.PC, are also to 
be looked into. 
4. 
We referred to the provisions under Section 227 
and the decision in Debendra Nath Padhi’s case (supra) 
only to conclude that even for the purpose of referring to 
the facts leading to the case, as also for consideration of 
the contentions for the purpose of Section 227, Cr.PC, we 
cannot refer to the grounds carrying or referring to the 
case of the appellant-accused, in view of the aforesaid 
provisions of law and position of law, requiring to confine 
such consideration only with reference to the materials 
produced by the prosecution. 
5. 
Now, we will refer to the facts leading to the case, 
as per the prosecution and as per the materials falling 
within the purview of Section 227, Cr.PC. 
6. 
The appellant, who is the owner of Goodwill 
Enterprises dealing with wood, registered Case Crime 
No.351 of 1993 under Section 392 of the Indian Penal 
Code, 1860 (for short ‘the IPC’) at Police Station Modi 
Nagar, 
District 
Ghaziabad, 
alleging 
that 
his 
cashier/accountant-Ram Kishore and one Pappu Yadav 
went for collecting his business proceeds from shops at 
Meerut and Modi Nagar in the morning of 15.07.1993. On 
their way back from Meerut, after collecting such 

 
Page 5 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
business proceeds, they stopped the car in front of Ginni 
Devi School in Modi Nagar and Ram Kishore went to 
Poonam Sales for collection and Pappu Yadav remain 
seated in the car with the bag containing the collection 
and some documents.  Soon, two persons came and 
snatched the said bag from Pappu Yadav after putting 
him at gun point and escaped on a motorcycle. The 
appellant was given such information over phone.  Later, 
on that day itself the appellant got registered the above-
mentioned 
FIR 
about 
robbery 
and 
asked 
for 
investigation and appropriate legal action, in the 
incident. 
 
7. 
The materials on record and the counter affidavit 
filed in this appeal on behalf of the respondent based on 
such materials would reveal that the initial investigation 
in Case Crime No.351/1993 (hereinafter referred to as 
‘the robbery case’) found it to be false.  However, the 
Supervising Officer concerned viz., the Commanding 
Officer, Modi Nagar stopped the closure report and 
entrusted the case for investigation to another officer. 
Thereafter, on 17.07.1993, the appellant called Ram 
Kishore from his house through one of his employees 
viz., Jagannath and took him to the Modi Nagar Police 

 
Page 6 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
Station for inquiry.  It is only appropriate to extract from 
the chargesheet dated 21.02.2000 filed by CBCID, 
Lucknow, U.P., in FIR No. 371/1993 of Police Station, 
Modi Nagar, registered in connection with the custodial 
death of Ram Kishore unfolding further the case of the 
prosecution instead of narrating it.  It in so far as relevant 
reads thus:- 
“…Ram Kishore was illegally kept in the police 
station by Inspector of Police R.D. Pathak and 
Sub-Inspector of Police Jawahar Lal from 
17.07.1993 
to 
23.07.1993 
night 
and 
by 
subjecting him to the torture he was kept being 
interrogated about the said incident. In the night 
of date 23.07.1993 on Ram Kishore felling ill he 
was taken to M.M.G. Hospital Ghaziabad by 
Inspector R.D. Pathak through staffs and Jeep 
where on 3:20 in the morning he died. He was 
admitted by the police in the Hospital in the 
name of unknown. After death of the young man 
Ram Kishore on date 24.07.1993, a complaint 
regarding 
death 
was 
submitted 
by 
the 
complainant to the Circle Inspector Modi Nagar 
raising suspicion about death of Shri Ram 
Kishore having been caused by the Inspector of 
Modi Nagar by beating him on which Crime 

 
Page 7 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
Case No.371/1993 was registered illegible. As 
per the post mortem report dated 24.07.1993 
ante mortem redics cut incision were found on 
his both the buttocks and because of the cause 
of death not having been ascertained his internal 
organs were preserved which was examined on 
date 03.01.1995 poison etc. were ruled out. …” 
 
8. 
In the chargesheet dated 21.02.2000 filed in Crime 
No.371/1993, the aforesaid Rameshwar Dayal Pathak, 
the then Inspector of Police and Jawahar Lal, the then 
Sub-Inspector of Police and the appellant were made 
accused Nos. 1 to 3 respectively, for commission of 
offences under Sections 302, 343, 217, 218, 330, 120B 
and 34, IPC.  It is seeking discharge under Section 227, 
Cr.PC, in the aforesaid case viz., Crime No.371/1993 
that appellant herein approached the court of 
Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge, Ghaziabad 
by filing application dated 04.04.2007 contending 
absolute absence any ground to proceed against him.  
The said application for discharge under Section 227, 
Cr.PC, was rejected by the court of Additional Sessions 
Judge/Special Judge (CBI), as per order dated 
19.04.2007.  The impugned order dated 21.04.2023 was 

 
Page 8 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
passed by the High Court in the petition filed under 
Section 482, Cr.PC, against the said order dated 
19.04.2007. 
 
Rival contentions: 
 
9. 
The learned senior counsel appearing for the 
appellant would contend that the very charge filed by 
the CBCID dated 21.02.2000 in the custodial death case 
viz., FIR No. 371/2023 would reveal that the appellant 
herein is the informant.   It is also submitted that the final 
report filed in the ‘custodial death case’, dated 
21.02.2000 would further show that he was witness No.1 
and also as accused No.3.  The Learned Senior Counsel 
would further submit that there is absolute absence of 
any material to arraign the appellant herein as an 
accused with the aid of either Section 120B, IPC or 
Section 34, IPC.  The next submission was that even if 
the statements of the witnesses recorded under Section 
161, Cr.PC, including the witnesses related to the 
deceased Ram Kishore like Smt. Santosh, Shri Promod 
Kumar and Shri Bhim Singh, who are respectively the 
widow, son and brother of deceased Ram Kishore are 
taken as correct, they would not reveal anything to base 
an allegation of criminal conspiracy or sharing of 

 
Page 9 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
common intention against the appellant.  It is the further 
submission that virtually, the appellant’s application for 
discharge was dismissed by the Court of the Additional 
Sessions Judge taking two circumstances as suspicious 
circumstances (i) that it was he who had taken accused 
Ram Kishore to Police Station in connection with the 
investigation in Crime No.351/1993 (the robbery case) 
(ii) that immediately on the death of Ram Kishore from 
the hospital he filed the complaint which culminated in 
the registration of FIR No.371/1993 in connection with 
the murder of Ram Kishore, alleging that Inspector, 
Modi Nagar and 3-4 other police personnel had taken 
Ram 
Kishore 
with 
them 
for 
interrogation 
and 
apprehending the cause of his death due to torture by 
police personnel.  It is submitted neither the statements 
of witnesses or the chargesheet carry any such 
accusation or insinuation and that suspicion was made 
only by the court in the order dated 19.04.2007 while 
rejecting the appellant’s application for discharge.  In 
short, the contention is that neither the trial court nor the 
High Court considered the application for discharge in 
the manner required under law.   
10. Per Contra, the learned Additional Advocate 
General appearing for the State would submit the 

 
Page 10 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
materials on record produced along with the 
chargesheet would prima facie show that it was the 
appellant who lodged the complaint resulting in 
registration of Crime No.351/1993, and that it was in 
connection with the investigation of the said crime that 
the appellant himself produced the deceased Ram 
Kishore before the Police Station after calling him from 
his house through another employee and as such his 
very action in filing another complaint leading to the 
registration of Crime No.371/1993 against the first 
accused, the then SHO, Police Station, Modi Nagar, for 
the death of Ram Kishore immediately on coming to 
know about the death of Ram Kishore, is sufficient to 
create a strong suspicion against the appellant. When 
such a strong suspicion is there, in the light of the 
statements made by the other witnesses under Section 
161, Cr.PC, the concurrent finding resulted in dismissal 
of application for discharge filed by the appellant 
invites no interference, according to the learned 
Additional Advocate General.  
11. For appreciating the aforesaid contentions, we are 
of the considered view that it is only appropriate to 
refer to the position of law with respect to the scope of 
exercise of power under Section 227, Cr.PC, as also the 

 
Page 11 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
ingredients to attract Section 120B, IPC.  Section 227, 
Cr.PC, reads thus: 
 
“227. Discharge.—If, upon consideration of the 
record of the case and the documents submitted 
therewith, and after hearing the submissions of the 
accused and the prosecution in this behalf, the 
Judge considers that there is not sufficient ground 
for proceeding against the accused, he shall 
discharge the accused and record his reasons for 
so doing.” 
  
12. We have already considered the meaning of the 
expression “the record of the case and the documents 
submitted therewith” relying on the decision in 
Debendra Nath Padhi’s case (supra) only to re-assure 
as to what are the materials falling under the said 
expression and thus, available for consideration of an 
application filed for discharge under Section 227, 
Cr.PC.   In the light of the same, there cannot be any 
doubt with respect to the position that at the stage of 
consideration of such an application for discharge, 
defence case or material, if produced at all by the 
accused, cannot be looked at all.  Once “the record of 
the case and the documents submitted therewith” are 

 
Page 12 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
before the Court they alone can be looked into for 
considering 
the 
application 
for 
discharge 
and 
thereafter if it considers that there is no sufficient 
ground for proceeding against the accused concerned 
then he shall be discharged after recording reasons 
therefor.   In that regard, it is only appropriate to 
consider the authorities dealing with the question as to 
what exactly is the scope of consideration and what 
should be the manner of consideration while exercising 
such power.         
13. The decision in Yogesh alias Sachin Jagadish 
Joshi v. State of Maharashtra2 this Court held that the 
words “not sufficient ground for proceeding against the 
accused” appearing in Section 227, Cr.PC, postulate 
exercise of judicial mind on the part of the Judge to the 
facts of the case revealed from the materials brought on 
record by the prosecution in order to determine 
whether a case for trial has been made out.   In the 
decision in State of Tamil Nadu v. N Suresh Rajan & 
Ors.3 this Court held that at a stage of consideration of 
an application for discharge, the Court has to proceed 
with an assumption that the materials brought on record 
 
2 AIR 2008 SC 2991 
3 (2014) 11 SCC 709 

 
Page 13 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
by the prosecution are true, and evaluate the materials 
to find out whether the facts taken at their face value 
disclose the existence of the ingredients constituting 
the offence.  At this stage, only the probative value of 
the materials has to be gone into and the court is not 
expected to go deep into the matter to hold a mini-trial.   
14. In the decision in BK Sharma v. State of UP4, the 
High Court of judicature at Allahabad held that the 
standard of test and judgment which is finally applied 
before recording a finding of conviction against an 
accused is not to be applied at the stage of framing the 
charge.  It is just a very strong suspicion, based on the 
material on record, and would be sufficient to frame a 
charge.  
15. We are in agreement with the said view taken by 
the High Court.  At the same time, we would add that the 
strong suspicion in order to be sufficient to frame a 
charge should be based on the material brought on 
record by the prosecution and should not be based on 
supposition, suspicions and conjectures.   In other 
words, in order to be a basis to frame charge the strong 
 
4 1987 SCC OnLine ALL 314 

 
Page 14 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
suspicion should be the one emerging from the 
materials on record brought by the prosecution.     
16. In the decision in Stree Atyachar Virodhi Parishad 
v. Dilip Nathumal Chordia & Anr.5, this Court held that 
the word ‘ground’ in Section 227, Cr.PC, did not mean 
a ground for conviction, but a ground for putting the 
accused on trial.    
17. In P. Vijayan v. State of Kerala and Anr.6, after 
extracting Section 227, Cr.PC, this Court in paragraph 
No.10 and 11 held thus: - 
 
“10.  
**** 
 
****  
****  
**** 
…….If two views are possible and one of them gives 
rise to suspicion only, as distinguished from grave 
suspicion, the trial Judge will be empowered to 
discharge the accused and at this stage he is not to 
see whether the trial will end in conviction or 
acquittal. Further, the words “not sufficient ground 
for proceeding against the accused” clearly show 
that the Judge is not a mere post office to frame the 
charge at the behest of the prosecution, but has to 
exercise his judicial mind to the facts of the case in 
order to determine whether a case for trial has been 
 
5 (1989) 1 SCC 715 
6 (2010) 2 SCC 398 

 
Page 15 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
made out by the prosecution. In assessing this fact, it 
is not necessary for the court to enter into the pros 
and cons of the matter or into a weighing and 
balancing of evidence and probabilities which is 
really the function of the court, after the trial starts. 
 
11. At the stage of Section 227, the Judge has merely 
to sift the evidence in order to find out whether or not 
there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the 
accused. In other words, the sufficiency of ground 
would take within its fold the nature of the evidence 
recorded by the police or the documents produced 
before the court which ex facie disclose that there are 
suspicious circumstances against the accused so as to 
frame a charge against him.” 
 
 
18. In paragraph 13 in P. Vijayan’s case (supra), this 
Court took note of the principles enunciated earlier by 
this Court in Union of India v. Prafulla Kumar Samal7 
which reads thus: - 
“10…. 
(1) That the Judge while considering the question of 
framing the charges under Section 227 of the Code 
has the undoubted power to sift and weigh the 
 
7 (1979) 3 SCC 4 

 
Page 16 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
evidence for the limited purpose of finding out 
whether or not a prima facie case against the accused 
has been made out. 
(2) Where the materials placed before the Court 
disclose grave suspicion against the accused which 
has not been properly explained the Court will be 
fully justified in framing a charge and proceeding 
with the trial. 
(3) The test to determine a prima facie case would 
naturally depend upon the facts of each case and it is 
difficult to lay down a rule of universal application. By 
and large however if two views are equally possible 
and the Judge is satisfied that the evidence produced 
before him while giving rise to some suspicion but not 
grave suspicion against the accused, he will be fully 
within his right to discharge the accused. 
(4) That in exercising his jurisdiction under Section 
227 of the Code the Judge which under the present 
Code is a senior and experienced court cannot act 
merely as a post office or a mouthpiece of the 
prosecution, but has to consider the broad 
probabilities of the case, the total effect of the 
evidence and the documents produced before the 
Court, any basic infirmities appearing in the case and 
so on. This however does not mean that the Judge 

 
Page 17 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
should make a roving enquiry into the pros and cons 
of the matter and weigh the evidence as if he was 
conducting a trial.” 
 
19. In the light of the decisions referred supra, it is thus 
obvious that it will be within the jurisdiction of the Court 
concerned to sift and weigh the evidence for the limited 
purpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie case 
against the accused concerned has been made out.   We 
are of the considered view that a caution has to be 
sounded for the reason that the chances of going 
beyond the permissible jurisdiction under Section 227, 
Cr.PC, and entering into the scope of power under 
Section 232, Cr.PC, cannot be ruled out as such 
instances are aplenty.  In this context, it is relevant to 
refer to a decision of this Court in Om Parkash Sharma 
v. CBI8.   Taking note of the language of Section 227, 
Cr.PC, is in negative terminology and that the language 
in Section 232, Cr.PC, is in the positive terminology and 
considering this distinction between the two, this Court 
held that it would not be open to the Court while 
considering an application under Section 227, Cr.PC, to 
weigh the pros and cons of the evidence alleged 
 
8 (2000) 5 SCC 679 

 
Page 18 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
improbability and then proceed to discharge the 
accused holding that the statements existing in the case 
therein are unreliable.  It is held that doing so would be 
practically acting under Section 232, Cr.PC, even 
though the said stage has not reached. In short, though 
it is permissible to sift and weigh the materials for the 
limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima 
facie case is made out against the accused, on 
appreciation of the admissibility and the evidentiary 
value such materials brought on record by the 
prosecution is impermissible as it would amount to 
denial of opportunity to the prosecution to prove them 
appropriately at the appropriate stage besides 
amounting to exercise of the power coupled with 
obligation under Section 232, Cr.PC, available only 
after taking the evidence for the prosecution and 
examining the accused.     
20. Even after referring to the aforesaid decisions, we 
think it absolutely appropriate to refer to a decision of 
the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Kaushalya Devi v. 
State of MP9.   It was held in the said case that if there is 
no legal evidence, then framing of charge would be 
 
9 2003 SCC OnLine MP 672 

 
Page 19 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
groundless and compelling the accused to face the trial 
is contrary to the procedure offending Article 21 of the 
Constitution of India.  While agreeing with the view, we 
make it clear that the expression ‘legal evidence’ has to 
be construed only as evidence disclosing prima facie 
case, ‘the record of the case and the documents 
submitted therewith’.  
21. The stage of Section 227, Cr.PC, is equally crucial 
and determinative to both the prosecution and the 
accused, we will dilate the issue further.   In this context, 
certain other aspects also require consideration.  It 
cannot be said that Section 227, Cr.PC, is couched in 
negative terminology without a purpose.    Charge 
sheet is a misnomer for the final report filed under 
Section 173 (2), Cr.PC, which is not a negative report 
and one that carries an accusation against the accused 
concerned of having committed the offence (s) 
mentioned therein.  
22. In cases, where it appears that the said offence(s) 
is one triable exclusively by the Court of Session, the 
Magistrate shall have to commit the case to the Court of 
Session 
concerned 
following 
the 
prescribed 
procedures under Cr.PC.  In such cases, though it 
carries an accusation as aforementioned still legislature 

 
Page 20 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
thought it appropriate to provide an inviolable right as 
a precious safeguard for the accused, a pre-battle 
protection under Section 227, Cr.PC.  Though, this 
provision is couched in negative it obligated the court 
concerned to unfailingly consider the record of the case 
and document submitted therewith and also to hear the 
submissions of the accused and the prosecution in that 
behalf to arrive at a conclusion as to whether or not 
sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused is 
available thereunder.   Certainly, if the answer of such 
consideration is in the negative, the court is bound to 
discharge the accused and to record reasons therefor.   
The corollary is that the question of framing the charge 
would arise only in a case where the court upon such 
exercise satisfies itself about the prima facie case 
revealing from “the record of the case and the 
documents submitted therewith” against the accused 
concerned.  In short, it can be said in that view of the 
matter that the intention embedded is to ensure that an 
accused will be made to stand the ordeal of trial only if 
‘the record of the case and the documents submitted 
therewith’ discloses ground for proceeding against him. 
When that be so, in a case where an application is filed 
for discharge under Section 227, Cr.PC, it is an 

 
Page 21 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
irrecusable duty and obligation of the Court to apply its 
mind and answer to it regarding the existence of or 
otherwise, of ground for proceeding against the 
accused, by confining such consideration based only 
on the record of the case and the documents submitted 
therewith and after hearing the submissions of the 
accused and the prosecution in that behalf.  To wit, such 
conclusion on existence or otherwise of ground to 
proceed against the accused concerned should not be 
and could not be based on mere suppositions or 
suspicions or conjectures, especially not founded upon 
material available before the Court.  We are not 
oblivious of the fact that normally, the Court is to record 
his reasons only for discharging an accused at the stage 
of Section 227, Cr.PC.  However, when an application 
for discharge is filed under Section 227, Cr.PC, the 
Court concerned is bound to disclose the reason(s), 
though, not in detail, for finding sufficient ground for 
rejecting the application or in other words, for finding 
prima facie case, as it will enable the superior Court to 
examine the challenge against the order of rejection.  
23. By applying the laws enunciated and the principles 
laid, we will proceed to consider the case on hand.  In 
the final report filed in FIR No.371 of 1993 viz., in the 

 
Page 22 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
custodial death case, the afore-extracted portion from it 
revealed that the essence of the accusation is 
commission of custodial death owing to the torture to 
which Ram Kishore was subjected to, from 17.07.1993 to 
23.07.1993.  It reveals that going by the same, he was 
illegally kept in the Police Station by accused Nos.1 and 
2.  A scanning of the charge as also the other materials 
including the statements of the witnesses recorded 
under Section 161, Cr.PC, would reveal that there is 
absolute absence of any accusation or even an 
insinuation that the appellant had played any role in 
torturing Ram Kishore.  Therefore, the question is how 
he is arraigned as third accused in the aforesaid crime.  
In that regard, it is apposite to refer again to the final 
report dated 21.02.2000 filed in Crime No.371/1993.   
The relevant portion in the final report in this regard, 
reads thus: - 
“…In this manner from this investigation, it was found 
that deceased Ram Kishore was kept in the Police 
Station from dated 17.07.1993 to 23.07.1993 in the 
Police Station under the criminal Conspiracy of the 
accused persons mentioned in the column no.3 
during which he was tortured and interrogated 
regarding the incident of loot and knowingly with the

intention of saving their skins no entry of the same was 
made in the records of the Police Station nor was the 
same mentioned by the complainant in its report. 
Charge under Section 341/217/218/201/330/34 
/120B Indian Penal Code, 1860 was found to have 
been made out against all the accused persons. …” 
 
24. From the above extracted portion, it is evident that 
the implication of the appellant in the crime is with the 
aid of Section 120B and Section 34, IPC.  Apart from 
using the expression “criminal conspiracy” there is 
absolute absence of anything whatsoever in the said 
final report as also in the statement of any of the 
witnesses, suggesting that the appellant herein 
conspired with the other accused or what exactly is the 
criminal conspiracy.    
25. This Court in the decision in R. Venkatakrishnan v. 
CBI10, held that criminal conspiracy, in terms of Section 
120B, IPC, is an independent offence and its ingredients 
are: 
(i) an agreement between two or more persons; 
(ii) the agreement must relate to doing or causing 
to be done either –  
 
10 (2009) 11 SCC 737 

 
Page 24 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
(a) an illegal act; 
(b) an act which is not illegal in itself but is 
also done by illegal means.  
26. An important facet of law of conspiracy is that apart 
from it being a distinct offence, all conspirators are 
liable for the acts of each other of the crime or crimes 
which have been committed as a result of conspiracy.  
A careful scanning of the provisions under Sections 
120A and 120B, IPC, would reveal that the sine qua non 
for an offence of criminal conspiracy is an agreement to 
commit an offence.  It consists of agreement between 
two or more persons to commit the criminal offence, 
irrespective of the further consideration whether or not 
the offence is actually committed as the very fact of 
conspiracy constitutes the offence (See the decision in 
K.S. Narayanan & Ors. v. G Gopinathan11). 
27. There can be no doubt that conspiracy is hatched 
in privacy and not in secrecy, and such it would rarely 
be possible to establish conspiracy by direct evidence.  
A few bits here and a few bits there, on which the 
prosecution may rely, are not sufficient to connect an 
accused with the commission of the crime of criminal 
 
11 1982 CriLJ 1611 (Madras) 

 
Page 25 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
conspiracy.  To constitute even an accusation of 
criminal conspiracy, first and foremost, there must at 
least be an accusation of meeting of minds of two or 
more persons for doing an illegal act or an act, which is 
not illegal in itself, by illegal means.    
28. In Ajay Aggarwal v. Union of India & Ors.12, this 
Court characterized the offence of criminal conspiracy 
as an agreement between two or more persons to do an 
illegal act or 
a legal through illegal means.  
Furthermore, it was held that commission of the offence 
would be complete as soon as, there is consensus ad 
idem and it would be immaterial whether or not the 
offence is actually committed.  It is also held therein that 
necessarily there must be agreement between the 
conspirators on the design or object of the conspiracy.    
As held in R. Venkatakrishnan case (supra), the 
quintessential ingredient to attract the offence of 
criminal conspiracy is agreement between two or more 
persons. Therefore, the question is whether it spelt in 
the final report dated 21.02.2000 or in any of the records 
of the case and documents submitted therewith, so as to 
find a prima facie case of commission of criminal 
 
12 (1993) 3 SCC 609 

 
Page 26 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
conspiracy against the appellant.  True that an 
agreement referred to in Section 120A, IPC may be 
expressed or implied or in part express and in part 
implied.  However, no record of the case or documents 
submitted 
therewith 
carry 
such 
an 
allegation/accusation against the appellant.   
29. What is the common plan or the common intention?   
This aspect is also conspicuously absent in the materials 
produced by the prosecution.  In regard to all such 
aspects, referred above, none of the witnesses has 
spoken while giving statements under Section 161, 
Cr.PC.  In this context it is also to be noted that 
according to the Trial Court, a very strong suspicion 
lingers on account of twin circumstances.  In the order 
dated 19.04.2007, the Trial Court in this regard 
observed and held thus: - 
“ The learned Assistant District Government 
Counsel (Criminal) has argued that if the 
accused persons says that he had fell ill in the 
night and he was complaining of having pain in 
the chest then why his family members were not 
informed. The said condition is also very much 
suspicious. Besides these, the accused was 
handed over to the police by the accused Ram 

 
Page 27 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
Prakash Chaddha himself and in the next day 
morning the report was lodged by him only. 
 
Keeping in view the abovementioned 
entire 
facts 
and 
circumstances 
sufficient 
evidences are available on the record for the 
framing of charge against the accused persons 
Rameshwar Dayal Pathak and Jawahar Lal and 
Ram Prakash Chaddha.”   
 
30. In the light of the records of the case and the 
documents submitted therewith, it can only be found 
that the said finding of the Trial Court on the ground to 
proceed against the appellant is based on suppositions 
and suspicions, having no foundational support from 
the materials produced by the prosecution.   With 
respect to the first part of the above-extracted recital 
from the order of the Trial Court, it is to be noted that it 
is nobody’s case that the appellant was in the Police 
Station or informed of the sufferance from chest pain.  
As relates the second suspicion, it is to be noted that the 
very Trial Court itself, in the very order dated 
19.04.2007 itself, stated that in Crime No.351/1993 
under Section 392, IPC the deceased Ram Kishore was 
only a witness and that the amount in cash and the draft 
involved was that of the appellant.   It is also the case of 

 
Page 28 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
the prosecution that the said case was registered, at the 
instance of the appellant against unknown persons.    
Hence, when the appellant who lost the money went to 
Police Station along with the witness thereof, how can it 
be presumed by the Court as a strong case for suspicion 
for commission of the offence of criminal conspiracy, 
especially taking note of the very case of the 
prosecution that causative incident for the case 
occurred when Ram Kishore was returning after 
collecting the business proceeds of the appellant and 
that the appellant was informed of it over telephone by 
Ram Kishore.   When there is no case for the prosecution 
that the appellant pointed the fingers at Ram Kishore 
how the lodging of the complaint, apprehending 
custodial death of Ram Kishore who was appellant’s 
clerk for about 13 years, which caused the registration 
of custodial death case under FIR No.371/1993 can be 
taken as a ground for framing charge against the 
appellant for the offences punishable under Section 
302, IPC, 120-B with the aid of Section 34, IPC.  
31. These aspects were not at all considered by the 
High Court.  To say the least, there was no consideration 
of the matter by the High Court in the manner required 

 
Page 29 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
under law, in the given facts and circumstances of the 
case.    
32.   We are at a loss to understand, how in the absence 
of ground for a prima facie case revealed from the 
materials produced by the prosecution a person who 
lost his money and lodged a complaint based on the 
information furnished by his employee can be 
implicated in an offence, that too a grave allegation of 
commission of an offence of custodial death amounting 
to murder, merely because he caused the presence of 
the person concerned before the Police Station unless 
the ingredients to attract criminal conspiracy to commit 
any specific offence in relation to Ram Kishore is 
available. If the case of the prosecution and the 
materials produced along with the charge are taken as 
true, they would only suggest that Ram Kishore was 
under the control of the police in the Police Station.  In 
fact, that exactly is the prosecution case revealed from 
the final report dated 21.02.2000 filed in Crime 
No.371/1993.    
33. The aforesaid being the position revealed from the 
materials produced by the prosecution, the mere fact 
that rejection of the application of the appellant for 
discharge is concurrent cannot be a reason for 

 
Page 30 of 31 
Criminal Appeal No. 2395 of 2023 
confirming the impugned order of the High Court 
confirming the order of the Trial Court.  Since the 
diallage on the matter constrain us to come to the 
concrete conclusion of absence of ground for 
proceeding against the appellant based on final report 
dated 21.02.2000 in Crime No.371/1993 of CBCID, U.P. 
Lucknow, this appeal must succeed.   
34. We clarify that the observations made in this 
judgment are made qua the appellant for the purpose 
of disposal of this appeal and we make it clear that we 
have not made any observation touching the merits of 
the case against the other accused in Crime 
No.371/1993 of CBCID, U.P. Lucknow. 
35. For the reasons given as above, this appeal is 
allowed.  Consequently, the order and judgment dated 
21.04.2023 passed by the High Court of Judicature at 
Allahabad in application No.21739 of 2007 filed under 
Section 482, Cr.PC, and the order dated 19.04.2007 
passed by the Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge 
(CBI) are set aside.  As a necessary sequel, the 
application filed by the appellant under Section 227, 
Cr.PC, dated 04.04.2007 for discharge in Crime 
No.351/1993 filed in Sessions Trial No.1532/2005 
before Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge (CBI),
