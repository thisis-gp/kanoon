The instant appeal assails the correctness of an order dated 
26.07.2019 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana (the 
“High Court”) in FAO-146-M-2005 (O&M) (the “Impugned 
Order”). Pertinently, vide the Impugned Order, the High Court 
dismissed the appeal; and accordingly upheld the correctness of 
an order dated 09.12.2004 passed by the Ld. Additional District 
Judge (Ad. Hoc), Faridabad (the “Family Court”) whereunder 
the Family Court dismissed a petition instituted by the Appellant 
herein under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 
seeking dissolution of marriage by way of a decree of divorce 
(the “Underlying Order”).

3. 
The Appellant and the Respondent before this Court were 
married on 14.10.1991 as per Hindu rites and rituals, at 
Faridabad, Haryana. Out of the wedlock two children were born 
on 25.08.1993 and 02.05.1996. 
4. 
Despite being together for approximately 14 (fourteen) 
years, bitterness crept into the relationship between the parties. 
Whilst on one hand, it is alleged that the Respondent ill-treated 
the Appellant; and constantly acted against the Appellant at the 
behest of her parents. On the other hand, the Respondent Wife 
alleged cruelty and torture at the hands of the Appellant Husband.  
5. 
Despite our best effort(s), the parties were adamant on 
parting ways - citing an irretrievable breakdown of their 
marriage. Accordingly, it was submitted that the marriage 
between the parties be dissolved on the aforesaid ground. 
Reliance in this regard was placed on a decision of this Court in 
Shilpa Sailesh v. Varun Sreenivasan, 2023 SCC Online SC 544 
wherein it was observed that a marriage may be dissolved on the 
ground of an irretrievable breakdown in exercise of the 
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 142(1) of the Constitution 
of India. This Court in Shilpa Sailesh (Supra) delineated various 
factor(s) to be considered by this Court whilst exercising such 
jurisdiction. The relevant paragraph is reproduced below: 
“41. Having said so, we wish to clearly state that 
grant of divorce on the ground of irretrievable

breakdown of marriage by this Court is not a 
matter of right, but a discretion which is to be 
exercised with great care and caution, keeping in 
mind several factors ensuring that ‘complete 
justice’ is done to both parties. It is obvious that 
this Court should be fully convinced and satisfied 
that the marriage is totally unworkable, 
emotionally dead and beyond salvation and, 
therefore, dissolution of marriage is the right 
solution and the only way forward. That the 
marriage has irretrievably broken down is to be 
factually determined and firmly established. For 
this, several factors are to be considered such as 
the period of time the parties had cohabited after 
marriage; when the parties had last cohabited; the 
nature of allegations made by the parties against 
each other and their family members; the orders 
passed in the legal proceedings from time to time, 
cumulative impact on the personal relationship; 
whether, and how many attempts were made to 
settle the disputes by intervention of the court or 
through mediation, and when the last attempt was 
made, etc. The period of separation should be 
sufficiently long, and anything above six years or 
more will be a relevant factor. But these facts have 
to be evaluated keeping in view the economic and 
social status of the parties, including their 
educational qualifications, whether the parties 
have any children, their age, educational 
qualification, and whether the other spouse and 
children are dependent, in which event how and in 
what manner the party seeking divorce intends to 
take care and provide for the spouse or the 
children. Question of custody and welfare of 
minor children, provision for fair and adequate 
alimony for the wife, and economic rights of the 
children and other pending matters, if any, are 

SLP (C) No. 3747 of 2020

relevant considerations. We would not like to 
codify the factors so as to curtail exercise of 
jurisdiction 
under 
Article 
142(1) 
of 
the 
Constitution of India, which is situation specific. 
Some of the factors mentioned can be taken as 
illustrative, and worthy of consideration.” 
6. 
Having prima-facie satisfied ourselves that the present 
dispute met the aforenoted parameters, we requested Shri P.S. 
Patwalia, Learned Senior Counsel, to assist this Court in putting 
a quietus to the present lis. On 22.03.2024, we were informed by 
Mr. Patwalia that despite his best efforts, the parties were not 
willing to arrive at an amicable settlement and that there was no 
possibility of the parties residing together. At our request, Mr. 
Patwalia placed on a record a short note outlining the details of 
his efforts including inter alia the deliberations between the 
parties in respect of the quantum of permanent alimony to be paid 
by the Appellant towards the Respondent. 
7. 
We have given due consideration to submissions made by 
the respective counsels and the materials placed on record. The 
undisputed facts of the case reveal that the parties have separated 
22 (twenty-two) years ago i.e., having cohabited last in January 
2002. The children are now majors and gainfully employed; elder 
son is an associate in a dental clinic; and younger son is a 
video/film editor. Thus, keeping in view the totality of 
circumstances, we are satisfied that the facts on record establish 
that the marriage between the parties has broken down and that 

SLP (C) No. 3747 of 2020  
 
Page 5 of 6 
 
there is no possibility that the parties would cohabit together in 
the future. Accordingly, we are of the considered opinion that the 
formal union between the parties is neither justified nor desirable.  
8. 
Thus, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the 
allegations levelled inter se the parties, we deem it appropriate to 
exercise our discretion under Article 142(1) of the Constitution 
of India and pass a decree of divorce on the ground of 
irretrievable breakdown of marriage. 
9. 
However, considering the fact that the Appellant has 
previously been employed by various multinational corporations 
in managerial post(s); and the fact that the Appellant is presently 
endowed with a respectable estate; we deem it fit and proper that 
the Appellant pays an amount of Rs. 50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty 
Lakh Only) to the Respondent Wife as permanent alimony. The 
aforesaid amount shall be paid to the Respondent Wife as per the 
following schedule:  
Date  
Amount 
May 15, 2024 
Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakh Only) 
June 15, 2024 
Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakh Only) 
July 15, 2024 
Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakh Only) 
August 15, 2024 
Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakh Only) 
September 15, 2024 Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakh Only) 
10. 
The appeal stands allowed in the aforesaid terms. The 
Registry is directed to prepare a decree of divorce accordingly.

The decree shall be handed over to the parties, only after proof of 
payment of the full amount as indicated by us above is furnished 
to the Registry.  
11.  
Before parting, we place on record our gratitude to            
Shri P.S. Patwalia,  Learned Senior Counsel for the assistance 
rendered to this Court.  
12. 
 Pending application(s) (if any), shall stand disposed of.
