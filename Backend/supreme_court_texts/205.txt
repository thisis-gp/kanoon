for quashing of C.C. Nos. 3151 & 3150 of 2017, on the file of 
learned XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai (now 
transferred to the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Fast Track 
Court-III, Saidapet, Chennai), in connection with the offence 
punishable under Section 138 read with Section 142 of the 
Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as “the 
N.I. Act”).  
3. 
The facts, in brief, giving rise to the present appeals are as 
follows: 
3.1 M/s. Bharti Airtel Limited (hereinafter referred to as, 
“complainant” or “respondent”), is a company engaged in the 
business of providing telecommunication services, under a 
license issued by the Government of India, in various telecom 
circles in India.  
3.2 One M/s. Fibtel Telecom Solutions (India) Private Limited 
(hereinafter referred to as, “Fibtel Telecom Solutions” or 
“Company”), a company registered with the Telecom Regulatory 
Authority of India (TRAI) as a telemarketer, had approached the 

3 
 
respondent intending to obtain telecom resources for the purpose 
of transactional communication and requested the complainant 
for allotment of telecom resources for the said purpose. One 
Manju Sukumaran Lalitha is the Director & Authorized Signatory 
of Fibtel Telecom Solutions and one Susela Padmavathy Amma, 
the appellant herein, is the Director of Fibtel Telecom Solutions.  
3.3 Based on the representation made by Fibtel Telecom 
Solutions, the respondent had agreed to provide the required 
services, whereupon the parties entered into a Service 
Agreement, vide which Fibtel Telecom Solutions had to pay Rs. 
14,00,000/- as fixed monthly recurring charges to the 
respondent. It is the thus the case of the respondent that Fibtel 
Telecom Solutions owes a sum of Rs. 2,55,08,309/-, in lieu of the 
service provided to it by the respondent.  
3.4 However, the grievance of the respondent is that in-spite of 
regular follow-ups and reminders, Fibtel Telecom Solutions failed 
and neglected to clear the respondent’s dues. Only thereafter, 
upon repeated demands made by the respondent, Fibtel Telecom 

4 
 
Solutions furnished five post-dated cheques to the complainant, 
on 17th June 2016, details of which are as given below:

3.5 On deposit of the cheque mentioned at Sr. No. 1 in the table, 
bearing cheque no. 414199 and dated 25th June 2016, by the 
respondent, the said cheque was returned to it unpaid with 
reason “payment stopped by drawer”. Aggrieved thereby, the 
respondent issued a legal notice to Fibtel Telecom Solutions, on 
receipt of which & following an oral agreement between them, a 
payment schedule was agreed to and a cheque for an amount of 
Rs. 25,00,000/- drawn by Fibtel Telecom Solutions was 
honoured by it. However, when the complainant deposited the 

5 
 
remaining four cheques as mentioned at Sr. No. 2 to 5 in the 
table, the same were returned to it unpaid with reason “payment 
stopped by drawer”. Details of deposit & return of cheques are as

3.6 Accordingly, the respondent filed two complaints under 
Section 190(i)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC” 
for short) for offences punishable under Section 138 & 142 of the 
N.I. Act, being C.C. No. 3151 of 2017 dated 30th November, 2016 
and C.C. No. 3150 of 2017 dated 23rd December, 2016, before the 
learned XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai.  

6 
 
3.7 Both the complaints have been filed against three accused 
persons namely, Fibtel Telecom Solutions, arrayed as Accused 
No. 1; Manju Sukumaran Lalitha, arrayed as Accused No. 2 & 
Susela Padmavathy Amma, the appellant herein, arrayed as 
Accused No. 3.  
3.8 Accused No. 3, who is a female senior citizen and the 
Director of Fibtel Telecom Solutions, filed Crl. O.P. No. 3470 of 
2019 against C.C. No. 3151 of 2017 & Crl. O.P. No. 5767 of 2019 
against C.C. No. 3150 of 2017, before the High Court under 
Section 482 of the CrPC for quashing of the criminal complaints 
qua her.  
3.9 Vide impugned judgment and order, dated 26th April, 2022, 
the High Court dismissed Crl. O.P. Nos. 3470 & 5767 of 2019 
and Crl. M.P. Nos. 2224, 2225 & 3255 of 2019, but directed the 
concerned trial court to dispose of the case within a period of 
three months.  

7 
 
3.10 Aggrieved by the rejection of the petition for quashing of 
criminal complaints, the appellant herein filed the present 
appeal.  
3.11 Vide order dated 12th December 2022, this Court had issued 
notice and stay of further proceedings qua the appellant was 
granted.  
4. 
We have heard Shri Manoj V. George, learned counsel for 
the appellant and Shri Lakshmeesh S. Kamath, learned counsel 
appearing for the respondent.  
5. 
Shri Manoj V. George, learned counsel for the appellant 
submitted that the appellant is an aged-lady and was not 
involved in the day-to-day affairs of the Company.  It is submitted 
that even in the complaint there are no averments that the 
appellant was in-charge of day-to-day affairs of the Company.  It 
is further submitted that the appellant was also not a signatory 
to the cheque in question.  It was only the accused No.2 who was 
the signatory to the cheque.   It is, therefore, submitted that the 
High Court has grossly erred in not allowing the petition for 

8 
 
quashing of criminal complaints qua the appellant.  Learned 
counsel relied on the judgments of this Court in the cases of N.K. 
Wahi 
vs. 
Shekhar 
Singh 
and 
others1, 
S.M.S. 
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs Neeta Bhalla and another2 Ashoke 
Mal Bafna vs. Upper India Steel Manufacturing and 
Engineering Company Limited3, Krishi Utpadan Mandi 
Samiti and others vs Pilibhit Pantnagar Beej Ltd. and 
another4 and Laxmi Dyechem vs. State of Gujarat and 
others5 in support of his submissions.  
6. 
Shri Lakshmeesh S. Kamath, learned counsel for the 
respondent, on the contrary, submitted that the learned judge of 
the High Court has rightly, after considering the material on 
record, dismissed the petition for quashing of criminal 
complaints qua the appellant.  It is submitted that the grounds 
raised are the defense of the accused and it can only be raised at 
 
1 (2007) 9 SCC 481 
2 (2005) 8 SCC 89 
3 (2018) 14 SCC 202 
4 (2004) 1 SCC 391 
5 (2012) 13 SCC 375 

9 
 
the stage of the trial.  It is, therefore, submitted that no 
interference is warranted in the present appeal.  
7. 
In the case of State of Haryana vs. Brij Lal Mittal and 
others6, this Court observed thus: 
“8. Nonetheless, we find that the impugned 
judgment of the High Court has got to be upheld 
for an altogether different reason. Admittedly, 
the three respondents were being prosecuted as 
directors of the manufacturers with the aid of 
Section 34(1) of the Act which reads as under: 
“34. Offences by companies.—(1) Where an 
offence under this Act has been committed by 
a company, every person who at the time the 
offence was committed, was in charge of, and 
was responsible to the company for the 
conduct of the business of the company, as 
well as the company shall be deemed to be 
guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be 
proceeded against and punished accordingly: 
Provided that nothing contained in this 
sub-section shall render any such person 
liable to any punishment provided in this 
Act if he proves that the offence was 
committed without his knowledge or that 
he exercised all due diligence to prevent the 
commission of such offence.” 
It is thus seen that the vicarious liability of a 
person for being prosecuted for an offence 
committed under the Act by a company arises if 
at the material time he was in charge of and was 
 
6 (1998) 5 SCC 343 

10 
 
also responsible to the company for the conduct 
of its business. Simply because a person is a 
director of the company it does not necessarily 
mean that he fulfils both the above requirements 
so as to make him liable. Conversely, without 
being a director a person can be in charge of and 
responsible to the company for the conduct of its 
business. From the complaint in question we, 
however, find that except a bald statement that 
the 
respondents 
were 
directors 
of 
the 
manufacturers, there is no other allegation to 
indicate, even prima facie, that they were in 
charge of the company and also responsible to 
the company for the conduct of its business.” 
 
8. 
It could thus be seen that this Court had held that simply 
because a person is a director of the company, it does not 
necessarily mean that he fulfils the twin requirements of Section 
34(1) of the said Act so as to make him liable.  It has been held 
that a person cannot be made liable unless, at the material time, 
he was in-charge of and was also responsible to the company for 
the conduct of its business.   
9. 
In the case of S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra), this 
Court was considering the question as to whether it was 
sufficient to make the person liable for being a director of a 
company under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 

11 
 
1881.  This Court considered the definition of the word “director” 
as defined in Section 2(13) of the Companies Act, 1956.  This 
Court observed thus: 
“8. ……. There is nothing which suggests that 
simply by being a director in a company, one 
is supposed to discharge particular functions 
on behalf of a company. It happens that a 
person may be a director in a company but he 
may not know anything about the day-to-day 
functioning of the company. As a director he 
may be attending meetings of the Board of 
Directors of the company where usually they 
decide policy matters and guide the course of 
business of a company. It may be that a Board 
of Directors may appoint sub-committees 
consisting of one or two directors out of the 
Board of the company who may be made 
responsible for the day-to-day functions of the 
company. These are matters which form part 
of resolutions of the Board of Directors of a 
company. Nothing is oral. What emerges from 
this is that the role of a director in a company 
is a question of fact depending on the peculiar 
facts in each case. There is no universal rule 
that a director of a company is in charge of its 
everyday affairs. We have discussed about the 
position of a director in a company in order to 
illustrate the point that there is no magic as 
such in a particular word, be it director, 
manager or secretary. It all depends upon the 
respective roles assigned to the officers in a 
company. …..” 
 

12 
 
10. It was held that merely because a person is a director of a 
company, it is not necessary that he is aware about the day-to-
day functioning of the company. This Court held that there is no 
universal rule that a director of a company is in charge of its 
everyday affairs.  It was, therefore, necessary, to aver as to how 
the director of the company was in charge of day-to-day affairs 
of the company or responsible to the affairs of the company.   
This Court, however, clarified that the position of a managing 
director or a joint managing director in a company may be 
different.  This Court further held that these persons, as the 
designation of their office suggests, are in charge of a company 
and are responsible for the conduct of the business of the 
company.  To escape liability, they will have to prove that when 
the offence was committed, they had no knowledge of the offence 
or that they exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission 
of the offence.   

13 
 
11. In the case of Pooja Ravinder Devidasani vs. State of 
Maharashtra and another7 this Court observed thus: 
“17. …… Every person connected with 
the Company will not fall into the ambit 
of the provision. Time and again, it has 
been asserted by this Court that only 
those persons who were in charge of and 
responsible for the conduct of the 
business of the Company at the time of 
commission of an offence will be liable for 
criminal action. A Director, who was not 
in charge of and was not responsible for 
the conduct of the business of the 
Company at the relevant time, will not be 
liable for an offence under Section 141 of 
the NI Act. In National Small Industries 
Corpn. [National Small Industries Corpn. 
Ltd. v. Harmeet Singh Paintal, (2010) 3 
SCC 330 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 677 : (2010) 
2 SCC (Cri) 1113] this Court observed: 
(SCC p. 336, paras 13-14) 
“13. Section 141 is a penal provision 
creating vicarious liability, and which, as 
per 
settled 
law, 
must 
be 
strictly 
construed. It is therefore, not sufficient to 
make a bald cursory statement in a 
complaint that the Director (arrayed as 
an 
accused) 
is 
in 
charge 
of 
and 
 
7 (2014) 16 SCC 1 

14 
 
responsible to the company for the 
conduct of the business of the company 
without anything more as to the role of 
the Director. But the complaint should 
spell out as to how and in what manner 
Respondent 1 was in charge of or was 
responsible to the accused Company for 
the conduct of its business. This is in 
consonance with strict interpretation of 
penal statutes, especially, where such 
statutes create vicarious liability. 
14. A company may have a number of 
Directors and to make any or all the 
Directors as accused in a complaint 
merely on the basis of a statement that 
they are in charge of and responsible for 
the conduct of the business of the 
company without anything more is not a 
sufficient or adequate fulfilment of the 
requirements under Section 141.” 
(emphasis in original) 
18. In Girdhari Lal Gupta v. D.H. Mehta 
[Girdhari Lal Gupta v. D.H. Mehta, (1971) 
3 SCC 189 : 1971 SCC (Cri) 279 : AIR 
1971 SC 2162] , this Court observed that 
a person “in charge of a business” means 
that the person should be in overall 
control of the day-to-day business of the 
Company. 

15 
 
19. A Director of a company is liable to be 
convicted for an offence committed by the 
company if he/she was in charge of and 
was responsible to the company for the 
conduct of its business or if it is proved 
that the offence was committed with the 
consent 
or 
connivance 
of, 
or 
was 
attributable to any negligence on the part 
of the Director concerned (see State of 
Karnataka v. Pratap Chand [State of 
Karnataka v. Pratap Chand, (1981) 2 SCC 
335 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 453] ). 
20. In other words, the law laid down by 
this Court is that for making a Director of 
a 
company 
liable 
for 
the 
offences 
committed by the company under Section 
141 of the NI Act, there must be specific 
averments against the Director showing 
as to how and in what manner the 
Director was responsible for the conduct 
of the business of the company. 
21. In Sabitha Ramamurthy v. R.B.S. 
Channabasavaradhya 
[Sabitha 
Ramamurthy 
v. 
R.B.S. 
Channabasavaradhya, (2006) 10 SCC 
581 : (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 621] , it was held 
by this Court that: (SCC pp. 584-85, para 
7) 
“7. … it is not necessary for the 
complainant to specifically reproduce the 

16 
 
wordings of the section but what is 
required is a clear statement of fact so as 
to enable the court to arrive at a prima 
facie 
opinion 
that 
the 
accused 
is 
vicariously liable. Section 141 raises a 
legal fiction. By reason of the said 
provision, a person although is not 
personally liable for commission of such 
an offence would be vicariously liable 
therefor. Such vicarious liability can be 
inferred so far as a company registered or 
incorporated under the Companies Act, 
1956 is concerned only if the requisite 
statements, which are required to be 
averred in the complaint petition, are 
made so as to make the accused therein 
vicariously 
liable 
for 
the 
offence 
committed by the company.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
By verbatim reproducing the words of the 
section without a clear statement of fact 
supported by proper evidence, so as to 
make the accused vicariously liable, is a 
ground 
for 
quashing 
proceedings 
initiated against such person under 
Section 141 of the NI Act.” 
 
12. It could thus clearly be seen that this Court has held that 
merely reproducing the words of the section without a clear 

17 
 
statement of fact as to how and in what manner a director of the 
company was responsible for the conduct of the business of the 
company, would not ipso facto make the director vicariously 
liable.   
13. A similar view has previously been taken by this Court in 
the case of K.K. Ahuja vs. V.K. Vora and another8.   
14. In the case of State of NCT of Delhi through Prosecuting 
Officer, Insecticides, Government of NCT, Delhi vs. Rajiv 
Khurana9, this Court reiterated the position thus: 
“17. The ratio of all these cases is that the 
complainant is required to state in the 
complaint how a Director who is sought to be 
made an accused, was in charge of the 
business of the company or responsible for 
the conduct of the company's business. Every 
Director need not be and is not in charge of 
the business of the company. If that is the 
position with regard to a Director, it is 
needless to emphasise that in the case of non-
Director officers, it is all the more necessary 
to 
state 
what 
were 
his 
duties 
and 
responsibilities in the conduct of business of 
the company and how and in what manner he 
is responsible or liable.” 
 
 
8 (2009) 10 SCC 48 
9 (2010) 11 SCC 469 

18 
 
15. In the case of Ashoke Mal Bafna (supra), this Court 
observed thus: 
“9. To fasten vicarious liability under 
Section 141 of the Act on a person, the 
law is well settled by this Court in a 
catena of cases that the complainant 
should specifically show as to how and in 
what 
manner 
the 
accused 
was 
responsible. Simply because a person is a 
Director of a defaulter Company, does not 
make him liable under the Act. Time and 
again, it has been asserted by this Court 
that only the person who was at the helm 
of affairs of the Company and in charge of 
and responsible for the conduct of the 
business at the time of commission of an 
offence will be liable for criminal action. 
(See Pooja Ravinder Devidasani v. State of 
Maharashtra [Pooja Ravinder Devidasani 
v. State of Maharashtra, (2014) 16 SCC 1 
: (2015) 3 SCC (Civ) 384 : (2015) 3 SCC 
(Cri) 378 : AIR 2015 SC 675] .) 
10. In other words, the law laid down by 
this Court is that for making a Director of 
a Company liable for the offences 
committed 
by 
the 
Company 
under 
Section 141 of the Act, there must be 
specific averments against the Director 
showing as to how and in what manner 

19 
 
the Director was responsible for the 
conduct of the business of the Company.” 
16. A similar view has been taken by this Court in the case of 
Lalankumar Singh and others vs. State of Maharashtra10 to 
which one of us (B.R. Gavai, J.) was a party.  
17. In the light of this settled legal position, let us examine the 
averments made in the complaints.   
18. It will be relevant to refer to para 16 of the complaint bearing 
No. CC 3151/2017 filed by the respondent before the Court of 
XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai dated 30th 
November 2016, which reads thus: 
“16. The Complainant states that the 
Accused has an intention of cheating the 
Complainant.  The 2nd and 3rd Accused 
herein has no intention to pay the dues that 
they owe to the Complainant. Instead, 
making the complainant believe that the 
same would be paid and through which 
trying to push the liability to future.  It is 
also pertinent to note that the 2nd and 3rd of 
the Accused herein are the Directors, 
promoters of the 1st Accused being the 
Company.  The 2nd of the Accused herein is 
the authorized signatory, who is in-charge 
 
10 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1383 

20 
 
of and responsible for the day to day affairs 
of the Company, the 1st Accused.” 
 
19. It can thus be seen that the only allegation against the 
present appellant is that the present appellant and the accused 
No.2 had no intention to pay the dues that they owe to the 
complainant.  It is stated that the 2nd accused and the 3rd accused 
(appellant herein) are the Directors, promoters of the 1st accused 
being the Company.  It is further averred that the 2nd accused is 
the authorized signatory, who is in-charge of and responsible for 
the day-to-day affairs of the Company, i.e., the 1st accused.   
20. It can thus be clearly seen that there is no averment to the 
effect that the present appellant is in-charge of and responsible 
for the day-to-day affairs of the Company.  It is also not the case 
of the respondent that the appellant is either the Managing 
Director or the Joint Managing Director of the Company.   
21. It can thus clearly be seen that the averments made are not 
sufficient to invoke the provisions of Section 141 of the N.I. Act 
qua the appellant. 

21 
 
22. In the result, we find that the present appeals deserve to be 
allowed.  It is ordered accordingly.  The judgment and order 
passed by the High Court dated 26th April, 2022 is quashed and 
set aside.  The proceedings in CC Nos. 3151 and 3150 of 2017 on 
the file of learned XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, 
Chennai (now transferred to the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, 
Fast Track Court-III, Saidapet, Chennai) in connection with the 
offence punishable under Section 138 read with Section 142 of 
the N.I. Act are quashed and set aside qua the present appellant.
