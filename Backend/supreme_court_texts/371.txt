2. 
There is no dispute that the lands of the appellants were 
irrigated lands. The land acquisition notification under Section 
4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was issued on 12th April, 
2007. The Special Land Acquisition Officer(S.L.A.O.) awarded 
compensation to the tune of Rs.1,31,263/- per acre to the land 
owners. 
3. 
The land owners preferred a reference and the Reference 
Court enhanced the compensation by fixing the market value of 
the land at Rs. 3,00,000/- per acre. 
4. 
Aggrieved by the same, the beneficiaries being respondent- 
Karnaktaka Neravari Nigam Ltd. filed M.F.A. No. 100175 of 2014 
before the High Court of Karnataka, Dharwad Bench wherein, the 
appellant-claimants filed cross-objections seeking enhancement 
of compensation. 
5. 
In the High Court, the cross-objectors i.e. appellants herein 
contended that in another M.F.A. No. 23768 of 2013, the High 
Court had awarded compensation by fixing the market value at 
Rs. 3,69,000/- per acre along with statutory benefits so far as the 
irrigated lands are concerned. 
6. 
The said matter arose out of an acquisition notification of 
the years 2004-2005 and the order passed by the High Court has 

 
3 
 
been confirmed by this Court with dismissal of Special Leave 
Petition(C) No. 8107 of 2016 filed by the beneficiary. 
7. 
Shri Anand Sanjay M. Nuli, learned senior counsel 
representing the appellants drew the Court’s attention to an order 
dated 17th April, 2021 passed by the learned Single Judge of the 
High Court of Karnataka wherein, for the very same project, the 
land owners had been awarded compensation at the rate of 
Rs.5,00,000/- per acre in respect of lands which are covered 
under the notifications issued between 2004-2008. He, thus, 
urged that the appellants are entitled to the same relief. 
8. 
 Per contra, Mr. Navin R. Nath, learned senior counsel 
representing the respondent-beneficiary pointed out that the High 
Court committed a glaring error in construing the affidavit filed 
by the respondents in MFA No.101083 of 2016. He urged that in 
the said matter, the affidavit which was filed pertained to an 
acquisition of 2009, wherein the Reference Court had determined 
compensation at the rate of Rs.5,00,000/- per acre. 
9. 
 Having 
given 
our 
thoughtful 
consideration 
to 
the 
submissions advanced at bar and after going through the 
material available on record, we find that the respondents 
themselves have agreed to award the market value at the rate of 
Rs. 3,69,000/- per acre along with statutory benefits for the lands 

 
4 
 
acquired under the notification of the years 2004-2005. 
10. For the market value fixed in the years 2004-2005 at the 
rate of Rs.3,69,000/- per acre, an escalation of 5 per cent per 
year has already been applied. 
11. For the lands acquired in the year 2009, the market value 
had been fixed by the Reference Court at Rs. 5,00,000/- per acre 
and above. 
12. The lands of the appellants herein were acquired in the year 
2007.  
13. In this background, we feel that ends of justice would be met 
if the market value of the lands acquired from the appellants is 
fixed at Rs. 4,50,000/- per acre by modifying the order dated 2nd 
February, 2018 passed by the High Court. 
14. Accordingly, we hereby direct that the appellant-claimants 
shall be entitled to compensation towards the acquired lands at 
the rate of Rs. 4,50,000/- per acre with all statutory benefits, 
interest and costs. However, the direction of the High Court to 
deny interest for the period of delay in filing the cross-objections 
is sustained.   
15. This order is being passed in peculiar facts of the present 
case and shall not be treated as precedent. 
16. The appeals are allowed in the above terms. 

 
5 
 
17. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
