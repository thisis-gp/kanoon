FACTUAL ASPECTS 
1. 
The appellant was appointed as a contractor to construct 
a minor bridge.  The contract was granted by the first 
respondent–State of Madhya Pradesh.  The second respondent, 
Executive Engineer, National Highway Division Sagar, Madhya 
Pradesh, rescinded the contract by the letter dated 9th 
November 2001.  Clause 29 in the work order incorporated an 
arbitration clause.  The appellant requested for constitution of 
an Arbitral Board.  The said request was rejected.  Even the 
subsequent representation was rejected.  Therefore, the 
appellant applied for a reference to the Madhya Pradesh 
Arbitration Tribunal, Bhopal (for short, ‘the Arbitration 
Tribunal’) in accordance with Section 7 of the Madhya Pradesh 
Madhyastham Adhikaran Adhiniyam, 1983 (for short, ‘the

1983 Act’).  By the order dated 19th April 2010, the Arbitration 
Tribunal concluded that as there was an arbitration clause in 
the contract, the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation 
Act, 1996 (for short, ‘the Arbitration Act’) would apply.  The 
Tribunal held that only when there is no arbitration clause, the 
provisions of the 1983 Act would apply.  In view of this order, 
the appellant filed a petition under Section 11(6) of the 
Arbitration Act before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at 
Jabalpur.  The petition was allowed, and a retired District 
Judge was appointed as the Arbitrator.  An award was made 
on 25th April 2014 by the learned Arbitrator.   
2. 
The respondents, aggrieved by the said award, preferred 
a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act before the 
District Judge, Jabalpur.  The learned District Judge dismissed 
the said petition.  The respondents filed an appeal under 
Section 37 of the Arbitration Act before the High Court for 
challenging the order of the District Court.  By the impugned 
judgment, the High Court proceeded to set aside the award only 
on the ground that as held by this Court in the case of Madhya 
Pradesh Rural Road Development Authority & Anr. v. L. G. 
Chaudhary Engineers and Contractors1, the provisions of 
the 1983 Act were applicable. 
SUBMISSIONS 
3. 
  The learned counsel appearing for the appellant invited 
our attention to the fact that the decision in the case of 
 
1  (2018) 10 SCC 826 

 
   Civil Appeal No.8528-8529 of 2024 
 
Page 3 of 7 
 
 
Madhya Pradesh Rural Road Development Authority1 was 
rendered nearly four years after the date of the award.  
However, in paragraph 17 of the said decision, this Court 
observed that if an award is already made by the Arbitrator and 
if the objection to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator was not 
raised at an appropriate stage, the award may not be annulled 
only on that ground.  The learned counsel submitted that the 
respondents did not challenge the order passed by the High 
Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act.  The objection 
regarding the jurisdiction of the arbitration was raised only in 
the written submissions.  He would, therefore, submit that the 
award could not have been set aside based on the decision of 
this Court. 
4. 
The learned counsel appearing for the respondents 
submitted that, as seen from the award, a contention was 
raised in the written statement filed before the Arbitrator that 
the appellant should have taken recourse to Section 7 of the 
1983 Act.  Therefore, the dispute was raised at the appropriate 
stage, and hence, paragraph 17 of the decision in the case of 
Madhya Pradesh Rural Road Development Authority1 will 
have no application. 
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS  
5. 
A few factual aspects will have to be noted.  After the 
contract granted to the appellant was rescinded, the appellant 
invoked Section 7 of the 1983 Act by approaching the 
Arbitration Tribunal.  By the order dated 19th April 2010, the 
Arbitration Tribunal held that in view of the arbitration clause 

 
   Civil Appeal No.8528-8529 of 2024 
 
Page 4 of 7 
 
 
in the contract, the 1983 Act will have no application and the 
appellant will have to take recourse to the Arbitration Act.  In 
view of this order, the appellant invoked the jurisdiction of the 
High Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act by filing 
a petition for the appointment of an Arbitrator.  The order dated 
22nd July 2011 passed by the High Court on the said petition 
shows that the respondents' opposition was only on the merits 
of the claim.  The objection based on the applicability of the 
1983 Act was not raised. The respondents did not challenge the 
order of appointment of the Arbitrator passed by the High 
Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act.  Even before 
the learned Arbitrator, Section 16(1) of the Arbitration Act was 
not invoked to raise the jurisdiction issue. However, in the 
written statement filed before the Arbitrator, the contention 
regarding the applicability of the 1983 Act was raised.  
6. 
Now, coming to the decision of this Court in the case of 
Madhya Pradesh Rural Road Development Authority1, after 
considering the provisions of the 1983 Act and the Arbitration 
Act, in the light of Section 2(4) of the Arbitration Act, this Court 
held that although there was an arbitration clause, the 1983 
Act would apply.  In paragraph 17, this Court held thus: 
“17. We do not express any opinion on 
the applicability of the State Act where 
award has already been made. In such 
cases if no objection to the jurisdiction 
of the arbitration was taken at relevant 
stage, the award may not be annulled 
only on that ground.”

7. 
As noted earlier, in the facts of the case, before taking 
recourse to the Arbitration Act, the appellant had taken 
recourse to Section 7 of the 1983 Act. The order of the 
Arbitration Tribunal, holding that the Arbitration Act will 
apply, led the appellant to file a petition under Section 11(6) of 
the Arbitration Act, which was not objected to on the grounds 
of the applicability of the 1983 Act.  The objection of the State 
government was confined to the merits of the claim. The award 
is only in the sum of Rs. 6,52,235/- with interest. The award 
was made on 25th April 2014. Therefore, in the facts of the case, 
it will be unjust to set aside the award only on the ground of 
the failure of the appellant to take recourse to the 1983 Act.  In 
fact, the appellant had taken recourse to the 1983 Act before 
seeking the appointment of an Arbitrator.  In this case, as can 
be seen from the impugned judgment, the award has been set 
aside only on the ground that the appellant ought to have 
invoked the provisions of the 1983 Act.  Even assuming that 
the observations in paragraph 17 of the decision in the case of 
Madhya Pradesh Rural Road Development Authority1, are 
not applicable, this is a fit case to exercise jurisdiction under 
Article 142 of the Constitution of India to ensure that complete 
justice is done.   Therefore, by setting aside the impugned 
judgment, the appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act 
will have to be restored with a request to the High Court to 
decide the same on merits. 
8. 
Accordingly, the impugned judgment dated 12th May 
2022 passed in the Review Petition no.584 of 2021, and the 

 
   Civil Appeal No.8528-8529 of 2024

order dated 5th July 2021 passed in the Arbitration Appeal 
no.45 of 2019 are set aside.  The Arbitration Appeal no.45 of 
2019 is restored to the file of the High Court of Madhya 
Pradesh, Principal Seat at Jabalpur.  The restored appeal shall 
be listed before the roster bench on Monday, the 30th 
September 2024.  The parties to the appeal shall appear before 
the High Court on that day, and no further notice of the date 
fixed in the appeal shall be given to the parties.  On 30th 
September 2024, the High Court will fix a date for hearing the 
restored appeal, which shall be heard and decided in 
accordance with law and in light of the observations made in 
this judgment.  All the issues on the merits of the restored 
appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act are kept open.  
However, the award should not be set aside on the grounds of 
the applicability of the 1983 Act. 
9. 
If the appellant has withdrawn the amount paid as per 
the award, the same shall be deposited by the appellant with 
the High Court within two months from today. The amount 
shall be invested by the High Court in a fixed deposit with any 
nationalised bank till the disposal of the restored appeal. The 
High Court, while deciding the appeal, shall pass appropriate 
directions regarding the withdrawal of the amount with interest 
accrued thereon. 
10. 
Subject to the observations made above, the appeals are 
allowed.
