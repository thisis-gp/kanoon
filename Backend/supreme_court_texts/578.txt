Originally, the appellant filed a claim petition in MAC No.1587 of
2013  before  the  Senior  Civil  Judge  &  MACT at  Raibag  (hereinafter
shortly  referred  to  as  "the  Tribunal"),  seeking  a  compensation  of
Rs.20,00,000/- for the injuries sustained by him in a motor accident that
had occurred on  27.01.2013, while he was travelling as a pillion rider in
the motor cycle bearing registration No.KA-23/EC-6369 insured with the
insurance company. Based on the oral and documentary evidence, the
Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.5,38,872/- along with interest at 6% p.a.
from the date of petition till deposit, as compensation payable to the
appellant, after taking into account the disability sustained by him at
25%. Aggrieved by the same, the insurance company filed an appeal in
MFA No.103118 of 2014 (MV) before the High Court.  
5.
After  hearing  both  sides,  the  High  Court  re-assessed  the
compensation  by  reducing  it  to  Rs.4,74,072/-  by  taking  into
consideration, disability only at 20% and allowed the appeal in part, by
the final judgment dated 13.11.2018, which is under challenge before us.
6.
The learned counsel for the appellant, drawing the attention of
this court to Exs.P56 to 60, medical records pertaining to the appellant,
2

submitted that the appellant sustained three injuries viz., fracture of right
radius, fracture of left radius and fracture of styloid process of ulna, for
which, he had undergone surgery and plates and screws were implanted
in  his  both  hands.  The  doctor  N.Y.  Joshi  gave  Ex.P57,  disability
certificate to the effect that the appellant suffered 50% disability, as a
whole. Based on the same, the Tribunal determined the compensation
under  the  head  'Loss  of  future  income'  by  taking  into  account  the
disability  at  25%.  However,  the  High  Court  re-determined  the
compensation by reducing the disability suffered by the appellant to 20%,
by observing that the doctor who issued the disability certificate had not
been  examined  before  the  Tribunal,  which  is  erroneous.  It  is  also
submitted  that  the  appellant,  being  an  agriculturist,  is  unable  to  do
agricultural operations, due to the disability suffered by him. Therefore,
the learned counsel sought our interference in the judgment passed by
the High Court and thereby enhance the compensation payable to the
appellant.
7.
On  the  other  hand,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  insurance
company submitted that the High Court has awarded a just and fair
compensation to the appellant, considering the facts and circumstances
3

of the case and hence, prayed for dismissal of this appeal.
8.
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused
the record.
9.
The only issue that arises for our consideration is, whether the
High Court is right in reducing the percentage of disability suffered by the
appellant from 25% as fixed by the Tribunal, to 20% while determining
the compensation payable to him. 
10.
The factum of accident and the involvement of the motorcycle
insured with the insurance company, are not disputed. From a perusal of
the records, viz., Exs.P56 to P60 - medical records of the appellant, more
particularly, Ex.P56 wound certificate, it is evident that the appellant
sustained the following injuries in the accident:
(i)Displaced fracture upper 1/3rd of the shaft of right radius and
ulnar shafts and bone of the right forearm. 
(ii)Fracture of ulnar stoiloid and evidence of angulated fracture of
distal end of left radius.
4

Further,  for  the  above  injuries,  the  appellant  underwent  a
surgery, in which, plates and screws were implanted in his hands. As per
Ex.P57 disability certificate issued by the doctor, N.Y. Joshi, the appellant
suffered  50%  permanent  disablement  and  the  said  doctor  was  also
examined  as  PW2.  Considering  all  these  oral  and  documentary
evidence, the Tribunal has taken the disability of the appellant only at
25%  and  determined  the  compensation  payable  to  him.  Without
assigning  plausible  reason,  the  High  Court  re-assessed  the
compensation by reducing the disability suffered by the appellant to 20%.
We are of the view that the reduction of compensation was not required,
particularly, when there is no basis in support thereof. Therefore, the
judgment passed by the High Court is liable to be interfered with. 
 
11.
Accordingly, the impugned judgment dated 13.11.2018 passed
by the High Court in MFA No.103118 of 2014 (MV) is set aside and the
judgment dated 28.06.2014 passed by the Tribunal in MAC No.1587 of
2013  fixing  the  disability  of  the  appellant  at  25%  is  restored.  The
insurance company is directed to deposit the entire compensation along
with interest as determined by the Tribunal, after adjusting the amounts
5

already deposited, before the Tribunal, within a period of four weeks from
the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. On such deposit being
made, the appellant is permitted to withdraw the same.
12.
This Civil Appeal is allowed.
