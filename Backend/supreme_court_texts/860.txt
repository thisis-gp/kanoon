1.
Delay condoned.
2. 
This petition arises from the Order passed by the High
Court of Judicature at Bombay, Bench at Aurangabad in Writ
Petition No.15056 of 2019 dated 12th April, 2024 by which
the High Court allowed the petition filed by the original
plaintiff  (respondent  no.1  herein)  and  thereby  set  aside
the order passed by the Joint Civil Judge, Junior Division,
Jamkhed  condoning  the  delay  of  4½  years  in  filing  the
written statement.
3.
The petitioners herein are the original defendants and

defendants failed to file their written statement in time
the stage to file written statement was closed. Thereafter
permission of the Trial Court was prayed for to file the
written statement after a period of over 4½ years.  The
Trial Court permitted the defendants to file their written
statement. The plaintiff being dissatisfied with the same
challenged the order passed by the Trial Court permitting
the defendants to file written statement after a period of
4½  years.   The  High  Court  allowed  the  petition  and  set
aside the order passed by the trial court.
5.
We find no error not to speak of any error of law in
the impugned judgment passed by the High Court.
6.
We  have  noticed  over  a  period  of  time  the  growing
tendency  on  the  part  of  the  litigants  in  throwing  the
entire blame on the head of the advocate.  Not only this,
we have come across cases where the concerned advocate has
filed an affidavit in favour of his client(s) saying that
he  was  unable  to  attend  the  proceedings  due  to  some
personal  reasons  difficulties  thereby  facilitating  the
litigant to get the delay condoned.
7.
Even  if  we  assume  for  a  moment  that  the  concerned

lawyer was careless or negligent, this, by itself, cannot
be a ground to condone long and inordinate delay as the
litigant owes a duty to be vigilant of his own rights and
is  expected  to  be  equally  vigilant  about  the  judicial
proceedings pending in the court initiated at his instance.
8.
The  litigant,  therefore,  should  not  be  permitted  to
throw  the  entire  blame  on  the  head  of  the  advocate  and
thereby disown him at any time and seek relief.  
9.
In view of the aforesaid, petition fails and is hereby
dismissed.
10.
Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.
