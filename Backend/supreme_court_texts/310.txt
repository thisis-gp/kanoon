had sought for suspension of sentence and grant 
of bail through these Appeals on the primary 
ground that they are in jail for more than ten 
years. Also, two co-accused Pramod Kashyap and 
Adesh Kumar had been granted bail by co-
ordinate bench of same High Court. By the 
Impugned order, the three Applicants- Arvind 
Kumar, Chandra Kumar @ Chandu and Rishi 
Kumar were granted bail during the pendency of 
their 
Criminal 
appeals, 
with 
condition of 
furnishing a personal bond in the sum of 
Rs.50,000/- each (Fifty Thousand) along with 
two sureties. Appellant is the Complainant and 
has challenged the order of granting bail through 
these appeals. 
3. 
The three Applicants have filed separate Criminal 
Appeals before High Court against order of 
Sessions Court dated 06.06.2019 whereby total

five Accused namely, Arvind Kumar, Chandra 
Kumar @ Chandu, Rishi Kumar, Pramod 
Kashyap and Adesh Kumar were convicted under 
Sections 147, 148, 302/149 and 120B of Indian 
Penal Code, 18601. They were sentenced for life 
imprisonment under Section 302/149 of IPC 
along with fine of Rs. 20,000/-. By the same 
order two other accused- Monu and Amit Kumar 
were acquitted of all the Charges.  
4. 
The brief facts leading to these appeals are as 
follows: 
4.1 On 11.02.2011, the appellant/Complainant- 
Jadunath Singh submitted a Written Report 
narrating 
the 
incident 
leading 
to 
present 
Criminal case. He stated that in Village Bhogaon 
there is a plot illegally taken by Arvind Kumar 
(accused- respondent). He was removed from its 
illegal 
possession 
by 
Rajvir, 
son 
of 
the

Complainant, in accordance with the order of 
District Magistrate.  
4.2 On the same day around 11.45 AM, Complainant 
Jadunath Singh along with his son Rajvir, Pawan 
Kumar, Rawan Kumar, Upendra, Chedalal were 
sitting together, discussing the disputed plot. At 
this time, Arvind Kumar, armed with country 
made pistol (katta of 315 bore), his two sons-
Chandra Kumar @ Chandu armed with katta and 
Rishi Kumar armed with katta along with Amit 
Kumar, armed with a rifle and two unknown 
persons with rifles, arrived there in white 
coloured Maruti 800 Car and immediately opened 
fire at the complainant and all other persons 
sitting with him.  
4.3 The Complainant and others ran into a nearby 
building owned by one Harvilas. They were 
chased 
by 
accused 
persons 
along 
with 
continuous firing. They managed to intrude in 
the room in which Rajvir and Pawan entered 
while hiding and escaping from the shots. There 
the accused aimed at Rajvir and Pawan, shot 
them dead and thus caused the death of both 
these victims and also injured Ravita- daughter 

SLP(CRL.) NOS.7961-7963 OF 2023

in law of Harvilas, causing injuries upon her. 
Thereafter the accused persons fled away. The 
injured persons were taken to Hospital.  
4.4 The Medical Officer on duty declared Rajvir and 
Pawan 
Kumar 
as 
brought 
dead. 
Ravita’s 
treatment is under process. As per testimony of 
Dr. Ankit Nikant, Pawan’s death was caused by 
fire arm injury on his chest and excessive 
bleeding from the same. Rajvir’s death is caused 
from excessive bleeding from the 9 firearm 
wounds found on his body. Two injuries were 
found on Rajvir’s shoulder and one injury was on 
his chest.  
5. 
On the basis of the complaint given by Jadunath 
Singh (Appellant), FIR No. 1411 of 2011 was 
registered 
at 
Police 
Station 
Kotwali 
Dist. 
Mainpuri under Sections 147, 148, 149, 302, 
307, 120B of IPC against five named accused and 
two unknown. After investigation Chargesheet 
was submitted against all the seven accused. 
However, three separate trials were registered 

SLP(CRL.) NOS.7961-7963 OF 2023 
 
Page 6 of 12 
 
being Session Trial No. 48 of 2013- State of U.P. 
vs Chandra Kumar and three others, namely 
Pramod Kashyap, Aadesh Kumar and Monu, 
Session Trial No. 321 of 2013- State of U.P. vs 
Arvind Kumar and Rishi Kumar and Session Trial 
No. 531 of 2013- State of U.P. vs Amit Kumar. 
The trials were clubbed and the leading case was 
ascertained as Sessions Trial No. 48 of 2013- 
State vs Chandra Kumar and three others. 
6. 
Trial Court after appreciating the evidence led 
during the trial, convicted five accused namely 
Arvind 
Kumar, 
Chandra 
Kumar, 
Pramod 
Kashyap, Rishi Kumar and Aadesh Kumar under 
Section 302/149, 147, 148 and 120-B of IPC and 
awarded life sentence. It, however, acquitted two 
other accused namely Monu and Amit Kumar of 
all the charges.

7. 
At this juncture it is relevant to note another 
criminal case involving some of the present 
convicted accused. On 31.01.2013, two accused 
viz Rishi Kumar and Chandra Kumar were 
produced before Sessions Court at Mainpuri, 
while in judicial custody by Constable Ajay 
Kumar. The two accused persons requested the 
police constable Ajay Kumar to take them out for 
attending nature’s call. The police constable Ajay 
Kumar went along with two accused persons 
along with family members in a Maruti Car. As 
soon as they moved out from the Court campus, 
the two accused Chandra Kumar and Rishi 
Kumar opened fire on said police constable Ajay 
Kumar due to which said constable died on the 
spot and thereafter his dead body was thrown by 
the accused persons in front of the house of one 
Munshi Lal. Consequently, an FIR being Case 

SLP(CRL.) NOS.7961-7963 OF 2023 
 
Page 8 of 12 
 
Crime No.60 of 2013 was registered under 
Section 302 IPC. Charge sheet No. 29 of 2013 
dated 27.07.2013 was also filed against eight 
accused persons- Rishi Kumar, Chandra Kumar, 
Sudha- wife of Rishi Kumar, Babli- wife of 
Chandra Kumar, Dharmveer, Monu, Jayshree 
and Ravindra Singh under Sections 302, 201, 
120B, 34, 224 of IPC, with allegation that all eight 
accused hatched conspiracy for committing 
murder of Police Constable Ajay Kumar. The 
accused Chandra Kumar and Rishi Kumar 
absconded and were later on arrested by STF 
from Maharashtra where also they had opened 
fire on the police party for which a separate FIR 
Case Crime No. 54 of 2013. 
8. 
Thus, Complainant has challenged the impugned 
order of granting bail on primary ground that the 
accused persons are dreaded criminals as 

SLP(CRL.) NOS.7961-7963 OF 2023 
 
Page 9 of 12 
 
initially they have committed two murders and 
later co-accused Chandra Kumar and Rishi 
Kumar, the sons of co-accused Arvind Kumar 
killed a Police Constable Ajay Kumar while he 
was on duty during the course of trial. Therefore, 
Complainant fears that after being released from 
jail, they will hatch another conspiracy for 
eliminating the complainant and his family 
members. 
9. 
We have heard learned counsel for the parties 
and perused the material on record.  
10. 
The High Court has granted bail taking into 
consideration the following two factors: 
i) 
Period of incarceration; 
ii) 
Two other co-accused have been granted 
bail. 
11. 
It appears that before the High Court, the fact 
relating to the murder of Ajay Kumar Police 
Constable in 
whose custody the accused 

SLP(CRL.) NOS.7961-7963 OF 2023 
 
Page 10 of 12 
 
Chandra Kumar and Rishi Kumar were produced 
before the Trial Court at Mainpuri and further, 
the fact that they had absconded after throwing 
the dead body of deceased Constable Ajay Kumar 
and later on arrested by Special Task Force (STF) 
from Maharashtra and during their arrest also 
they had resisted and opened fire on the police 
party for which a separate case was registered. 
Such facts have not been placed before the High 
Court. These were relevant facts which ought to 
have been placed before the High Court. The 
parity mentioned by the High Court in the 
impugned order relating to Adesh Kumar and 
Pramod Kashyap was clearly distinguishable not 
only with respect to their role in the case in hand 
but also, they were not involved in the murder of 
Ajay Kumar Police Constable. 

SLP(CRL.) NOS.7961-7963 OF 2023

12. 
In 
our 
considered 
opinion, 
two 
accused 
respondents namely Chandra Kumar and Rishi 
Kumar despite their period of incarceration of 
more than 10 years would not be entitled to grant 
of bail for their subsequent conduct for which 
they are facing separate trial.  
13. 
Insofar as Arvind Kumar is concerned, he is not 
charge sheeted in the murder case of Ajay Kumar 
as such we are not inclined to interfere with the 
order of the High Court granting bail to him i.e. 
Arvind Kumar. However, insofar as the other two 
accused Rishi Kumar and Chandra Kumar are 
concerned, their bail deserves to be cancelled.  
14. 
Accordingly, the appeal against Arvind Kumar 
is dismissed, and other two appeals i.e. 
against Chandra Kumar and Rishi Kumar are 
allowed. The impugned order of the High Court 
granting bail to Rishi Kumar and Chandra 

SLP(CRL.) NOS.7961-7963 OF 2023

Kumar is set aside. They may surrender within 
two weeks failing which the High court will take 
appropriate steps for taking them into custody 
using coercive measures as are permissible 
under law.
