A.  
CASE OF THE PROSECUTION 
2. 
The appellant herein (Original Accused No. 2) at the relevant point of time 
was serving as a Sales’ Manager of one ‘M/s Oriental Motors, Bathinda, Punjab’ 
(“Company”). He is alleged to have conspired with the other co-accused to cheat 
the Punjab and Sindh Bank at Sangha, Punjab (“Bank”), by securing vehicle 
loans on the basis of sham vehicle sales to the tune of Rs. 8,30,000/-, and then 
diverting and apportioning the said sum amongst themselves. The loan facilities 
that were sanctioned by the bank were not utilised by the company for the 
purposes for which they were sanctioned, and instead the funds were diverted for 
personal benefits. 
 
3. 
It appears from the material on record that in the year 1987-88 the company 
referred to above through the appellant and a partner of the said company 
(Original Accused No. 3) executed the loan documents on behalf of ten loanees 
under the pretext of purchasing ten pick-up vehicles from the said company. The 
Manager of the bank referred above (Original Accused No. 1), sanctioned these 
loans without scrutinizing the documents, and disbursed the loan amount by ten 
demand drafts.  
 
4. 
The said ten demand drafts were credited in the current account of the 
company and the said amount was subsequently withdrawn by all the accused 
persons including the appellant. It is relevant to mention that these ten loanees in 

Criminal Appeal No. 870 of 2010  
 
Page 3 of 9 
 
whose name the loans were sanctioned in the first place were illiterate persons to 
whom these vehicles were never supplied by the company.  
 
5. 
The case against the appellant is that he was instrumental in securing the 
said loans by misusing his position and signing off the loan documents. He had 
prepared the documents and issued bogus invoices showing sale of vehicles to 
the loanees by the Company, when in fact no vehicle was ever delivered. The 
appellant then filled up the demand drafts / pay-in slips which were disbursed by 
the Bank in the name of the loanees and credited the sum into the company’s bank 
account, which were later withdrawn and misappropriated, and thus, the appellant 
is said to have caused wrongful gain by swindling the bank to the tune of Rs. 
8,30,000/- by a conspiracy hatched with a fraudulent intention. 
 
6. 
In the aforesaid context, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) 
registered a case vide R.C. No. 1/90 against the three accused persons including 
the appellant herein for the offence under Section(s) 120B, 420, 467 and 468 of 
IPC r.w. Section 5(1)(d) and 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (for 
short, the “Act, 1988”) 
 
7. 
Upon conclusion of the investigation by the CBI, chargesheet was filed in 
the court of the Special Judge, CBI, Patiala, on 13.06.1992, against all accused 
persons. Thereafter the aforesaid charges were framed. None of the accused 
persons pleaded guilty & claimed to be tried.

appellant in the entire conspiracy by observing that he was instrumental in getting 
the vehicle loans of the ten loanees. It observed that it was the appellant who in 
fact introduced the loanees to the Bank, issued the bogus invoices of vehicles to 
them, deposited the margin money on their behalf and prepared the pay-in slips 
vide which the loan amount was credited in the account of the company. The 
relevant observations read as under: - 
“Appellant Jagjit Singh worked as Sales Manager of M/s. Oriental 
Motors. He was instrumental in getting ten transport vehicle loans 
of the loanees, afore - mentioned. He deposited margin money on 
their behalf. He introduced the loanees to the Bank. He issued bogus 
invoices/sales letters showing sale of vehicles to the loanees, when 
in fact no vehicle was delivered to them. The amounts were credited 
to the account of M/s. Oriental Motors vide pay- in slips prepared by 
appellant Jagjit Singh. The five loanees examined by the prosecution 
stated that they did not deposit the margin money in their accounts 
in the Bank. The pay-in slips were filled up in the handwriting of 
appellant Jagjit Singh vide which money was credited to the account 
of M/s. Oriental motors, Bathinda. Appellant Jagjit Singh had thus 
active role to play in the criminal conspiracy under which the loan 
amounts were credited to the account of M/s Oriental Motors, 
Bathinda.”

and when the criminal proceeding was initiated in 1990, he was the sole 
breadwinner in the family. In 1992, during investigation and the ongoing trial, he 
was removed from service for his misconduct, and owing to the pendency of the 
criminal case, he was unable to find another job.

of which was spent in covering the costs of litigation of the ongoing trial. That he 
along with his family are completely dependent on his wife’s pension for taking 
care of their basic needs, and that aside from her pension neither of them have 
any other source of income.
