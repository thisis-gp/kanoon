aside the acquittal recorded by the Trial Court on

Code of Criminal Procedure, 19731 and thereafter 
proceed to decide the trial.  
Brief facts relating to the present case are: 
3. That the First Information Report2 was lodged by 
respondent no.2 alleging that the appellant had 
tried to kidnap him which was registered under 
sections 366/323/506(II) of the Indian Penal 
Code, 18603 with section 25(1)(B)(a) of the Arms 
Act, 1950 as FIR No. 125 on 11.10.2017. After 
investigation, a charge-sheet was submitted on 
08.02.2019 under the aforesaid sections. 
4. During the trial the Examination-in-Chief of the 
victim (respondent no.2) PW1, her mother Sabiya 
Rahaman (PW 2) and her father Aslam Shaikh 
(PW 3) were recorded.  However, their cross-
examination was deferred on an application 
made 
by 
the 
accused-appellant. 
The 
Examination-in-Chief 
was 
conducted 
on 
29.02.2020.  On 07.03.2020 an application 
under section 319 CrPC was filed by respondent 
no.2 for further summoning the father and

3 IPC

mother of the accused-appellant.  Thereafter it 
appears that the above three prosecution 
witnesses did not appear before the Trial Court 
for their cross-examination despite having 
received the summons. On 14.09.2020 again an 
adjournment was sought on behalf of PWs 1, 2 
and 3 whereupon the Trial Court recorded that 
despite 
the 
specific 
repeated 
orders, 
the 
prosecution witnesses are not coming forward for 
cross-examination and that the witnesses as 
such are wilfully disobeying the orders of the 
Court. The Trial Court directed that the cross-
examination of the witnesses is fixed for the next 
date and orders would be passed on the 
application under section 319 CrPC after the 
examination of all the witnesses are over. The 
order 
dated 
14.09.2020 
is 
reproduced 
hereunder: 
“Today is fixed for cross-examination of PW 
1, PW2 and PW 3. Sole accused Asim Akhtar 
is present by filing hazira. SR of summons 
are received after service.  On behalf of the 
defacto complainant a petition has been filed 
praying for disposal of the application under 

SLP(Crl.) No.12292 of 2022  
 
Page 4 of 14 
 
section 319 CrPC with affidavit.  Copy is seen 
by the PP in charge. 
On behalf of the PW 1 PW 2 and PW 3 a 
petition has been filed for an adjournment 
with xerox copy of prescription Copy is also 
seen by the PP in charge. 
Perused the petition.  Heard both sides. 
Admittedly, the petition has been filed by 
the de facto complainant with an affidavit.  
The affidavit is sworn at Sealdah Court on 
14.09.2020 before the Notary Public Sarbani 
Mitra but the said witness failed to appear 
before the court. That factum goes to show 
that the said witness wilfully disobeyed the 
order of court.  The application under section 
319 CrPC is heard in presence of both sides. 
The 
order 
will 
be 
passed 
after 
the 
examination of all the witnesses are over. 
Tomorrow for examination and cross 
examination of all the witnesses and order to 
respect the application under section 319 
CrPC.” 
 
5. On 15.09.2020 again the witnesses remained 
absent and filed an application for adjournment.  

SLP(Crl.) No.12292 of 2022  
 
Page 5 of 14 
 
They also moved an application seeking four 
weeks’ time to bring appropriate orders from the 
High Court regarding no adverse orders being 
passed in case of non-appearance of parties 
owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet another 
application was filed for giving a direction to the 
concerned authority to issue urgent certified 
copy of the order passed by the High Court.   
6. The Trial Court recorded in detail the past 
conduct of the PWs 1, 2 and 3 that despite the 
service of summons, they had not been 
appearing for cross-examination. It was also 
recorded that PW 1 – the complainant had come 
to the Court with a sworn affidavit in her 
application under section 319 CrPC but did not 
care to attend the trial proceedings and present 
herself for cross-examination.   
7. The Trial Court further proceeded to record that 
although the complainant wants the trial to 
proceed but is not coming forward for being 
cross-examined and has only filed an application 
to the effect that the application under section 
319 CrPC may be heard and decided before the 
cross-examination.  Even the Public Prosecutor 

SLP(Crl.) No.12292 of 2022  
 
Page 6 of 14 
 
had opposed the application filed by the de facto 
complainant for hearing of the 319 CrPC 
application.  He also stated that other witnesses 
are coming and returning because of the 
repeated absence of PWs 1,2 and 3.  The Trial 
Court 
thus 
fixed 
29.09.2020 
for 
cross-
examination and also recorded its displeasure 
and inclination to execute the bailable warrants 
of arrest against the witnesses.  It directed the 
Public Prosecutor to ensure presence of the 
witnesses and also directed the Investigating 
Officer to remain present with the witnesses.  
8. Again on 21.09.2020 the sole accused – appellant 
was present.  An application was filed by the 
complainant-respondent 
no.2 
stating 
that 
aggrieved by the orders dated 14.09.2020 and 
15.09.2020 
she 
had 
preferred 
CRR 
No.1357/2020 and CRAN No.1/2020 which is 
likely to be taken up on 23.09.2020, as such the 
matter be adjourned for two more weeks. 
Respondent no.2 further filed an application for 
offences under Section 354 and 354B of the IPC 
which required to be added along with existing 
sections. Once again PWs 1 and 3 were present 

SLP(Crl.) No.12292 of 2022  
 
Page 7 of 14 
 
but the counsel for the complainant again 
insisted that they are ready to face the cross-
examination, however, the application under 
section 319 CrPC may be disposed of first.  
9. The Trial Court recorded their stand that they 
would not face cross-examination until the 
application under Section 319 CrPC is decided.  
The counsel for the accused-appellant was ready 
to cross-examine but could not proceed as the 
prosecution 
witnesses 
did 
not 
agree 
and 
continued to insist that the application under 
section 319 CrPC be decided first.   
10. The Trial Court recorded all the facts, the 
contentions and also the conduct of the parties 
during the trial and ultimately proceeded to close 
the evidence of the prosecution. The Trial Court 
further went on to decide the application under 
section 319 CrPC and held that the evidence 
recorded so far was not admissible as the 
witnesses had failed to present themselves for 
cross-examination 
as 
such 
there 
was 
no 
justification for summoning the parents of the 
accused-appellant on the basis of inadmissible 
evidence.  Accordingly, the same was rejected. 

SLP(Crl.) No.12292 of 2022  
 
Page 8 of 14 
 
The Trial Court further proceeded to hold that it 
was a case of no evidence under Section 232 
CrPC and thereby acquitted the accused-
appellant. 
11. Aggrieved 
by 
the 
same, 
respondent 
no.2 
preferred an appeal before the High Court which 
has since been allowed by the impugned 
judgment and order, giving rise to the present 
appeal.  
12. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant 
and for the respondent no.1 -State of West 
Bengal.  Despite service of notice, no one has put 
in appearance on behalf of respondent no.2-
Complainant.  
13. The High Court in paragraph 15 of the impugned 
judgment relied upon a paragraph of the 
Constitution Bench judgment in the case of 
Hardeep Singh vs. State of Punjab & Ors.4  
wherein it was held that “….power under section 
319 CrPC can be exercised at the stage of 
completion of examination-in-chief and the court 
does not need to wait till the said evidence is 
 
4 (2014) 3 SCC 92 

SLP(Crl.) No.12292 of 2022  
 
Page 9 of 14 
 
tested in cross-examination, for it is the 
satisfaction of the court, which can be gathered 
from the reasons recorded by the court, in 
respect of complicity of some other person(s) not 
facing the trial in the offence.”  
The said view of the Constitution Bench has been 
taken as a mandate by the High Court that 
application under section 319 CrPC must be 
necessarily decided even if the cross-examination 
has not been conducted, only on the basis of 
Examination-in-Chief.  Relying upon the same, 
the High Court has set aside the order of the 
acquittal passed by the Trial Court and has 
remanded the matter to the Trial Court with the 
direction to first decide the application under 
section 319 CrPC and thereafter proceed with the 
sessions trial expeditiously. 
14. The judgment in the case of Hardeep Singh 
(supra) does not provide that it is mandatory to 
decide the application under section 319 CrPC 
before conducting cross-examination and only on 
the basis of examination-in-chief. It merely 
clarifies that even examination-in-chief is part of 

SLP(Crl.) No.12292 of 2022  
 
Page 10 of 14 
 
evidence and record and thus can be relied upon 
to decide an application under section 319 CrPC. 
15. The judgment does not take away the discretion 
of the Trial Court to wait for the cross-
examination to take place before deciding the 
application under section 319 CrPC. It merely 
provides 
that 
consideration 
of 
such 
an 
application should not be a mini trial. It is for the 
Trial Court to decide whether the application 
should be decided without waiting for the cross-
examination to take place or to wait for it.  The 
same would depend upon the satisfaction of the 
Trial Court on the basis of the material placed on 
record. 
16. The five-Judges Bench in Hardeep Singh (supra) 
concluded the following: 
“89. 
We have given our thoughtful consideration 
to 
the 
diverse 
views 
expressed 
in 
the 
aforementioned cases. Once examination-in 
chief is conducted, the statement becomes part 
of the record. It is evidence as per law and in 
the true sense, for at best, it may be rebuttable. 
An evidence being rebutted or controverted 
becomes a matter of consideration, relevance 
and belief, which is the stage of 5 Page 56 
judgment by the court. Yet it is evidence and it 
is material on the basis whereof the court can 
come to a prima facie opinion as to complicity 

SLP(Crl.) No.12292 of 2022  
 
Page 11 of 14 
 
of some other person who may be connected 
with the offence.  
90. As held in Mohd. Shafi (Supra) and Harbhajan 
Singh (Supra), all that is required for the 
exercise of the power under Section 319 Cr.P.C. 
is that, it must appear to the court that some 
other person also who is not facing the trial, 
may also have been involved in the offence. The 
pre-requisite for the exercise of this power is 
similar to the prima facie view which the 
magistrate must come to in order to take 
cognizance of the offence. Therefore, no 
straight-jacket formula can and should be laid 
with respect to conditions precedent for 
arriving at such an opinion and, if the 
Magistrate/Court is convinced even on the 
basis of evidence appearing in Examination-in-
Chief, it can exercise the power under Section 
319 Cr.P.C. and can proceed against such 
other person(s). It is essential to note that the 
Section also uses the words ‘such person could 
be tried’ instead of should be tried. Hence, what 
is required is not to have a mini-trial at this 
stage by having examination and cross-
examination 
and 
thereafter 
rendering 
a 
decision on the overt act of such person sought 
to be added. In fact, it is this mini-trial that 
would affect the right of the person sought to 
be arraigned as an accused rather than not 
having any cross-examination at all, for in light 
of sub-section 4 of Section 319 Cr.P.C., the 
person would be entitled to a fresh trial where 
he would have all the rights including the right 
to cross examine prosecution witnesses and 
examine defence witnesses and advance his 
arguments upon the same. Therefore, even on 
the basis of Examination-in-Chief, the Court or 
the Magistrate can proceed against a person as 

SLP(Crl.) No.12292 of 2022  
 
Page 12 of 14 
 
long as the court is satisfied that the evidence 
appearing against such person is such that it 
prima facie necessitates bringing such person 
to face trial. In fact, Examination-in-Chief 
untested by Cross Examination, undoubtedly 
in itself, is an evidence.” 
 
 
17. Therefore, the complicity of any person sought to 
be arrayed as an accused can be decided with or 
without conducting cross-examination of the 
complainant and other prosecution witnesses, 
and there is no mandate to decide the application 
under 
section 
319 
CrPC 
before 
cross-
examination of other witnesses.  
 
18. In the present case, we find that the Trial Court 
having tried its best to ensure that the 
prosecution witnesses nos.1, 2  and 3 present 
themselves for cross-examination and thereafter 
it would decide the application under section 319 
CrPC, the prosecution witnesses repeatedly 
continued to either absent themselves or file 
adjournment applications and only insisted for 
deciding the application under section 319 CrPC  
first and only thereafter the trial could proceed. 
The complainant has no such mandatory right to 

SLP(Crl.) No.12292 of 2022  
 
Page 13 of 14 
 
insist that an application be decided in such a 
manner.  Even the Public Prosecutor had not 
supported the complainant’s counsel in filing of 
the application under section 319 CrPC. The role 
of the complainant in a trial does not permit it to 
act as a Public Prosecutor on behalf of the State. 
The complainant and its counsel have a limited 
role in a sessions trial in a State case.  The High 
Court failed to take into consideration all these 
aspects.  Why the prosecution witnesses were 
shying from facing the cross-examination is not 
understood.  Their only insistence was that the 
parents of the accused should be summoned and 
dragged into the trial and to somehow or the 
other keep the trial pending.   
19. In view of the facts and circumstances of the 
case, we are of the view that the Trial Court was 
correct in proceeding under section 232 CrPC 
and 
accordingly 
acquitting 
the 
appellant-
accused, treating it to be a case of no evidence. 
The Trial court was also correct in rejecting the 
application under section 319 CrPC for want of 
admissible evidence on part of the prosecution.  

SLP(Crl.) No.12292 of 2022

20. For all the reasons recorded above, the appeal is 
allowed, the impugned order of the High Court is 
set aside and that of the Trial Court is restored.
