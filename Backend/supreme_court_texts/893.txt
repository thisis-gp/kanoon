judgment passed by the First Appellate Court in A.S. 
No.69/2010 dated 30.11.2011 was partly sustained, the 
appellants-plaintiffs have preferred this appeal. 
 
3. 
It is stated that in 2004, by virtue of Sale Deed 
No.3363/2004, the original plaintiffs, who were husband and 
wife, got title and possession over the suit property being  Sy. No. 
258/3 (Re. Sy. O. 293/14) and the shops AP x 460, 461 etc in 
Athiyanoor village, Kamukincode P.O Kodangavila, District 
Trivandrum in State of Kerala, and have been in absolute 
possession since then.  
 
4.  
The suit property is bounded by specific boundaries on all 
four sides of and, pertinently, the defendants’ property is 
immediately to the north of the suit property. 
 
5. 
The present controversy finds its origins in the defendants’ 
act to cut and remove six jack fruit trees on 02.05.2007 on the 
western side of the suit property with the object of, according to 
the plaintiffs, creating a new pathway through the suit property. 
Per contra, according to the defendants, this was done only to 
widen an existing pathway. It was submitted that again on 

                                                                                                                   Page 3 of 10 
 
20.05.2007, the defendants, to the same end, attempted to cut 
and remove the coconut trees standing on suit property.  
 
6. 
Aggrieved by this overt act of the Respondents, the 
Appellants filed the suit bearing O.S. No. 389 of 2007 on the file 
of the Addl. Munsiff Court-1, Neyyattinkara(“Trial Court”) 
seeking permanent prohibitory injunction restraining the 
defendants from trespassing into the suit property and from 
constructing a pathway through the suit property by cutting and 
removing the trees standing  therein or from committing any acts 
of waste in the suit property etc. Furthermore, the plaintiff 
sought damages amounting to Rs. 10,000/- i.e. and for putting 
up a boundary wall on the Northern boundary of suit property, 
etc. 
 
7.  
The Trial Court appointed an Advocate Commissioner to 
submit a report on the status and description of the suit 
property. 
On 
27.07.2009, 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Advocate 
Commissioner and Survey Plan was submitted. Therein, it was 
reported that there indeed is a way through the western side of 

                                                                                                                   Page 4 of 10 
 
the suit property towards defendant's property and there is no 
alternate way available to the defendants than the aforesaid way. 
 
8. 
Considering the pleadings, issues framed and evidence 
presented before it, the Trial Court on 07.12.2009 decreed the 
suit and restrained the defendants from trespassing into the suit 
property and from constructing a pathway through it by cutting 
and removing the coconut trees standing therein and from 
committing any act of waste therein and from interfering with 
the plaintiffs peaceful possession and enjoyment of the suit 
property while also allowing the plaintiffs to put up a compound 
wall along with existing Northern boundary on the ‘GY line’ as 
was placed before it in the Survey Plan. Though the Trial Court 
made a reference to a way through the western side of the suit 
property towards the land of the defendants, it decreed the suit 
on the ground that the defendants had not claimed any special 
right over the pathway. The trial qua Defendant No. 2 was ex-
parte, as were the proceedings before the First Appellate Court 
which are discussed hereunder. 
  

                                                                                                                   Page 5 of 10 
 
9. 
Aggrieved by this decision of the Trial Court, the defendants 
challenged the decree in first appeal bearing number A.S. No. 
69/2010 before the Sub-Court, Neyyattinkara (“First Appellate 
Court”). Notably, before the First Appellate Court, the defendants 
filed I.A. No. 2375 of 2010 for amending the written statement 
under Order VI Rule 17 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”). 
It was contended before us that by way of this amendment 
application, the defendants intended to incorporate a new claim 
of prescriptive right of easement over the way in existence 
reported by the Advocate Commissioner. 
  
10. An objection raised by plaintiffs against I.A. No. 2375 of 
2010 was ultimately rejected by the First Appellate Court and 
the amendment application was allowed on 30.11.2011. On the 
very same day i.e. 30.11.2011, the First Appellate Court allowed 
the appeal and, consequently, reversed the decree. It is the case 
of the Appellants herein that the First Appellate Court erred in 
dismissing the suit without there being any evidence on the basis 
of the new averments raised in the amendment application. 
 

                                                                                                                   Page 6 of 10 
 
11.  Soon thereafter, aggrieved by the decision of the First 
Appellate Court, the plaintiffs preferred regular second appeal in 
RSA No.1432 of 2011 in the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam. 
During the pendency of the regular second appeal, due to the 
passing away of second plaintiff i.e. the wife, the daughter of 
plaintiffs was substituted as a party on 03.07.2018. Vide 
Impugned judgment dated October 1st, 2019, the High Court 
partly allowed the appeal by allowing the construction of 
boundary wall along the northern end of the suit property. 
However, the High Court found no reason to interfere with the 
finding of the First Appellate Court on the prescriptive 
easementary right over the way towards the property of the 
defendants. 
  
12. As noted above, the Trial Court decreed the suit filed by the 
plaintiffs herein. Being aggrieved, the respondents-defendants 
preferred A.S. No.69/2010 before the Court of the Sub-Judge, 
Neyyattinkara (First Appellate Court). During the pendency of 
the said appeal, an application was filed under Order VI Rule 17 
of the CPC seeking amendment of the Written Statement.  On 
30.11.2011, the said application was allowed and the first 

                                                                                                                   Page 7 of 10 
 
defendant was permitted to amend the Written Statement. 
Interestingly, on the very same day i.e. on 30.11.2011, on the 
basis of what was averred in the amended Written Statement, 
the appeal, being A.S. No.69/2010 was allowed and the 
judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court dated 
07.12.2009 in O.S. No.389/2007 was set aside. It is against the 
said judgment of the First Appellate Court that the appellants 
herein preferred R.S.A. No.1432/2011 which has been allowed 
in part.  Hence, this appeal. 
 
13. We have heard learned senior counsel for the appellants 
and learned counsel for the respondents and perused the 
material on record. 
 
14. Although several arguments were advanced at the bar, we 
have considered only one argument made by the learned senior 
counsel for the appellants being the permission granted by the 
First Appellate Court to seek amendment of the Written 
Statement in A.S. No.69/2010. On such Written Statement 
being permitted to be amended there was no further 
consideration of the matter inasmuch as the impact of the 

                                                                                                                   Page 8 of 10 
 
amendment of the Written Statement on the merits of the case 
was not considered. This is so as on the very day the amendment 
of the written statement was allowed the First Appellate Court 
also disposed of the appeal by setting aside the judgment and 
decree of the Trial Court. There was no reasoning given as to 
why in the absence of any further evidence being recorded by 
the First Appellate Court on the basis of the amended Written 
Statement, the judgment and decree of the Trial Court could be 
set aside. We find that an opportunity had to be given to both 
sides to let in evidence on the amended Written Statement as, 
in sum and substance, the first defendant by the said 
amendment had in a way sought a counter claim by averring 
that the first defendant had the right to the pathway by way of 
a easementary right and had been using it so for over fifty years. 
It may be that there is a reference to a pathway in the judgment 
and decree of the Trial Court but the fact remains that there was 
a decree granted by the Trial Court which could not have been 
set aside merely because there was an amendment to the 
Written Statement made by the first defendant and in the 
absence of any evidence being let in support of the claim made 

                                                                                                                   Page 9 of 10 
 
by the respondent herein on the basis of the Written Statement 
being amended.  
 
15.  In our view, the amendment to the Written Statement 
called for recoding of evidence particularly on behalf of the first 
defendant herein in order to prove his claim and contra evidence, 
if any, on behalf of the appellants-plaintiffs herein. 
   
16.  We find that any averment made in a plaint or Written 
Statement must be supported by evidence. In the absence of 
there being any evidence, the First Appellate Court could not 
have implied that there was already evidence in regard to what 
has been stated in the Written Statement without recording any 
evidence in support of the amended pleading.   
  
17. In the circumstances, we set aside the impugned judgment 
and decree of the High Court passed in R.S.A. No.1432/2011 as 
well as the judgment and decree dated 30.11.2011 in 
A.S.No.69/2010; the matter is remanded to the First Appellate 
Court to reconsider A.S. No.69/2010 in view of the amendment 
made to the Written Statement and to pass an order as to 
whether a further recording of evidence is required on the basis 

                                                                                                                   Page 10 of 10 
 
of the said amendment and to proceed to dispose the appeal in 
accordance with law.   
 
The appeal is allowed and disposed of in the aforesaid 
terms. No costs.
