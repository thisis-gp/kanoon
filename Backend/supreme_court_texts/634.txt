34 IPC and in alternate under Section 302 read with 
Section 34, and 201 of Indian Penal Code. By the 
same order, the High Court also quashed the order 
passed on 13.11.2019 against Respondent No. 3 to 5, 
framing charges under section 498-A, 306 read with 
Section 34 and in alternate under Section 302 read 
with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. The Appellant 
Ranjit Mittal is the son of Complainant- Mr. Kailash 
Mittal who passed away on 21.02.2023. The 
Complainant was father of Anjali Agarwal, the 
deceased.  
 
3. The brief facts leading to framing of charges against 
Respondent No.2 to 5 are as follows: 
 
4. Deceased Anjali Agarwal was married to Respondent 
No.2 Sulabh Agarwal on 06.05.2006. After three 
years of marriage, daughter Mohi was born to them. 
In 2015, they had a son named Anshaj. She was 
living in her matrimonial home at Arihant Vihar 
Colony in Vidisha with her mother-in-law- Madhu 
Agarwal and father-in-law- Kailash Babu Agarwal 
who are Respondent No. 3 and 4 respectively. 

3 
 
Respondent No. 5, Shilpi Agarwal is sister-in-law of 
the deceased and she is married.  
 
5. On 10.03.2018, a Merg intimation was registered at 
Police Station- Kotwali, District- Vidisha (M.P.) based 
on information by a ward boy working in District 
Hospital Vidisha that deceased Anjali Agarwal was 
brought dead to Hospital. She was brought by 
husband of the deceased Anjali Agrawal. It was 
reported that she had fallen from the terrace of her 
house. Thereafter, Merg No .16/2018 under Section 
174 of Cr.P.C. was recorded. Dead-body panchnama 
was prepared and dead body was sent for 
postmortem. As per the postmortem report dated 
10.03.2018, the cause of death was hemorrhage and 
mode of death was shock.   
 
6. It is to be noted that on 10.03.2018, around 10.30 in 
morning the neighbor of the deceased- Sandeep 
Sunhare saw her lying on her stomach at a backdoor 
of another house. He informed her husband Sulabh 
Agarwal and all people assembled. Respondent took 
her to Chetan hospital by placing her on handcart. 
Another neighbor of the deceased, Mona Singh has 

4 
 
stated that Anjali was not wearing anything on her 
hands and feet.  
 
7. On 17.05.2018, First Information Report (FIR No. 
0381/2018) was registered against Respondent No. 2 
Sulabh Agarwal under section 498-A and 306 of IPC. 
Further Section 201 and 34 of IPC were added 
against Respondent No. 2 to 5. Respondent No.2 to 5 
were arrested on 22.07.2018 and 08.07.2019.  
 
8. After the investigation, charge-sheet bearing no. 
292/19 was filed under section 498 A, 306, 201 and 
34 of IPC against the Respondent No. 2 to 5 on 
27.09.2019. In the charge sheet, 27 witnesses were 
cited for examination. The case was committed for 
trial as ST No. 55/2019 before the 3rd Additional 
Session Judge, District Vidisha. 
 
9. Thereafter, Charges were framed by the 3rd Additional 
Session 
Judge, 
District- 
Vidisha 
against 
the 
Respondent No. 2 under section 498 A, 306 read with 
Section 34 of IPC and in alternate section 302 read 
with section 34 and 201 of IPC by order dated 
07.11.2019. Against the Respondent No. 3 to 5 

5 
 
Charges were framed under section 498-A, 306 read 
with section 34 of IPC and in alternate under section 
302 read with section 34 and 201 of IPC by order 
dated 13.11.2019.  
 
10. 
Aggrieved 
by 
these 
orders, 
the 
accused 
Respondents filed Criminal Revisions under section 
397 read with section 401 of CrPC, before the High 
Court of Judicature at Madhya Pradesh. The High 
Court by the Impugned order, set aside the order of 
trial court, thereby quashing the charges against 
Respondent No.2 to 5, holding that prima facie there 
is no material to show that Respondent accused 
persons in any manner abetted the deceased to 
commit suicide and only omnibus allegations have 
been levelled against them. The High Court also 
concluded that, at the most, there may be a family 
dispute, but that does not mean that Respondents 
have instigated the deceased to commit suicide and 
there is no evidence of abetment soon before her 
death. No ingredients for commission of offence 
under Section 306 or 302 of IPC are made out and 
matter simply appears to be of family dispute. Thus, 

6 
 
it 
quashed 
the 
criminal 
proceedings 
against 
Respondent no. 2 to 5.   
 
11. 
The Appellant has filed the present appeals 
against the order(s) of High Court. At this stage, it is 
important to consider the Statements recorded in the 
Merg report under Section 174 of Criminal Procedure 
Code.  
 
12. 
As per the statement of Alok Kumar Agrawal, he 
knew the deceased for 15 years as she was daughter 
of his aunt’s sister-in-law. He is working as 
Supervisor in private company at Pithampur in 
District Dhar. The deceased contacted him two and 
half months before the incidence and they used to 
talk on phone calls. On the day of incidence, around 
10 AM, he received a call from unknown number. The 
husband of deceased Sulabh Agarwal was talking on 
the other side. He spoke angrily and abused him. 
After 5-7 minutes Alok Agrawal received another call 
from Anjali where she was crying and asking him to 
come to Vidisha. Her husband snatched the phone 
and again started abusing him. He said that if you 
are not coming to Vidisha then I will come there. He 

7 
 
further said, “now she (Anjali) will go to the hospital 
and then tell me when will you come. I am giving you 
time of 12 o’clock.” Later around 1.30 PM, Alok got to 
know about Anjali’s death. In his statement he 
mentions that Anjali was a sensible girl and she 
cannot commit suicide.  
 
13. 
The father of the deceased, Kailash Narayan has 
stated that he received a call from Anjali’s in-laws 
that she has fallen from terrace and she is serious. 
When he reached her house, he found her dead body 
after postmortem. He states that they were not told 
how she fell and he suspects that her in-laws have 
killed her. After a month of marriage, the deceased 
had started complaining to him that her in-laws were 
not satisfied with the dowry they received and were 
constantly demanding more dowry. After the 
deceased had daughter, her mother-in-law and 
sister-in-law were angry and they started beating and 
abusing here. Even after birth of the son in 2015, 
they were torturing the deceased and not allowing her 
to visit parental home.  
 

8 
 
14. 
It has been further revealed from the statement 
of Rajesh Jain, who used to work at house of 
deceased, that the deceased was not treated well by 
her in laws as she would often get scolded by them. 
Additionally, Respondent No. 5 sister-in-law of Anjali, 
disliked her. She would argue with the deceased 
whenever she came to the house.  
 
15. 
The Appellant is brother of deceased. He 
submits that the phone call with Alok Kumar one 
hour before the incidence shows foul play. Further, 
carrying the deceased in handcart (‘Thela’) despite 
having neighbors spot ready with their vehicles, 
creates a doubt that the husband himself did not 
want to save his wife’s life. There is a possibility of 
him with help of other accused persons, had pushed 
the deceased from terrace. Further, the fact that 
deceased was not wearing any jewelry at that time, 
creates a doubt on conduct of accused.  
 
16. 
On the other hand, the Respondent No. 2 to 5 
submit that FIR has been registered against them 
only due to pressure of electronic and print media. 
Respondent No. 2 carried the deceased in handcart 

9 
 
only because the hospital was close to his house and 
it would have taken time for a car to get out. Mere 
harassment does not amount to abetment to suicide. 
Thus, there is no prima facie offence made out 
against the Respondents as there is no overt act 
indicating active involvement to instigate the 
deceased to commit suicide. Further, there were no 
ante mortem injuries and her injuries have come 
from falling from terrace. The same has been 
confirmed by the Medical officers.  
 
17. 
We have considered the submissions of both the 
counsels and have perused through the record.  
 
18. 
From the above facts and testimonies of 
witnesses, it is evident that deceased struggled in her 
matrimonial home and relations between her and her 
in-laws cannot be called healthy. The above 
testimonies indicate that she was being abused and 
ill-treated in the house. Additionally, the testimony of 
Alok Agarwal indicates that there was a serious 
argument between her and her husband right before 
she allegedly fell off from terrace. She was taken to 
hospital by husband on handcart despite having 

10 
 
alternate options of using the Car. No ornaments 
were found on her body.  
 
19. 
For quashing of criminal charges it must be 
shown that there is no sufficient evidence to prove a 
prima facie case against the accused person/s. 
However, in present case, considering the statements 
by witnesses indicating abuse and torture of 
deceased 
by 
her 
in-laws 
and 
other 
factual 
circumstances, prima facie case is made against the 
accused persons. Thus, it would be travesty of justice 
to put a complete stop on criminal proceedings. 
Further, the trial shall give adequate opportunity to 
the accused respondents to defend themselves.  
 
20. 
This court in CBI v. Aryan Singh1 has held 
that,  
“10. As per the cardinal principle of law, 
at the stage of discharge and/or 
quashing of the criminal proceedings, 
while exercising the powers under 
Section 482 Cr. P.C., the Court is not 
required to conduct the mini trial. 
 
At the stage of discharge and/or while 
exercising the powers under Section 
 
1 2023 SCC OnLine SC 379.  

11 
 
482 Cr. P.C., the Court has a very 
limited jurisdiction and is required to 
consider 
“whether 
any 
sufficient 
material is available to proceed further 
against the accused for which the 
accused is required to be tried or not”. 
 
21. 
Thus, at this stage, we do not deem it necessary 
to delve into the discussion of whether there is 
sufficient evidence to fulfil the requirements of 
particular sections of Indian Penal Code charged 
against the Respondents. The trial court shall decide 
whether charges are proved or not in due course. 
Given the statements of witnesses, suspicious 
circumstances around death of deceased and gravity 
of offense, we are of the opinion that the trial needs 
to be conducted to reach to the truth. Criminal 
proceedings against accused Respondent No. 2 to 5 
shall be thus continued.  
 
22. 
The High Court erred in quashing the order of 
trial court framing charges. Accordingly, the Criminal 
Appeals are allowed and the orders passed by High 
Court for Judicature of Madhya Pradesh at Gwalior 
in Criminal Revision No.5766 of 2019, Criminal 
Revision No. 5767 of 2019 and Criminal Revision 

12 
 
5768 of 2019 are set aside. The trial will proceed as 
per law from the stage of framing of charges. It is 
however, made clear that any other observations 
made in this order shall not influence the Trial Court 
which shall proceed with the trial and decide the 
same on the basis of evidence led before it. 
 
23. 
Criminal Appeals Nos. 003680 – 003682 of 2024 
stand allowed as above.
