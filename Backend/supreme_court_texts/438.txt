challenging the Order passed by the High Court of Karnataka 
on 21st March 2022 in Writ Petition No. 10975 of 2020

set aside the Order dated 07th March 2020 passed by the Trial 
Court in Com. OS No. 1026 of 2018 and further directed the 
Trial Court to accept the memo dated 14th November 2019

2. 
The brief facts, necessary for disposal of this Civil Appeal 
are that the respondents/plaintiffs preferred a suit under Order 
XXXVII of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (henceforth ‘CPC’) 
against 
the 
appellants/defendants 
for 
recovery 
of 
Rs. 
1,04,16,576/- with interest. The appellants/defendants entered 
appearance and filed application seeking leave to defend which 
was allowed by the Trial Court on 19th June 2019 with a 
direction to the appellants/defendants to deposit 50% of the 
suit claim. The said order was challenged before the High Court 
in Writ Petition No. 28349 of 2019 which was dismissed on 08th 
August 2019 against which an SLP (C) No. 20626 of 2019 was 
preferred by the appellants/defendants which came to be 
dismissed on 06th September 2019, by passing the following 
order:-  
“We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned 
order passed by the High Court.  
The special leave petition, is accordingly, dismissed.  
However, it is open for the petitioners to approach the 
High Court within four weeks from today for variation of 
the order satisfying the High Court that he can provide 
adequate security in terms of the orders of the High 
Court.”

3. 
Despite the above order passed by this Court, the 
appellants/defendants did not approach the High Court for 
variation of the order as permitted by this Court.  
 
4. 
When the matter stood thus, the respondent/plaintiff filed 
memo dated 14th November 2019, requesting the Trial Court to 
decree the suit in terms of Order XXXVII Rule 3(6)(b) of the 
CPC. The Trial Court after considering the material on record, 
including the objections by the appellant/defendant rejected 
the memo vide order dated 07th March 2020. This order was 
assailed by the respondent/plaintiff before the High Court which 
has been allowed under the impugned order simultaneously 
directing the Trial Court to accept the memo and pass 
appropriate orders accordingly.  
 
5. 
The appellants/defendants have argued that in view of 
Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 
(henceforth ‘IBC’), the moratorium has become operational, 
therefore, the suit cannot proceed. This argument was not 
accepted by the High Court and under the impugned order, the 
Trial Court was directed to accept the memo and pass 

4 
 
appropriate orders. It is important to notice that this Court has 
passed an order on 01st December 2023 staying the impugned 
order, however, much prior to the interim order of this Court, 
the suit itself was decided finally by passing a decree on 20th 
April 2023.  It is not brought to our notice that the said decree 
has been challenged any further by the defendants.  Thus, for 
the present, the suit is not pending, therefore, the present 
appeal which arises out of an interim order passed by the Trial 
Court during pendency of the suit, has been rendered 
infructuous.   
6. 
The Civil Appeal is, accordingly, dismissed as infructuous.
