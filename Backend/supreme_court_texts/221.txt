order dated 28.04.2005 passed by the Commissioner of 
Customs 
and 
Central 
Excise, 
Indore 
(for 
short 
‘the 
Commissioner’ hereinafter).  
2.1  
By the aforesaid order dated 28.04.2005, the 
Commissioner 
had 
confirmed 
the 
duty 
demand 
of 
Rs.3,99,255.00 in respect of 27 cases not found in the 
warehouse and imposed penalty of Rs.1 lakh on the appellant 
under Section 112 of the Customs Act. That apart, the appellant 
was directed to pay interest on the duty confirmed in terms of 
Section 28AB of the Customs Act from the date of enforcement 
of the said section till the date of actual payment of duty. The 
Commissioner had also confiscated 264 cases of imported goods 
valued at Rs.48,79,776.00 seized from within the factory 
premises of the appellant but outside the approved warehouse 
under Section 111 of the Customs Act. However, the confiscated 
goods were permitted to be redeemed on payment of fine of Rs. 
2 lakhs. Thirty days’ time was granted to the appellant to 
exercise the option for redeeming the goods. Further, the 
Commissioner had confirmed customs duty amounting to 
Rs.39,03,821.00 in terms of Section 71 read with the proviso to 
Section 28A of the Customs Act. The appellant was also 

3 
 
 
 
required to pay interest amounting to Rs.18,88,425.00 on the 
customs duty confirmed on the 264 packages from the date of 
warehousing till the date of detection of the shortage in the 
warehouse; in addition, appellant was also required to pay 
interest on the duty confirmed in terms of Section 28AB of the 
Customs Act from the date of enforcement of the said section 
till the date of actual payment of duty confirmed on the 264 
cases. 
3. 
 
Appellant before us is M/s Bhanu Iron and Steel 
Company Limited, Plot No. 801, Sector III, Industrial Estate, 
Pithampur, District Dhar in the State of Madhya Pradesh 
(‘BISCO’ for short). 
4. 
 
This appeal has a chequered history. Before finally 
landing in this Court, the appellant had gone through several 
rounds of appeal and remand. For a proper perspective, it would 
be apposite to briefly narrate the factual trajectory of the case. 
5. 
 
Appellant had imported second hand steel mill 
machinery and parts thereof under Project Import Facility 
covered by Chapter Heading No.98.01 of the Schedule to the 
Customs Tariff Act, 1975. 

4 
 
 
 
6. 
 
A 
warehouse 
within 
the 
precincts 
of 
the 
industrial/factory premises of the appellant was notified as a 
public bonded warehouse on management basis with M/s 
Central Warehousing Corporation as warehouse keeper by the 
then Collector of Customs and Central Excise, Indore vide the 
notification dated 03.05.1989 for storage of the imported second 
hand steel mill machinery and parts thereof without payment 
of customs duty. According to the respondent, the appellant had 
imported in all 595 cases of machinery parts which were 
required to be warehoused in the notified public bonded 
warehouse. The breakup of the 595 cases of the machinery 
parts as provided by the respondent is as under: 
Sl.

7. 
 
Acting on the basis of information received that the 
appellant had misused the warehousing facility, officials of the 

5 
 
 
 
respondent had searched the industrial premises of the 
appellant including the notified public bonded warehouse on 
07.08.1992. In the course of the search, the stock lying within 
the notified public bonded warehouse were verified. On such 
verification, only 304 cases were found lying inside the 
warehouse; 264 cases were found outside the warehouse but 
within the industrial/factory premises of the appellant; 
remaining 27 cases were not found either inside the warehouse 
or outside the warehouse within the industrial/factory 
premises. 
8. 
 
As no documents showing clearance of the goods 
contained in the 264 cases from within the warehouse but lying 
outside the warehouse on payment of duty and interest as 
required under Section 71 of the Customs Act could be 
produced, the said goods were seized in terms of Section 110 of 
the Customs Act. The value of the goods seized was estimated 
at Rs.48,79,776.00. 
9. 
 
In his statement recorded under Section 108 of the 
Customs Act on 07.08.1992, Sh. Yashwant Singh Bisht, Project 
Officer (Commercial) of the appellant stated that the 264 cases 

6 
 
 
 
of imported goods were kept outside the bond under a shed as 
the trailers transporting the goods could not enter the notified 
warehouse in view of the soil becoming very sluggish on account 
of heavy rains and also because of paucity of space. The 
Collector, therefore, opined that the appellant had removed the 
264 cases of warehoused goods valued at Rs.48,79,776.00 
attracting 
duty 
of 
Rs.39,03,821.00 
and 
interest 
of 
Rs.18,88,425.00 in violation of Section 71 read with Section 
111(j) of the Customs Act. The seized goods were thus held 
liable for confiscation. 
10.  
It 
was 
further 
alleged 
that 
appellant 
had 
unauthorisedly cleared 27 cases of the imported goods valued 
at Rs.4,99,068.00 attracting duty of Rs.3,99,255.00 with 
interest of Rs.2,41,326.00 which were liable to be recovered 
under Section 71 read with the proviso to Section 28(1) of the 
Customs Act. 
11.  
That apart, it was alleged that M/s. Central 
Warehousing Corporation, Pithampur had abetted the appellant 
in clearing the warehoused goods without payment of duty and 
interest. 

7 
 
 
 
12.  
In the above circumstances, a show cause notice 
dated 22.01.1993 was issued to the appellant as well as to the 
warehouse keeper by the Collector (now the Commissioner) to 
explain and show cause as to why: 
(i)  the seized quantity of 264 cases of goods 
valued at Rs.48,79,776.00 and attracting duty 
of Rs.39,03,821.00 plus Rs.18,88,425.00 due to 
interest should not be confiscated in terms of 
Section 71 read with Section 111(j) of the 
Customs Act.  
(ii) the amount of duty of Rs.3,99,255.00 plus 
interest of Rs.2,41,326.00 payable on 27 cases 
of goods valued at Rs.4,99,068.00 cleared and 
utilized by the appellant, should not be 
demanded from the appellant in terms of Section 
71 read with the proviso to Section 28 (1) of the 
Customs Act.  
(iii)   a penalty under Section 112 of the Customs 
Act should not be imposed for violation of 
Section 71 and Section 111(j) of the Customs 
Act.  
13.  
Appellant submitted reply dated 02.04.1994. In its 
reply, appellant stated that there was heavy rain in the month 
of August 1989 and the soil outside the notified warehouse had 

8 
 
 
 
become very sluggish. As a result, the trailers carrying the 
consignment could not enter the notified warehouse. The goods 
were downloaded in the open outside the notified warehouse 
but within the factory premises. To prevent the goods from 
getting damaged, appellant had requested the concerned 
Superintendent of Customs and Central Excise to shift the 
machineries to under a shed within the factory premises under 
Section 64 of the Customs Act. Permission was granted by the 
Superintendent. 
In 
terms 
of 
such 
permission 
of 
the 
Superintendent, who was the proper officer, appellant had 
shifted the goods to under the shed to prevent further damage 
of the goods. It was contended that the goods were still under 
the bonded warehouse and could not be said to have been 
cleared. In this connection, reference to and reliance was placed 
on Section 15 of the Customs Act. This position was clarified by 
Sh. Yashwant Singh Bisht in his statement recorded on 
07.08.1992. The appellant, therefore, requested the authority to 
drop the proceedings. 
14.  
It may be mentioned that the Central Warehousing 
Corporation (for short ‘the Corporation’ hereinafter) had also 
submitted its reply dated 19.12.1993. In the reply it was stated 

9 
 
 
 
that an open area of 2,000 sq. meters in the premises of the 
appellant having fencing and a gate with locking arrangement 
was approved by the customs and central excise authorities as 
a public bonded warehouse. Appellant vide letter dated 
30.08.1989 sought permission from the Superintendent, 
Customs and Central Excise, Range-III, Pithampur for 
unloading the cargo covered by Bond No.T-1592 dated 
31.05.1989 outside the said warehouse on account of heavy 
rains, etc. It was pointed out that the trailers carrying the 
consignment could not enter the said warehouse because those 
got stuck in the soil outside the said warehouse as the soil had 
got sluggish due to heavy rains. The Superintendent gave 
permission for unloading the cargo outside the warehouse but 
within the factory premises on the body of the letter itself. The 
machinery parts had to be shifted to a shed outside the bonded 
warehouse but within the factory premises to protect those 
parts from further rusting and corrosion.  
15.  
Commissioner by his adjudication order dated 
28.08.1996 did not accept the reply of the appellant and 
confirmed the demand and interest. It was ordered as under: 

10 
 
 
 
(i)  demand for duty of Rs.3,99,255.00 plus 
Rs.2,41,326.00 leviable on 27 cases cleared in 
a clandestine manner was confirmed for 
recovery from the appellant in terms of Section 
71 read with the proviso to Section 28(1) of the 
Customs Act.  
(ii)  264 cases of imported goods valued at 
Rs.48,79,776.00 seized from the premises 
other than the approved warehouse were 
confiscated under Section 111 of the Customs 
Act but permitted to be redeemed on payment 
of fine of Rs.12,00,000.00 (Rs. twelve lakhs 
only). Appellant would also suffer duty of 
Rs.39,03,821.00 plus interest at the time of 
their ultimate clearance.  
(iii) penalty of Rs.5,00,000.00 (Rs. five lakhs 
only) was imposed on the appellant under 
Section 112 of the Customs Act. 
(iv) penalty of Rs.25,000.00 (Rs. twenty five 
thousand only) was imposed on the Central 
Warehousing Corporation under Section 112 of 
the Customs Act.  
16.  
Aggrieved 
by 
the 
aforesaid 
order 
of 
the 
Commissioner, appellant preferred an appeal before the then 
Central Excise and Gold Appellate Tribunal (CEGAT). By order 
dated 18.02.1999, CEGAT disposed of the appeal by setting 

11 
 
 
 
aside the order of the Commissioner and remanding the matter 
back to the Commissioner for fresh adjudication. The 
Commissioner was directed to look into the new facts and 
documents brought on record by the appellant and thereafter 
decide the case de novo in accordance with the principles of 
natural justice. 
17.  
Following the remand, a fresh adjudication order was 
passed by the Commissioner on 31.12.2002. In this order, the 
Commissioner recorded that the warehoused goods were 
removed to a place outside the approved warehouse without 
following the procedure set out under Sections 67, 68 and 69 of 
the Customs Act. The Commissioner, thereafter, reiterated the 
first adjudication order dated 28.08.1996. 
18.  
Assailing the aforesaid order of the Commissioner 
dated 31.12.2002, appellant preferred appeal before the 
CESTAT. In its order dated 08.10.2003, CESTAT observed that 
the Commissioner had not looked into the additional 
documents which were part of the record. CESTAT, therefore, 
opined that the matter should be remanded back to the 
adjudicating authority for fresh adjudication after taking into 

12 
 
 
 
consideration the documents produced by the appellant, 
including those produced before the CESTAT. Thus, by the 
order dated 08.10.2003, CESTAT allowed the appeal of the 
appellant by remanding the matter back to the Commissioner 
for re-adjudication after affording an opportunity of hearing to 
the appellant. 
19.  
The matter was taken up by the Commissioner afresh 
on remand. By a detailed order dated 28.04.2005, the 
Commissioner directed as under: 
(i) 
demand of Rs.3,99,255.00 leviable on the 
27 cases found not warehoused was confirmed 
for recovery from the appellant in terms of the 
conditions of transit bond.  
(ii) 
appellant should pay interest on the duty 
confirmed in terms of Section 28AB of the 
Customs Act from the date of enforcement of the 
said section till the date of actual payment of 
duty. The interest amount was directed to be 
worked out and communicated to the appellant 
by the Assistant Commissioner, Central Excise 
Division, Pithampur.  
(iii) 264 cases of imported goods valued at 
Rs.48,79,776.00 seized from the premises of the 

13 
 
 
 
appellant outside the approved warehouse were 
confiscated under Section 111 of the Customs 
Act. As the goods were within the factory 
premises but outside the bonded warehouse, a 
lenient view was taken; the goods were 
permitted to be redeemed on payment of fine of 
Rs.2,00,000.00 (Rupees two lakhs only). The 
option for redeeming the goods was to be 
exercised by the appellant within 30 days from 
the date of receipt of the order.  
(iv) 
customs 
duty 
amounting 
to 
Rs.39,03,821.00 for recovery from the appellant 
in terms of Section 71 read with the proviso to 
Section 28A of the Customs Act was confirmed.  
(v) 
appellant was required to pay interest 
amounting to Rs.18,88,425.00 on the customs 
duty confirmed on the 264 packages from the 
date of warehousing till the date of detection of 
the shortage in the warehouse, i.e. from 
04.02.1989 to 07.08.1992, in terms of Section 
71 of the Customs Act.  
(vi) 
appellant was also required to pay interest 
on the duty confirmed in terms of Section 28AB 
of the Customs Act from the date of enforcement 
of the said section to till the date of actual 
payment of duty confirmed on the 264 
packages. The interest amount was directed to 

14 
 
 
 
be worked out and communicated to the 
appellant by the Assistant Commissioner, 
Central Excise Division, Pithampur.  
(vii) penalty of Rs.1,00,000.00 (Rupees one 
lakh only) was imposed on the appellant under 
Section 112 of the Customs Act.  
 
20.  
It was against this order that the related appeal was 
filed by the appellant before the CESTAT. By the impugned 
order dated 30.04.2009, CESTAT dismissed the appeal. 
21.  
Hence the present appeal. This Court by order dated 
21.08.2009 had issued notice. 
22.   
 Respondent has filed counter affidavit. It is stated 
that during the visit of the officials of the Preventive Branch of 
the Commissionerate on 07.08.1992, the impugned goods were 
found outside the notified warehouse. That apart, there was no 
explanation for the imported goods contained in the 27 cases 
which were neither found within the bonded warehouse nor 
outside the bonded warehouse within the factory premises. In 
such circumstances, the respondent has justified the order 
dated 28.04.2005 which was affirmed by the CESTAT vide order 
dated 30.04.2009.  

15 
 
 
 
23.   
It may be mentioned that appellant has brought on 
record two additional documents. Appellant had sought for 
information from the Central Warehousing Corporation under 
the Right to Information Act, 2005 vide letter dated 22.09.2009 
regarding payment of custom establishment charges by the 
Corporation. 
Appellant 
was 
informed 
by 
the 
Central 
Warehousing Corporation vide letter dated 18.12.2009 that the 
Corporation had deposited a sum of Rs.56,10.294.00 under the 
head of ‘Pithampur Warehousing (Bhanu Iron and Steel 
Company Limited along with wind up Warehouse) custom 
establishment charges’ for the financial year 1992-1993 to 
2007-2008. 
24.   
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that 
CESTAT had failed to consider the fact that it was on the basis 
of specific permission granted to the appellant by the proper 
officer that the impugned goods were found outside the 
warehouse but within the industrial/factory premises of the 
appellant. Therefore, in terms Section 64(d) of the Customs Act 
respondent could not have treated the said goods as having 
been removed from the warehouse. He submits that since the 
appellant had not cleared the warehoused goods, Section 64 of 

16 
 
 
 
the Customs Act would come into play. Therefore, CESTAT was 
clearly in error in upholding the order of the respondent 
applying Section 15(1)(b) of the Customs Act for determining the 
rate of duty in respect of those goods. According to him, in the 
facts of the present case the only provision that would be 
applicable is the residuary provision i.e., Section 15 (1) (c) of the 
Customs Act.  
24.1.  
Learned counsel has also placed reliance on the 
circular dated 12.07.1989 of the Central Board of Excise and 
Customs which was fully applicable to the case of the appellant. 
Though this circular was subsequently superseded by circular 
dated 14.08.1997, it would be the former circular which would 
be applicable to the facts of the present case.  
24.2.  
Learned counsel further submits that CESTAT was 
not justified for upholding the order of the respondent applying 
Section 71 of the Customs Act read with Section 28AB of the 
said Act while imposing interest on the confiscated goods. 
Confiscation itself was not justified. 
24.3.  
Finally, it is contended that both the respondent as 
well as CESTAT had overlooked the fact that the goods in 

17 
 
 
 
question were denied to the appellant for a long time. Therefore, 
a lenient view ought to have been taken.  
25.   
Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other 
hand, submits that on the basis of reliable information received 
about suspected misuse of the warehousing facility by the 
appellant, officers of the Preventive Branch of the Collectorate 
of Central Excise and Customs, Indore had searched the 
premises of the appellant on 07.08.1992 and physically verified 
the stock. On verification, it was found that 304 cases were 
stocked inside the warehouse while 264 cases were found 
outside the warehouse but within the factory premises. 
Remaining 27 cases were found neither inside the warehouse 
nor within the factory premises. It was thereafter that action 
was taken under the relevant provisions of the Customs Act 
following which show cause notice was issued to the appellant.  
25.1.  
Learned 
counsel 
has 
justified 
the 
ultimate 
adjudication order as well as the impugned order of the CESTAT 
confirming the said adjudication order.  
25.2.  
In such circumstances, he submits that there is no 
merit in the appeal and, therefore, the same should be 
dismissed. 

18 
 
 
 
26.   
Submissions made have been duly considered.    
27.  
We may now refer to some of the relevant provisions 
of the Customs Act. Section 2(43) defines a ‘warehouse’ to mean 
a public warehouse licensed under Section 57 or a private 
warehouse licensed under Section 58 or a special warehouse 
licensed under Section 58A of the Customs Act. ‘Warehoused 
goods’ has been defined under Section 2(44) to mean goods 
deposited in a warehouse. 
28.  
Section 12 of the Customs Act deals with dutiable 
goods. Sub-Section(1) thereof says that duties of customs shall 
be levied at such rates as may be specified under the Customs 
Tariff Act, 1975 on goods imported into or exported from India. 
29.  
Date for determination of rate of duty and tariff 
valuation of imported goods is dealt with in Section 15. Sub-
Section(1) of Section 15 says that the rate of duty and tariff 
valuation, if any, applicable to any imported goods shall be the 
rate and valuation in force- 
(a) 
in the case of goods entered for home 
consumption under Section 46, on the date on 
which a bill of entry in respect of such goods is 
presented under that section; 

19 
 
 
 
(b) 
in the case of goods cleared from a 
warehouse under Section 68, on the date on 
which the goods are actually removed from the 
warehouse; 
(c) 
in the case of any other goods, on the date 
of payment of duty. 
 
30.  
While Section 28 provides for recovery of duties not 
levied or short levied, Section 28AA deals with interest on 
delayed payment of duty. On the other hand, Section 28AB 
provided for interest on delayed payment of duty in special 
cases. Substance of Section 28AB (since deleted) was that where 
any duty was not levied or paid or short levied etc., the person 
who was liable to pay the duty would also be liable to pay 
interest in addition to duty at such rate not below 10% and not 
exceeding 36% per annum as may be fixed by the central 
government by notification in the official gazette. 
31.  
Chapter IX of the Customs Act comprising of Sections 
57 to 73A deal with warehousing. Section 57 provides for 
licensing of public warehouses where dutiable goods may be 
warehoused.  As per Section 58, as it stood at the relevant time, 
the proper officer may license a private warehouse where 

20 
 
 
 
dutiable goods imported by or on behalf of the licensee or any 
other imported goods in respect of which facilities for deposit in 
a public warehouse are not available, may be deposited. Sub-
Section(2) provides for cancellation of license so granted by 
giving a month’s written notice in advance if the licensee had 
contravened any of the provisions of the Customs Act or 
committed breach of any of the conditions of the license. 
However, before such cancellation, the licensee was required to 
be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard. 
32.  
‘Warehousing bond’ is provided for in Section 59. As 
per sub-Section(1), the importer of any goods specified in 
Section 61(1) which had been entered for warehousing and 
assessed to duty under Sections 17 or 18 shall execute a bond 
binding himself in a sum equal to thrice the amount of the duty 
assessed on such goods. 
33.  
As per Section 60, as it stood at the relevant point of 
time, when the provisions of Section 59 have been complied 
with in respect of any goods, the proper officer may make an 
order permitting the deposit of goods in a warehouse. 

21 
 
 
 
34.  
Section 61 mentions the period for which the goods 
may remain warehoused. Sub-Section (1) says that any 
warehoused goods may be left in the warehouse in which they 
are deposited or in any warehouse to which they may be 
removed- 
(a) in the case of capital goods intended for 
use in any hundred percent export-oriented 
undertaking, till the expiry of five years; 
(aa) in the case of goods other than capital 
goods intended for use in any hundred percent 
export-oriented undertaking, till the expiry of 
three years; and 
(b) in the case of any other goods, till the 
expiry of one year; 
 
 after the date on which the proper officer has made an order 
under Section 60 permitting the deposit of the goods in a 
warehouse. However, proviso (i) (B) says that in the case of any 
goods which are not likely to deteriorate and which are not 
intended for use in any hundred percent export oriented 
undertaking, the period specified in clauses (a), (aa) or (b) may, 
on sufficient cause being shown, be extended by the Principal 
Commissioner or Commissioner of Customs for a period not 

22 
 
 
 
exceeding six months and by the Principal Chief Commissioner 
or Chief Commissioner of Customs for further period as he may 
deem fit.   
 
35.  
Section 64 deals with owner’s right to deal with 
warehoused goods. Section 64, as it stood at the relevant point 
of time, read as under: 
64. Owner’s right to deal with warehoused 
goods.- With the sanction of the proper 
officer and on payment of the prescribed 
fees, the owner of any goods may either 
before or after warehousing the same- 
(a)  inspect the goods; 
(b)  separate damaged or deteriorated 
goods from the rest; 
(c)  sort the goods or change their 
containers for the purpose of 
preservation, 
sale, 
export 
or 
disposal of the goods;  
(d)  deal with the goods and their 
containers in such manner as may 
be necessary to prevent loss or 
deterioration or damage to the 
goods; 
(e)  show the goods for sale; or 
(f)  take samples of goods without 
entry for home consumption, and if 
the proper officer so permits, 
without payment of duty on such 
samples. 
 

23 
 
 
 
35.1.  
Thus, this section provided that the owner of any 
goods with the sanction of the proper officer and on payment of 
the prescribed fees may either before or after warehousing the 
same, deal with the goods and their containers in such manner 
as may be necessary to prevent loss or deterioration or damage 
to the goods. 
36.  
Section 67 deals with removal of goods from one 
warehouse to another. It says that the owner of any warehoused 
goods may with the permission of the proper officer, remove 
them from one warehouse to another subject to such conditions 
as may be prescribed for the due arrival of the warehoused 
goods at the warehouse to which removal is permitted. 
37.  
Heading of Section 68 is ‘Clearance of warehoused 
goods for home consumption’. This section, as it stood at the 
relevant point of time, provided that the importer of any 
warehoused goods may clear those goods from the warehouse 
for home consumption if – 
(a)  a bill of entry for home consumption in 
respect of such goods has been presented in 
the prescribed form; 

24 
 
 
 
(b) the import duty leviable on such goods 
and all penalties rent, interest and other 
charges payable in respect of such goods have 
been paid; and  
(c) 
an order for clearance of such goods for 
home consumption has been made by the 
proper officer. 
38.  
There is an embargo provided in Section 71 from 
taking out goods from a warehouse. As per Section 71, no 
warehoused goods shall be taken out of a warehouse except on 
clearance for home consumption or re-exportation or for 
removal to another warehouse or as otherwise provided by the 
Customs Act. 
39.  
Section 71 is followed by Section 72 which deals with 
goods improperly removed from warehouse, etc. As per sub-
Section(1)(b) where any warehoused goods have not been 
removed from a warehouse at the expiration of the period during 
which such goods are permitted under Section 61 to remain in 
a warehouse, the proper officer may demand and the owner of 
such goods shall forthwith pay, the full amount of duty 
chargeable on account of such goods together with all penalties, 

25 
 
 
 
rent, interest and other charges payable in respect of such 
goods. 
40.  
Once the goods covered by any bond executed under 
Section 59 have been cleared for home consumption or exported 
or transferred or are otherwise duly accounted for, and when all 
amounts due on account of such goods have been paid, the 
proper officer shall cancel the bond as discharged in full and 
deliver the same after cancellation to the person who has 
executed or is entitled to receive it. 
41.  
Section 110(1) of the Customs Act empowers the 
proper officer to seize any goods if he has reason to believe that 
such goods are liable to confiscation under the Customs Act. 
42.  
As per Section 111(j), any dutiable or prohibited 
goods removed or attempted to be removed from a customs area 
or a warehouse without the permission of the proper officer or 
contrary to the terms of such permission, shall be liable for 
confiscation. 
43.  
In the event of such an act, the concerned person 
shall be liable to pay penalty under Section 112.

Central Board of Excise and Customs had issued 
Circular No.98/95-Cus. dated 12.07.1989. Subject matter of 
this circular was what would be the relevant date for calculation 
of customs duty in cases where warehoused goods were cleared 
after expiry of the warehousing period. Reference was made to 
the instructions of the Board dated 17.03.1987 where it was 
clarified that in cases where warehoused goods were cleared 
from a warehouse after expiry of the bond period, the rate of 
duty would be the one which was prevalent on the date of expiry 
of the bond. The issue was reconsidered in the tripartite meeting 
held between the Ministry of Law, Department of Revenue and 
the Comptroller and Auditor General. It was observed in the 
meeting that  on expiry of the warehousing period, the goods 
kept in a warehouse ceased to be warehoused goods and, 
therefore, their removal from the warehouse could not be 
regarded as covered by the provisions of Section 15(1)(b) of the 
Customs Act. After noting that there was no specific legal 
provision to determine the rate of duty in such cases of 
warehoused goods where the bond period had expired, it was 
concluded that the residual clause of Section 15(1)(c) of the 
Customs Act could apply to cases where the goods were 

27 
 
 
 
removed from the warehouse after expiry of the warehousing 
period and that the rate of duty in such cases would be the rate 
prevalent on the date of payment of duty. It was further clarified 
that provisions of Section 15(1)(b) of the Customs Act would 
continue to apply in cases where goods were cleared from the 
warehouse after extension of the warehousing period but before 
expiry of the extended period for which applications from the 
importers for extension of the warehousing period should be 
received before expiry of the permitted period of warehousing. 
These conclusions reached in the tripartite meeting were 
accepted by the Board and by the aforesaid circular dated 
12.07.1989, 
direction 
was 
issued 
for 
their 
immediate 
implementation 
superseding 
the 
instructions 
dated 
17.03.1987. 
45.  
The above provision continued to hold the field till 
the decision of this Court in Kesoram Rayon versus Collector of 
Customs, Calcutta, (1996) 5 SCC 576. The question for 
consideration in Kesoram was the rate at which customs duty 
was to be levied on goods that remained in a bonded warehouse 
beyond the permitted period. A two judge bench of this Court 
after referring to various provisions of the Customs Act held that 

28 
 
 
 
Section 15(1)(b) would apply to the case of goods cleared under 
Section 68 from a warehouse upon presentation of a bill of entry 
for home consumption; payment of duty, interest, penalty, rent 
and other charges; and an order for home clearance. This Court 
clarified that provisions of Section 68 and consequently Section 
15(1)(b) would apply only when goods have been cleared from 
the warehouse within the permitted period or its permitted 
extension and not when by reason of their remaining in the 
warehouse beyond the permitted period or its permitted 
extension, the goods would be deemed to have been improperly 
removed from the warehouse under Section 72. In the facts of 
that case, it was found that there was nothing on record to 
suggest that clearance of the goods in question under Section 
68 was ordered and, therefore, Section 15(1)(b) had no 
application. Finally, this Court held that the consequence of 
non-removal of the warehoused goods within the permitted 
period or the permitted extension by virtue of Section 72 is 
certain. The date on which it comes to an end is the date 
relevant for determining the rate of duty; when the duty is in 
fact demanded is not relevant. 

29 
 
 
 
46.  
Following the decision of this Court in Kesoram, the 
Central Board of Excise and Customs issued Circular 
No.31/97-Cus. dated 14.08.1997. The Board held that in view 
of this Court’s judgment, the date of payment of duty in the case 
of warehoused goods removed after expiry of the permissible or 
extended period would be the date of expiry of the warehousing 
period or such other extended period, as the case may be, and 
not the date of payment of duty. Goods not removed from a 
warehouse within the permissible period or the extended period 
are to be treated as goods improperly removed from the 
warehouse.  
47.  
In Simplex Castings Ltd. versus Commissioner of 
Customs, Vishakhapatnam, (2003) 5 SCC 528, the appellant 
had questioned filing of appeal by the Commissioner before the 
CEGAT in view of the circular dated 12.07.1989 issued by the 
Central Board of Excise and Customs. It was argued that it was 
not open to the Commissioner to take the stand that non-
removal of the goods from the warehouse after the period of 
warehousing was over would be deemed removal from the 
warehouse and that the rate of duty would be leviable from the 
date the period of warehousing was over. The Commissioner 

30 
 
 
 
had appealed against the decision of the Collector of Customs 
(Appeals) in which the circular dated 12.07.1989 was followed. 
The appeal filed by the Commissioner was allowed by the 
CEGAT by relying upon the decision of this Court in Kesoram. 
This Court referred to its earlier decision in Paper Products Ltd. 
versus Commissioner of Central Excise, (1999) 7 SCC 84, and 
held that the circular dated 12.07.1989 was binding on the 
Department  and, therefore, it was not open to the Department 
to prefer appeal before CEGAT contrary to what was laid down 
in the circular dated 12.07.1989 in which it was specifically 
provided that the residual Section 15(1)(c) of the Customs Act 
would apply to cases where the goods were removed from a 
warehouse after expiry of the warehousing period and that the 
rate of duty in such cases would be the rate prevalent on the 
date of payment of duty. This Court noted that the aforesaid 
circular dated 12.07.1989 was withdrawn by the subsequent 
circular dated 14.08.1997. But, at the relevant point of time, 
the circular dated 12.07.1989 was holding the field. Thus, the 
appellate order passed by the Collector of Customs (Appeal) 
could not be said to be in anyway illegal or erroneous and, 
therefore, it was not open to the Department to challenge the 

31 
 
 
 
said order before the CEGAT in contravention of the circular 
dated 12.07.1989. 
48.  
The decision in Kesoram was approved and applied 
by a coordinate bench of this Court in SBEC Sugar Ltd versus 
Union of India, (2011) 4 SCC 668. This Court held that Section 
15(1)(b) would be applicable only when the goods are cleared 
from the warehouse under Section 68 of the Customs Act i.e. 
within the initially permitted period or during the permitted 
extended period. When the goods are cleared from the 
warehouse after expiry of the permitted period or its permitted 
extension, the goods are deemed to have been improperly 
removed under Section 72(1)(b) of the Customs Act with the 
consequence that the rate of duty has to be computed according 
to the rate applicable on the date of expiry of the permitted 
period under Section 61. 
49.  
Let us now briefly recap the facts. Appellant had 
imported second hand steel mill machinery and parts covered 
by three transit bonds totalling 595 cases. The customs 
authority had notified an open area of 2000 square meters 
within the industrial/factory premises of the appellant as a 

32 
 
 
 
public bonded warehouse. This open area was fenced and had 
gate with locking arrangement. The imported goods covered by 
the 595 cases were required to be warehoused in the said 
notified public bonded warehouse without payment of customs 
duty.   Appellant had written a letter dated 30.08.1989 to the 
concerned Superintendent seeking permission to unload a 
portion of the cargo outside the warehouse but within the 
factory premises. It was pointed out that the trailers carrying 
the consignment could not enter the said warehouse as because 
those trailers had got stuck in the soil outside the warehouse 
but within the factory premises as the soil had become very 
sluggish due to heavy rain and also because of paucity of space 
within the notified open area. The Superintendent gave 
permission on the body of the letter itself for unloading the 
cargo outside the warehouse but within the factory premises. 
The machinery parts which were thus unloaded were shifted to 
a shed outside the bonded warehouse but within the factory 
premises of the appellant so that those machinery parts did not 
get damaged, lying in the open and getting exposed to the 
elements. 

33 
 
 
 
49.1.  
Officials 
of 
the 
Preventive 
Branch 
of 
the 
Commissionerate searched the industrial premises of the 
appellant, including the notified public bonded warehouse, on 
07.08.1992 and physically verified the stock in the notified 
public bonded warehouse as well as outside but within the 
industrial/factory premises of the appellant. On such 
verification, it was found that only 304 cases were stocked 
inside the warehouse, whereas 264 cases were found outside 
the warehouse but within the industrial/factory premises of the 
appellant. Remaining 27 cases were neither found inside the 
warehouse nor outside the warehouse but within the 
industrial/factory premises of the appellant. 
49.2.  
After issuance of show cause notice and hearing, 
respondent passed adjudication order dated 28.08.1996 which 
suffered several rounds of appeals and remand. Ultimately, the  
Commissioner passed the final adjudication order dated 
28.04.2005 whereby demand of Rs.3,99,255.00 leviable on the 
27 cases found not warehoused was confirmed. Appellant was 
also directed to pay interest on the said duty in terms of Section 
28AB of the Customs Act. The 264 cases of imported goods 
found outside the notified warehouse were confiscated but 

34 
 
 
 
option of redemption was given to the appellant on payment of 
fine of Rs.2,00,000.00. For the goods covered by the 264 cases, 
customs duty amounting to Rs.39,03,821.00 was directed to be 
recovered from the appellant in terms of Section 71 read with 
the proviso to Section 28A of the Customs Act. That apart, 
appellant was directed to pay interest of Rs.18,88,425.00 on the 
aforesaid quantum of customs duty in respect of the 264 cases 
from the date of warehousing till the date of detection of the 
shortage in the warehouse. Further, appellant was directed to 
pay interest under Section 28AB in respect of the 264 cases 
from the date of enforcement of the said section to till the date 
of actual payment of the duty. Penalty of Rs.1,00,000.00 was 
also imposed on the appellant under Section 112 of the 
Customs Act.  
49.3.  
In appeal, CESTAT by the impugned order affirmed 
the aforesaid decision of the Commissioner.  
50.  
We may mention that the permission granted by the 
Superintendent to the appellant on 30.08.1989 to unload a 
portion of the cargo outside the open space which was notified 
as public bonded warehouse but within the factory premises of 

35 
 
 
 
the appellant was neither cancelled nor revoked by the 
Superintendent or even by the Commissioner. Infact, a view can 
reasonably be taken that the appellant as the owner of the goods 
had exercised its right under Section 64(d) which was endorsed 
by the Superintendent. Therefore, it would not be correct to say 
that the 264 cases found outside the notified warehouse but 
within the factory premises of the appellant were improperly or 
unauthorisedly removed from the notified public bonded 
warehouse. 
51.  
It has also come on record that Central Warehousing 
Corporation had deposited a sum of Rs.56,10,294.00 with the 
respondent as custom establishment charges in respect of the 
aforesaid notified public bonded warehouse for the period 1992-
1993 to 2007-2008. This would mean that the warehousing in 
the aforesaid notified public bonded warehouse continued 
during the said period. Thus, the period of warehousing had not 
expired and continued to remain operational in terms of the 
proviso to Section 61 of the Customs Act. 
52.  
This would further be borne out from the fact that it 
is not the case of the respondent that the 304 cases found inside 

36 
 
 
 
the notified warehouse were kept there beyond the warehousing 
period. In fact, the allegation of the respondent is that 264 cases 
were improperly or unauthorisedly removed from the notified 
warehouse as those were found lying outside the notified area 
but within the industrial/factory premises of the appellant. 
That apart, 27 cases were neither found inside the notified 
warehouse nor outside the said warehouse but within the 
factory premises of the appellant. 
53.  
In such a scenario, the provisions of Sections 71 and 
72 would not be applicable. Therefore, the decision of the 
respondent to invoke Section 71 and thereafter levy interest on 
the goods covered by the 264 cases under Section 28AB of the 
Customs Act was not justified. Since the imported goods 
covered by the 264 cases were never warehoused inside the 
notified public bonded warehouse but were unloaded outside 
the notified area but within the factory premises of the appellant 
and kept under a shed on permission granted by the 
Superintendent which permission was neither cancelled nor 
revoked, question of warehousing the goods covered by the 264 
cases within the notified public bonded warehouse did not arise. 
As a corollary, the further question of improperly or 

37 
 
 
 
unauthorisedly removing the 264 cases from the notified 
warehouse to outside the said area but within the factory 
premises of the appellant attracting Section 71 and the 
consequences following the same did not arise. Inference drawn 
by the respondent that the permission granted by the 
Superintendent was only temporary and therefore, the rigor of 
Section 71 would be attracted, in our view, would not be a 
correct understanding of the situation and the law. 
54.  
Having said that, we find that there is no explanation 
on the part of the appellant qua the missing 27 cases. Therefore, 
the view taken by the respondent and affirmed by the CESTAT 
that those 27 cases were improperly or unauthorisedly removed 
from the notified public bonded warehouse is correct and 
requires no interference.  
55.  
Reverting back to the 264 cases, we are of the view 
that in a case of this nature, Section 15(1)(b) would have no 
application. Rather, Section 15(1)(c) would be attracted. 
56.  
In so far the Board’s circular dated 12.07.1989 is 
concerned, the subject matter of the said circular was what 
would be the relevant date for calculation of customs duty in 
cases where warehoused goods were cleared after expiry of the 

38 
 
 
 
warehousing period. In that context, it was clarified that 
provisions of Section 15(1)(b) of the Customs Act would apply to 
cases where the goods were cleared from the warehouse after 
extension of the warehousing period but before expiry of such 
extended period. On the other hand, in respect of cases where 
the goods were removed after expiry of the warehousing period, 
the residual clause of Section 15(1)(c) of the Customs Act would 
apply. Evidently, this circular dated 12.7.1989 would not be 
applicable to the facts of the present case in as much as it is 
not the case of the respondent that either the warehousing 
period had expired or that the warehousing period was 
extended. As we have seen, the warehousing in the notified 
public bonded warehouse continued as the Corporation had 
deposited with the respondent a sum of Rs. 56,10,294.00 in 
respect of the notified warehouse as custom establishment 
charges for the period from 1992-1993 to 2007-2008. That 
apart, we can refer to the fact that respondent had not levied 
any customs duty on the 304 cases found within the notified 
area which would mean that the notified warehousing 
continued. Therefore, this is not a case where Section 15(1)(b) 
could have been invoked. 

39 
 
 
 
57.  
As regards, the decision of this Court in Kesoram is 
concerned, the question for consideration in that case was the 
rate at which customs duty could be levied on goods that 
remained in a bonded warehouse beyond the permitted period. 
It was in that context that this Court held that Section 68 would 
not be applicable since Section 68 operates in a different 
context. On the contrary, Section 72 would apply. Thus, this 
Court clarified that the date on which the warehousing period 
comes to an end, would be the date relevant for determining the 
rate of duty and when the duty is actually demanded would not 
be relevant. It was further clarified that Section 15(1)(b) would 
apply to goods cleared under Section 68. Goods which remain 
in the bonded warehouse beyond the permitted period would be 
deemed to have been improperly removed from the warehouse 
under Section 72. It is quite evident that this decision would not 
be applicable to the facts of the present case. 
58.  
Thus, having regard to the discussions made above, 
we are of the view that the demand raised by the respondent 
against the appellant and affirmed by the CESTAT qua the 264 
cases including levy of customs duty and interest cannot be 
sustained. Those are accordingly set aside and quashed. Parties 

40 
 
 
 
are directed to work out their remedies in respect of the 264 
cases of goods under Section 15(1)(c) of the Customs Act within 
a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this 
order. In so far the demand of customs duty and interest on the 
27 cases is concerned, the same is hereby sustained. The 
decision imposing penalty of rupees one lakh on the appellant 
under Section 112 of the Customs Act is also not disturbed in 
view of the conduct of the appellant in unauthorisedly removing 
the 27 cases of imported goods not only from the notified public 
bonded warehouse but also from the industrial/factory 
premises of the appellant. 
59.  
Impugned order of CESTAT would stand modified 
accordingly. 
60.  
Appeal is allowed in part in the above terms. No 
costs.
