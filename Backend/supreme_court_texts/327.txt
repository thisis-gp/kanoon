dated 12.03.20193 passed by the Trial Court was set aside as far as Section 
420, IPC is concerned against the respondent no.1/Sharmila Das and 
Section 420 read with Section 120-B, IPC against the respondent 
no.2/Usharani Das and respondent no.3/Sangita.  
3. 
 
Briefly the facts as available on record are that the marriage of 
the appellant was solemnized with the respondent no.1 on 28.04.2018 in 
the presence of the respondent nos. 2 and 3. Having come to know that on 
the date, the respondent no.1 had solemnized marriage with the 
appellant, she was already married and had not obtained divorce from 
her first husband, the appellant filed a petition4 under Section 11 of the 
1955 Act5 before Principal Judge, Family Court, Shivpuri (M.P.) seeking 
annulment of marriage between the appellant and the respondent no.1. 
4. 
 
Subsequently, the appellant preferred a complaint6 against 
the respondent nos.1, 2, and 3 in which the Magistrate vide order dated 
12.03.2019, after recording preliminary evidence and being satisfied that 
a prima facie case was made out, directed issuance of process against the 
respondent no.1 for the offences punishable under Sections 494 and 420

6 The Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Shivpuri (M.P.) under Sections 495, 420, 468, 471 and 506 read with 
Section 34, IPC 

Page 3 of 11 
 
read with Section 120-B, IPC, and against the respondent nos. 2 & 3 for the 
offence punishable under Section 420 read with Section 120-B, IPC. 
5. 
 
The aforesaid order was impugned by the accused 
persons/respondent nos. 1 to 3 by filing Revision Petition7 before the 4th 
Additional Sessions Judge, Shivpuri which was partly allowed by the 
Sessions Court. The impugned order dated 12.03.2019 passed by the 
Magistrate was set aside to the extent of taking cognizance of the offence 
punishable under section 420 of IPC against the respondent no.1 and for 
the offence punishable under section 420 read with section 120-B of IPC 
against the respondent nos.2 and 3. 
6. 
 
The appellant challenged the order of Sessions Court before 
the High Court. The same was upheld. It is against the aforesaid two 
orders, the appellant is before this Court. 
7. 
 
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that both the 
parties namely the appellant and the respondent no.1 came in contact 
through a matrimonial site (name withheld) and thereafter meetings were 
held at Visakhapatnam on 09.03.2018 and 10.03.2018 in the presence of 
the respondent nos.2 and 3. The respondent no.1 was earlier married as 
 
7 Criminal Revision No. 155 of 2019 

Page 4 of 11 
 
was even disclosed by her on the matrimonial site. At the time of meeting 
the appellant was shown a smudged copy of the divorce order passed in 
favour of the respondent no.1 on mobile phone. On the document, the 
date could not be clearly seen as the copy of the order was not clear. It 
was stated that the order is pending signatures of the Judge. Thereafter, 
the marriage of the parties was solemnized on 28.04.2018. The 
respondents dishonestly misrepresented that they are not financially 
well, and thereby induced the appellant to part with ₹ 2 lakhs and bear 
the entire expenses of the marriage.  
7.1 
 
On 16.06.2018, when respondent no.1 visited the doctor for a 
checkup, she was found to be pregnant. She wanted to undergo an 
abortion, but when confronted by the appellant, the reason therefore she 
told that she had not yet obtained divorce from her previous marriage. 
The document which was shown to him on mobile phone was forged. This 
shows that the consent for marriage was obtained dishonestly. The 
appellant was taken aback. When confronted, the respondent no.1 
threatened him of filing false cases, which may lead to his dismissal from 
Government service besides tarnishing his image.

7.2 
 
As the appellant was in shock, he was left with no option but to 
file complaint with the police on 08.07.2018. However, no action was taken 
on the complaint. Thereafter, the appellant preferred criminal complaint 
before the Magistrate on 20.07.2018. 
7.3 
 
Immediately after coming to know about the filing of the 
criminal complaint by the appellant, the respondent no.1 approached the 
Family Court, Panvel on 25.07.2018 where the Divorce Petition filed by 
her first husband under Sections 13(1)(i) and 13(1) (i-a) of the 1955 Act 
was pending for more than 6 months. The respondent no.1 filed an 
application seeking conversion thereof to a divorce by mutual consent 
under Section 13-B of the 1955 Act. After accepting the application the 
divorce was granted on the same day. 
7.4 
 
In the complaint filed by the appellant he led both 
documentary and oral evidence. Based on the evidence produced by the 
appellant, a prima facie case was established. Consequently, the 
Magistrate issued process against the respondents to face trial under 
Sections 494, 420, read with Section 120-B, IPC. 
7.5 
 
Aggrieved by the same, the respondents preferred Revision 
Petition before the Sessions Judge. However, without there being any 

Page 6 of 11 
 
valid reason, the Sessions Judge set aside the summoning order with 
reference to respondent no.1 under Section 420 of IPC and with reference 
to respondent nos.1 and 2 under Section 420 read with Section 120-B of 
IPC; and confirmed the order of Trial Court with reference to summons 
issued against respondent no.1 under section 494 of IPC. 
7.6 
 
Challenge was made by the appellant to the aforesaid order 
before the High Court raising the contention that the Court without 
appreciating the facts of the case, which are self-speaking, dismissed the 
Revision Petition. The impugned order deserves to be set aside, as a 
prima facie case is made out showing that the appellant had been 
dishonestly induced by the respondent nos.1, 2 and 3 to believe that the 
respondent no.1 had obtained divorce by showing him a forged order of 
divorce from earlier marriage knowing well that it had not yet been 
dissolved as on the date of marriage with the appellant, and thereby 
dishonestly induced him to marry respondent no.1. The respondents are 
liable to face trial under Section 420 read with Section 120-B, IPC for the 
reason that all of them had conspired with each other to dishonestly 
induce the appellant into marrying respondent no.1 and parting away 
with huge amount.

8. 
 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents 
submitted that even on the basis of the pleaded facts and the material 
produced by the appellant before the Magistrate, no offence under 
Section 420, IPC can be made out. It cannot be said to be a case of criminal 
conspiracy and no offence of cheating is made out against the 
respondents. There is no error in the orders passed by the Sessions Court 
or the High Court. There was no concealment or cheating at the behest of 
the respondents as they had clearly disclosed all the facts to the appellant 
from the very beginning. The appeal deserves to be dismissed. 
9. 
 
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the 
relevant referred record. 
10. 
 
The appellant and the respondent no.1 came in contact 
through a matrimonial site. The appellant was already divorced whereas 
the respondent no.1 had uploaded her status as “process of divorce is 
under consideration.” After initial conversation, the appellant along with 
his family members were invited to visit Visakhapatnam, where they had 
interaction with the respondents. At the time of the meeting the appellant 
was told that the respondent no.1 was earlier married at Mumbai and the 
divorce had already taken place. On being asked about the copy of the 

Page 8 of 11 
 
decree of divorce it was stated that the same is pending for signature of 
the Judge concerned and will be provided in due course. The 
respondents had shown to the appellants an unclear photocopy of the 
decree of divorce which was believed to be true. On 11.03.2018, the 
appellant gave his consent for the marriage. Date was fixed as 28.04.2018. 
The respondents pointed out that their financial condition was not good to 
come to Gwalior for the marriage along with their other relatives. As a 
result, the appellant booked tickets for the respondents and their 
relatives from Visakhapatnam to Gwalior and vice-versa, and also gave   
₹ 2 lakhs cash to the respondents as expenditure for marriage. 
11. 
 
On 16.06.2018, on account of some medical complication the 
appellant as well as the respondent no.1 rushed to the clinic of a lady 
doctor in Shivpuri (Madhya Pradesh), where couple resided after their 
marriage. The doctor disclosed that the respondent no.1 was pregnant. 
The joy of the appellant knew no bounds whereas the respondent no.1 
was very sad. The message was even conveyed to the family members of 
the appellant as well as the respondent no.1. The respondent nos.2 and 3 
were not happy. The appellant was surprised with the reaction. Later, 
when the reason was asked by the appellant from respondent no.1, he 

Page 9 of 11 
 
was told that she is yet to get divorce from her previous husband. It was a 
shock of life for the appellant. It was nothing else but cheating by showing 
a fake decree of divorce. It was for this reason only that the respondent 
no.1 wanted to get the pregnancy aborted. The appellant felt cheated. 
When he told that he would take action against the respondents, he was 
threatened with criminal cases of various matrimonial offences, which he 
claimed to have been filed. 
12. 
 
Written complaint was filed by the appellant to the 
Superintendent of Police of Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh on 07.07.2018 and 
to the Station in-Charge, Physical Shivpuri on 08.07.2018. However, no 
action was taken. It was thereafter, that the complaint was filed in the court 
before the Magistrate on 20.07.2018. The Trial Court after recording the 
preliminary evidence summoned the respondent no.1 to face trial under 
Sections 494 and 420 read with Section 120-B, IPC and the respondent 
nos.2 and 3 to face trial under Section 420 read with Section 120-B, IPC. 
12.1  
The aforesaid order was challenged by the respondents 
before the Additional Sessions Judge. The Sessions Court held that no 
offence punishable under Section 420 read with Section 120-B, IPC was 
made out as the factum of earlier marriage of the respondent no.1 was 

Page 10 of 11 
 
clearly disclosed to the appellant. The Sessions Judge failed to appreciate 
the fact that certain events had taken place thereafter, namely, apprising 
the appellant about the decree of divorce having been passed and 
showing the forged copy thereof to him on mobile. The Learned Sessions 
Court has considered the revision against the summoning order as if after 
trial the findings of conviction or acquittal was to be recorded. It was a 
preliminary stage of summoning. For summoning of an accused, prima 
facie case is to be made out on the basis of allegations in the complaint 
and the pre-summoning evidence led by the complainant. 
13. 
 
In a challenge by the appellant to the aforesaid order in the 
quashing petition, the High Court dismissed the petition without 
recording any reasons. 
14. 
 
Considering the material on record, in our opinion the 
approach of the Learned Sessions Court and the High Court in setting 
aside the summoning order against the accused persons i.e. respondent 
nos.1,2 and 3 under Section 420 read with Section 120-B IPC is not legally 
sustainable.  
15. 
 
For the reasons mentioned above from the facts as pleaded in 
complaint and the evidence led by the appellant, prima facie case was 

Page 11 of 11 
 
made out for issuing process against the respondents to face trial for the 
offence punishable under Section 420 read with Section 120-B, IPC, for 
which they were summoned. 
16. 
 
The appeal is accordingly allowed. The impugned orders 
passed by the High Court and the Sessions Court are set-aside and that of 
the Magistrate is restored. It is made clear that nothing said above shall 
be taken as final opinion on merits of the controversy. The Trial Court 
shall decide the case on its own merits on the basis of the evidence led by 
the parties.
