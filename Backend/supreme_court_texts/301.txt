Aligarh in Case No.129/2020 under Sections 
147, 342, 323, 307, 506 of the Indian Penal 
Code, 18603 Police Station, Civil Lines, District 
Aligarh. There is an order dated 01.11.2021 
passed by the High Court wherein the Case 
Number 
mentioned 
in 
the 
order 
dated 
24.08.2021 
was 
corrected 
as 
Case 
No.5727/2021.  
 
3.  
Respondent no.2 lodged a First Information 
Report4 bearing the aforesaid details whereupon 
the 
same 
was 
investigated 
and 
after 
investigation the police report under Section 
173(2) Cr.P.C. was submitted according to 
which the Investigating Officer found that no 
evidence could be collected which could 
substantiate the allegations made in the FIR.  
The said report was submitted to the Court 
concerned whereupon notices were issued to the 
informant.  The informant filed a Protest Petition 
along 
with 
affidavits 
to 
show 
that 
the 
investigation carried out by the Investigating 
 
3 IPC 
4 FIR

Officer was not a fair investigation. He had 
completed the case diary sitting at the Police 
Station 
without 
actually 
recording 
the 
statements of the witnesses.  
 
4.  
The CJM, by order dated 08.03.2021 rejected 
the police report under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. 
and further proceeded to take cognizance for 
offences under Sections 147, 342, 323, 307, 506 
of the IPC and under Section 190 (1) (b) of the 
Cr.P.C. and also directed that the matter would 
continue as a State case. Accordingly, it 
summoned the accused, fixed 30th April, 2021.  
This order of cognizance and summoning the 
present appellant was assailed before the High 
Court by way of a petition under Section 482 
Cr.P.C. registered as Application u/s.482 
No.15273 of 2021.  The said application has 
sine been dismissed by the High Court giving 
rise to the present appeal. 
 
5. 
Shri Vinod Prasad, learned senior counsel 
appearing for the appellant submitted that the 
CJM as also the High Court fell in error in taking 

 
SLP(CRL.) NO. 9122 OF 2021 
 
Page 4 of 14 
 
cognizance under Section 190(1)(b) Cr.P.C. 
inasmuch as the CJM had relied upon not only 
the Protest Petition which was supported by 
affidavit of the complainant but also on the 
affidavits of witnesses which were filed along 
with the Protest Petition to support the contents 
of the complaint.  The submission was that once 
the CJM was relying upon additional material in 
the 
form 
of 
evidence 
produced 
by 
the 
complainant along with the Protest Petition then 
the only option for the CJM was to treat it as a 
complaint under Section 200 Cr.P.C. and 
proceed accordingly. The said case could not 
have been continued as a State case and should 
have been treated as a private complaint. It was 
also submitted that it was open for the CJM to 
have rejected the police report submitted under 
Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. for closure and relying 
upon the material in the case diary, (in effect, 
the material collected during investigation) 
could 
have 
taken 
cognizance 
but 
once 
additional evidence was being relied upon which 
had been filed along with the Protest Petition 
then the only option open was to treat it as a 

 
SLP(CRL.) NO. 9122 OF 2021 
 
Page 5 of 14 
 
private complaint and after following the due 
procedure in Chapter XV of the Cr.P.C. 
proceeded to take cognizance under Section 
190(1)(a) Cr.P.C. 
 
6. 
On the other hand, the submission advanced by 
the learned counsel for the State as also the 
Complainant – respondent no.2 was that the 
CJM did not take into consideration any 
additional evidence filed in the form of affidavits 
along with the Protest Petition and had only 
relied upon the material collected during the 
investigation as contained in the case diary and 
based upon the same the satisfaction recorded 
by the CJM to reject the police report and take 
cognizance was well within his domain and such 
cognizance would fall within Section 190(1)(b) 
Cr.P.C.  It was thus submitted that the 
impugned order does not suffer from any 
infirmity. 
 
7. 
We have carefully examined the order dated 
24.08.2021 
passed 
by 
the 
CJM 
taking 
cognizance and summoning the police and we 

 
SLP(CRL.) NO. 9122 OF 2021 
 
Page 6 of 14 
 
find that the CJM had actually taken into 
consideration not only the Protest Petition but 
also the affidavit filed in support of the Protest 
Petition as well as the four affidavits of 
witnesses filed along with the Protest Petition. It 
was based on consideration of such affidavits 
that the CJM was of the view that the 
investigation was not a fair investigation and 
these affidavits made out a prima facie case for 
taking cognizance and summoning the accused.   
 
8.  
Once we have held as above without going into 
many judgments of this Court on the point as to 
how the Magistrate would proceed under 
Section 190 Cr.P.C. once the Investigating 
Officer had submitted a closure report under 
Section 173(2) Cr.P.C., we may briefly deal with 
the legal issue and refer to relevant paragraphs 
of a recent decision. In this connection, Section 
190(1) (a) and (b) of Cr.P.C. is extracted 
hereunder:

190. Cognizance of offences by Magistrates. 
(1)Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, any 
Magistrate of the first class, and any Magistrate of 
the second class specially empowered in this behalf 
under sub-section  
(2), may take cognizance of any offence – 
(a)upon receiving a complaint of facts which 
constitute such offence; 
(b)upon a police report of such facts;….” 
 
9.  
In the case of Vishnu Kumar Tiwari vs. State 
of Uttar Pradesh, through Secretary Home, 
Civil Secretariat, Lucknow & Anr.,5 Justice 
K.M.Joseph, speaking for the Bench laid down 
the legal position relying upon previous 
judgments of this Court.  In the said case the 
facts were quite similar to that of the present 
case where affidavits were filed along with the 
Protest Petition. The net result is that the 
Magistrate in the present case ought to have 
treated the Protest Petition as a complaint and 
proceeded according to Chapter XV of the 
Cr.P.C.. The relevant paragraphs dealing with 
 
5 (2019) 8 SCC 27 

 
SLP(CRL.) NO. 9122 OF 2021 
 
Page 8 of 14 
 
the above aspect in the case of Vishnu Kumar 
Tiwari (supra), being paragraphs 42 to 46 are 
reproduced hereunder: 
“42. In the facts of this case, having regard to 
the nature of the allegations contained in the 
Protest Petition and the annexures which 
essentially consisted of affidavits, if the 
Magistrate was convinced on the basis of the 
consideration 
of 
the 
final 
report, 
the 
statements under Section 161 of the Code that 
no prima facie case is made out, certainly the 
Magistrate could not be compelled to take 
cognizance by treating the Protest Petition as a 
complaint. The fact that he may have 
jurisdiction in a case to treat the Protest 
Petition as a complaint, is a different matter. 
Undoubtedly, if he treats the Protest Petition as 
a complaint, he would have to follow the 
procedure prescribed under Sections 200 and 
202 of the Code if the latter section also 
commends itself to the Magistrate. In other 
words, necessarily, the complainant and his 
witnesses would have to be examined. No 
doubt, depending upon the material which is 
made available to a Magistrate by the 
complainant in the Protest Petition, it may be 
capable of being relied on in a particular case 
having regard to its inherent nature and impact 
on the conclusions in the final report. That is, 
if the material is such that it persuades the 
court to disagree with the conclusions arrived 

 
SLP(CRL.) NO. 9122 OF 2021 
 
Page 9 of 14 
 
at by the investigating officer, cognizance could 
be taken under Section 190(1)(b) of the Code for 
which there is no necessity to examine the 
witnesses under Section 200 of the Code. But 
as the Magistrate could not be compelled to 
treat the Protest Petition as a complaint, the 
remedy of the complainant would be to file a 
fresh complaint and invite the Magistrate to 
follow the procedure under Section 200 of the 
Code or Section 200 read with Section 202 of 
the Code. Therefore, we are of the view that in 
the facts of this case, we cannot support the 
decision of the High Court. 
 43. It is true that law mandates notice to the 
informant/complainant where the Magistrate 
contemplates accepting the final report. On 
receipt of notice, the informant may address 
the court ventilating his objections to the final 
report. This he usually does in the form of the 
Protest 
Petition. 
In Mahabir 
Prasad 
Agarwala v. State [Mahabir 
Prasad 
Agarwala v. State, 1957 SCC OnLine Ori 5 : 
AIR 1958 Ori 11] , a learned Judge of the High 
Court of Orissa, took the view that a Protest 
Petition is in the nature of a complaint and 
should be examined in accordance with the 
provisions of Chapter XVI of the Criminal 
Procedure Code. We, however, also noticed that 
in Qasim v. State [Qasim v. State, 1984 SCC 
OnLine All 260 : 1984 Cri LJ 1677] , a learned 
Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at 
Allahabad, inter alia, held as follows: (Qasim 

 
SLP(CRL.) NO. 9122 OF 2021 
 
Page 10 of 14 
 
case [Qasim v. State, 1984 SCC OnLine All 260 
: 1984 Cri LJ 1677] , SCC OnLine All para 6) 
“6. … 
In Abhinandan 
Jha [Abhinandan 
Jha v. Dinesh Mishra, AIR 1968 SC 117 : 1968 
Cri LJ 97 : (1967) 3 SCR 668] also what was 
observed was “it is not very clear as to whether 
the Magistrate has chosen to treat the Protest 
Petition as complaint”. This observation would 
not mean that every Protest Petition must 
necessarily be treated as a complaint whether 
it satisfies the conditions of the complaint or 
not. A private complaint is to contain a complete 
list of witnesses to be examined. A further 
examination of complainant is made under 
Section 200 CrPC. If the Magistrate did not 
treat the Protest Petition as a complaint, the 
Protest Petition not satisfying all the conditions 
of the complaint to his mind, it would not mean 
that the case has become a complaint case. In 
fact, in majority of cases when a final report is 
submitted, the Magistrate has to simply 
consider whether on the materials in the case 
diary no case is made out as to accept the final 
report or whether case diary discloses a prima 
facie case as to take cognizance. The Protest 
Petition in such situation simply serves the 
purpose of drawing Magistrate's attention to the 
materials in the case diary and invite a careful 
scrutiny and exercise of the mind by the 
Magistrate so it cannot be held that simply 
because there is a Protest Petition the case is to 
become a complaint case.”

(emphasis supplied) 
 44. We 
may 
also 
notice 
that 
in Veerappa v. Bhimareddappa [Veerappa v. B
himareddappa, 2001 SCC OnLine Kar 447 : 
2002 Cri LJ 2150] , the High Court of 
Karnataka observed as follows: (SCC OnLine 
Kar para 9) 
“9. From the above, the position that 
emerges is this: Where initially the complainant 
has not filed any complaint before the 
Magistrate under Section 200 CrPC, but, has 
approached the police only and where the 
police after investigation have filed the ‘B’ 
report, if the complainant wants to protest, he 
is thereby inviting the Magistrate to take 
cognizance under Section 190(1)(a) CrPC on a 
complaint. If it were to be so, the Protest 
Petition that he files shall have to satisfy the 
requirements of a complaint as defined in 
Section 2(d) CrPC, and that should contain 
facts that constitute offence, for which, the 
learned Magistrate is taking cognizance under 
Section 190(1)(a) CrPC. Instead, if it is to be 
simply styled as a Protest Petition without 
containing all those necessary particulars that 
a normal complaint has to contain, then, it 
cannot be construed as a complaint for the 
purpose of proceeding under Section 200 
CrPC.” 
 45. “Complaint” is defined in Section 2(d) of 
the Code as follows: 

 
SLP(CRL.) NO. 9122 OF 2021 
 
Page 12 of 14 
 
“2. (d) “complaint” means any allegation 
made orally or in writing to a Magistrate, with 
a view to his taking action under this Code, 
that some person, whether known or unknown, 
has committed an offence, but does not include 
a police report. 
Explanation.—A report made by a police 
officer in a case which discloses, after 
investigation, the commission of a non-
cognizable offence shall be deemed to be a 
complaint; and the police officer by whom such 
report is made shall be deemed to be the 
complainant;” 
 46. If 
a 
Protest 
Petition 
fulfils 
the 
requirements of a complaint, the Magistrate 
may treat the Protest Petition as a complaint 
and deal with the same as required under 
Section 200 read with Section 202 of the Code. 
In this case, in fact, there is no list of witnesses 
as such in the Protest Petition. The prayer in 
the Protest Petition is to set aside the final 
report and to allow the application against the 
final report. While we are not suggesting that 
the form must entirely be decisive of the 
question whether it amounts to a complaint or 
is liable to be treated as a complaint, we would 
think that essentially, the Protest Petition in 
this case, is summing up of the objections of 
the second respondent against the final report.” 
  
 

 
SLP(CRL.) NO. 9122 OF 2021 
 
Page 13 of 14 
 
10. From a perusal of the above opinion of this 
Court, it is also reflected that the Magistrate 
also had the liberty to reject the Protest Petition 
along with all other material which may have 
been filed in support of the same. In that event 
the Complainant would be at liberty to file a 
fresh complaint.  The right of the Complainant 
to file a petition under Section 200 Cr.P.C. is not 
taken away even if the Magistrate concerned 
does not direct that such a Protest Petition be 
treated as a complaint.  
 
11.  In the present case as the Magistrate had 
already recorded his satisfaction that it was a 
case worth taking cognizance and fit for 
summoning the accused, we are of the view that 
the Magistrate ought to have followed the 
provisions and the procedure prescribed under 
Chapter XV of the Cr.P.C. Accordingly, we allow 
this appeal, set aside the impugned orders 
passed by the High Court as also the CJM, 
Aligarh.   
 

 
SLP(CRL.) NO. 9122 OF 2021 
 
Page 14 of 14 
 
12. However, we leave it open for the Magistrate to 
treat the Protest Petition as a complaint and 
proceed in accordance to law as laid down under 
Chapter XV of the Cr.P.C. We make it clear that 
we have not made any comments on the merits 
of the matter and any observations made would 
not influence the CJM in taking an appropriate 
decision as required above.
