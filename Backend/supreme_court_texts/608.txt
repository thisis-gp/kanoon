3. 
The appellant raised a bill for Rs. 77,85,290 and that was in 
addition to seven other claims under different heads, owing to 
alleged delays on part of the Respondent. As the respondent denied 
any liability, the dispute was referred to Arbitration for resolution.  
4. 
The Arbitrator gave his award on 30.01.2018, holding the 
respondents are liable to the tune of Rs.1,37,25,252, with interest. 
There were seven claims. Claim no. 1 related to loss of business, 
with respect to which Rs. 3,87,530 was awarded; claim no. 2 
related to uneconomic utilization of plant and machinery, with 
respect to which Rs. 61,22,000 was awarded and claim no. 3 
related to labour charges for uneconomical stoppage of work, with 
respect to which Rs.5,80,500 was awarded; claim no. 4 related to 
interest on delayed payment of running account bills and escalation 
bill for which the Arbitrator awarded Rs. 54,84,024; claim no. 5 
related to escalation with respect to which Rs.11,51,198 was 
granted; and claim 6 related to interest on the sum awarded, with 
respect to which interest @12% p.a. was awarded from 12.04.2016 
to 30.01.2018 and @ 9.25% p.a. post award interest till date of 
actual payment. Finally claim no.7 pertained to costs and the 
Arbitrator awarded 4 lakhs to the appellant, being the successful 
party.

4.1. The Respondents challenged the award under Section 34 of 
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 19961 and it was allowed in 
part by the District Judge setting aside claim no. 1 for loss of 
business, since the same had never been claimed by the appellant 
and was thus beyond the Arbitrator’s jurisdiction. Claim no. 2 for 
uneconomic utilization of plant and machinery was also set aside 
because the Arbitrator didn’t account for the loss of 135 days at 
the behest of the appellant while determining the alleged 200 days 
of ‘wasted machine’. 
4.2. Aggrieved by the decision of the District Judge, the appellant 
filed an appeal under Section 37 of the Act against the order setting 
aside the award on claims 1 and 2. On the other hand, the 
Respondent filed a cross appeal seeking setting aside of the rest of 
the claims as well. By the order impugned before us, the Calcutta 
High Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 37 of the Act set 
aside claim no.1 as well as claim nos. 3 and 4, but restored the 
Award with respect to claim no.2. However, while retaining claim 
no. 5 as it is, the High Court slightly modified claim no. 6 relating 
to pre-reference interest.

6. 
Mr. Saurav Agarwal, counsel for the appellant, confined his 
submissions to claim no. 3, 4 and 6 awarded by the Arbitrator and 

6 
 
upheld by the District Judge but set aside/modified by the High 
Court. We will deal with each of these claims. 
7. 
Re claim no. 3: This claim relating to loss caused due to idle 
labour, machinery, etc.  
7.1. On this count, the Arbitrator accepted the claim of loss on 
the ground of on-site establishment ‘as permissible’ to the extent 
of 3% of the contract amount by the Hudson’s formula for expenses 
of engineers, supervisors, etc. It was his considered view that the 
appellant maintained such an establishment to execute the work 
and the same has not been disputed by the Respondent. Therefore, 
he awarded claim no. 3 in favour of the appellant for Rs.5,80,500. 
7.2. The challenge to the Award made by the Respondent was 
dismissed by the District Judge under Section 34, holding that the 
findings of the Arbitrator cannot be held to be irrational, insensible 
or unrealistic and also that they are not in conflict with public 
policy. We may state at this very stage that this common reasoning 
of the District Court while upholding the Award for claim nos. 3, 
4, 5 and 6. The standard reasoning of the District Court for these 
claims is as follows: 
“I have gone through the observation of the learned 
Arbitrator in respect of claim Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6. On 
meticulous scrutiny of the award with reference to the 
documents produced by the parties to the ease, I find that 

7 
 
the reasons and findings given by the learned Arbitrator 
cannot be said to be irrational, insensible or unrealistic. In 
fact, award in respect of claim Nos. 3, 4, 5 & 6 cannot be 
said to be.in conflict with the public policy of India even by 
stretch of Imagination. On the other hand, it is apparent that 
cogent and acceptable reasons have been furnished by the 
learned Arbitrator in respect of these four heads of claims 
(claim Nos. 3 to 6). The award in respect of such four claims 
does not call for any interference.” 
 
7.3. While exercising jurisdiction under Section 37, the High 
Court examined the relevant clauses of the contract and held the 
claim is impermissible under the contractual provisions. They are 
extracted herein below for ready reference.  
''SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
CONDITION IN EXTENDED PERIOD  
As Clause 4 of W.B.F. 2908 or Clause 5 of W.B.F. No.2911 
(ii) as the case may be when an extension of time for 
completion of work is authorised by the Engineer-In-Charge, 
it will be taken for granted that the validity of the contract 
is extended automatically upon the extended period with all 
terms and conditions rates, etc. remaining unaltered, i.e. the 
tender is revalidated upon the extended period.  
EXTENSION OF TIME  
For cogent reasons over which the contractor will have no 
control and which will retard the· progress, extension of time 
for the period lost will be granted on receipt of application 
from the contractor before the expiry date of contract. No 
claim whatsoever for idle labour, additional establishment, 
cost of materials and labour and hire charges of tools & 
Plants etc. would be entertained under any circumstances. 
The contractor should consider the above factor while 
quoting this rate. Applications for such extension of time 
should be submitted by the contractor in the manner 
indicated in Clause 5 of the printed form of W.B.F. No. 2911 
(ii).  
IDLE LABOUR Whatever the reasons may be no claim or idle 
labour, 
enhancement 
of 
labour 
rate 
additional 
establishment cost, cost of TOLL and hire and labour 
charges of tools and plants Railway freight etc. would be 
entertained under any circumstances." 
 

8 
 
7.4. Mr. Saurav Agarwal submitted that the High Court under 
Section 37 ignored the plausible view of the Arbitrator, as upheld 
under Section 34, and substituted it with its own reasoning. 
7.5. This submission is persuasive, but the contract clauses 
speak for themselves. In fact, High Court did what the Arbitrator 
should have done. Examine what the contract provides.  This is 
not even a matter of interpretation. It is the duty of every Arbitral 
Tribunal and Court alike and without exception, for contract is the 
foundation of the legal relationship. Having considered the above 
referred clauses in the Contract the High Court came to the 
conclusion that awarding any amount towards idle, machinery, 
etc. is prohibited under the ‘Special Terms and Conditions’ of the 
Contract. The Arbitrator did not even refer to the contractual 
provisions and the District Court dismissed the objections under 
Section 34 with a standard phrase as extracted hereinabove. High 
Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 37 did its duty and we 
are of the opinion that the conclusions of the High Court are 
correct and cannot be interfered with.  
8. 
Re claim no. 4: This claim relates to interest on delayed 
payment of running account bills. 

9 
 
8.1. The Arbitrator held that the Claimant is entitled to receive 
compensation for any loss and/or damage of capital which arose 
naturally from breach or which parties knew to be likely to arise 
from breach. Payments on running account bills is guided by 
clause 7 of the Contract and there is no prohibition in the contract 
regarding payment of interest on the ‘blocked capital’. Therefore, 
holding that the injured party ought to be placed in the same 
financial position he would have been but for the other party’s 
fault, the Arbitrator awarded interest on delayed payments at the 
rate of 12% p.a., which was quantified to Rs. 54,84,024. As 
indicated above, the District Court upheld the Award. 
8.2. The relevant portion of the Award is as follows:- 
“23.1… As the claimant is entitled to payment of R/A bills 
when the amount is Rs. 1 crore and above, I accept the 
statements/calculation 
made 
by 
the 
claimant 
vide 
Statement submitted before the arbitral tribunal for Rs. 
82,26,036/-. In compliance of direction issued by MOM no. 
21 dated 24.7.2017, based on work value of Rs. one crore.  
Such statement giving all details covering the criteria of bill 
value of Rs. 1 crore was served to respondent and there was 
no comment on such statement whatsoever. Payment of 
R/A bills is guided only by the provision under clause 7 with 
amendment thereon. Claimant claimed interest @ 18% p.a. 
which is not allowed. I restrict rate of interest @ 12% p.a. 
only and thereby the admissible amount of the claim stands 
at Rs. 54,84,024/- [Rs. 82,26,036 ÷ 18 X 12] 
23.2 The claimant notified loss of interest during the 
execution period under Interest Act (vide annexure-K, page 
109, Annexure-m page-112, annexure-O, page 115, annex.-
R1, page-119 & 122 with claimant’s document).  Moreover, 
such payment is out of the written contract for executed 

10 
 
quantities. There is no prohibition in the contract for 
payment of interest on blocked capital. The claimant is 
otherwise entitled to receive payment on account of interest 
on blocked capital.  Such principle of law is laid down in the 
case of Secretary, Irrigation Department Government of 
Orissa Vs. G.C. Ray reported in (1992) 1 SCC 508. The 
claimant is entitled to receive compensation for any loss or 
damage and/or blockage of capital which arose naturally 
from the breach or which the parties knew to be likely to 
arrive from such breach. The injured party is to be placed in 
the same financial position, as he would have been in, if the 
other party had duly carried out the contract, i.e., to place 
the injured party in the same position if the contract has 
been performed. I award Rs. 54,84,024/- only.” 
 
8.3. Mr. Saurav Agarwal submitted that the payments became 
due when the gross amount of work done exceeded Rs.1 crore, 
therefore the delay was to be accounted for from this date. The 
error, he submits is because the High Court relied on chart 
submitted by the respondents, unlike the Arbitrator and the 
District judge who relied on appellant’s chart.  
8.4. High Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 37 merely 
recounted the dates on which the bills were raised, and the 
payments made. Thereafter High Court formulated certain 
questions, which it felt that the Arbitrator and the District Judge 
should have answered, but failed to hold any discussion on such 
questions.  In this view of the matter, the High Court proceeded to 
set aside Award of claim no. 4.  The relevant portion of the High 
Court Judgment is as follows:- 

11 
 
“The learned Arbitrator proceeded on the basis of the 
statement submitted by the appellant that there was 
delay in the payment of these bills. The unpaid running 
account bills were described as “blocked capital”.  He 
viewed the delay in receiving “this blocked capital” as 
“loss and damage” to the appellant and granted Rs. 
54,84,024/- on that reasoning, as “interest”. 
 
The learned Judge upheld this award.  It is challenged 
by the respondent.  The respondent relies on Clauses 
7, 8 and 9 of the contract by which monthly bills had 
to be raised by the appellant on the measurement 
made. These payments against the monthly running 
account bills were to be treated as advance under 
Clause 7. Payment could have been made only when 
the gross amount exceeded Rs. 1 crore. According to 
the respondent no bill was raised by the appellant.  
According to the statement of claim of the appellant, 
the first bill for Rs. 1,32,91,180/- was prepared on 29th 
August, 2011 and paid on or about 30th August 2011.  
Similarly, the second was prepared on 7th February, 
2012 and paid on 9th February, 2012.  The third and 
fourth 
bills 
for 
Rs. 
1,28,23,488/- 
and 
Rs. 
1,30,90,000/- respectively were prepared on 5th 
March, 2012 and paid between 30th March, 2012 and 
20th June, 2012. The fifth bill for Rs. 3,14,82,214/- 
was prepared on 6th July, 2012 and paid between 24th 
July, 2012 and 1st October, 2012.  The sixth bill was 
raised on 5th July, 2012 and paid between 6th July, 
2012 and 1st October, 2012.  The work was completed 
on 9th November, 2012. 
What the learned Arbitrator did not determine were the 
following: 
a) Who was responsible for non-preparation of the RA bill 
within time? 
b) Which of the RA bill claims of the appellant were to be 
treated as advance under the above clause of the 
contract? 
c) Was any notice under the Interest Act, 1978 issued by 
the appellant and to what effect? 
d) For what amount and for which period the claim for 
interest was being entertained and granted by him? 
From the above narration of facts it appears that the 
bills were paid soon after they were prepared.  In that 
case there could not have been any claim for interest.  
If a claim for interest has been made for running 
account bill below one crore, under the said terms it is 

12 
 
to be treated as a claim for interest for unpaid advance.  
No right to claim interest arose. 
Now, unless these facts were established by the 
appellant and discussed by the learned Arbitrator to 
show that there was delay in the preparation of the 
bills by the respondent, that those bills were over one 
crore and not be treated as advance and that the right 
to obtain payment thereof arose on their due 
submission and service of a notice under the Interest 
Act, 1978, the award of interest could not be justified. 
Total absence of discussion of these facts signifies that 
the learned Arbitrator completely failed to exercise its 
jurisdiction….” 
 
8.5. The conclusion of the High Court, “that it appears that the 
bills were paid soon after they were prepared” or that, “in that case 
there could not have been any claim for interest” cannot qualify as 
grounds for interference under Section 37.  Equally, the approach 
of the High Court in holding that the Arbitrator neither established 
nor discussed the questions posed by it is not a ground to set aside 
the Award. The reasoning of the Arbitrator is reflected in that 
portion of the Award extracted hereinabove and we see nothing 
perverse in it.  Nor such conclusion is against our public policy. 
The scope of Section 37 is enunciated in many decisions of this 
Court, and we apply the principles laid down therein to the facts 
of the present case. 
8.6. For these reasons, we set aside the judgment of the High 
Court in relation to claim no. 4 and restore the Award and thereby 
the judgment of the District Court upholding the Award. 

13 
 
9. 
Re claim no. 6: This claim relates to Interest  
9.1. Arbitrator awarded interest @12% on sum awarded from 
12.04.2016, which is the date when appellant claimed breach of 
contract, to 30.01.2018, which is the date of the Award, and 
further interest @ 9.25% p.a. from date of Award till actual 
payment. This was confirmed by the District Judge under Section 
34. 
9.2.  High Court held that the contract between the parties 
prohibits grant of pre-reference interest and therefore interest 
could not have been granted for this period. As per the High Court, 
as the Arbitrator could have granted interest only for pendent lite 
and post award, the Award was modified directing - pendente lite 
interest @12% p.a. from 03.08.2016 till date of award i.e. 
30.01.2018, along with post award interest @ 9.25% p.a.  
9.3.  The learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that 
the award for interest is within the domain of the Arbitrator under 
Section 31(7) and ought not to be substituted by courts under 
Section 34 or 37.  
9.4. Section 31(7) of the Act determines the grant of interest. The 
relevant provision is extracted hereunder for ready reference. 
 

14 
 
“31. Form and contents of arbitral award.— 
(7) (a) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where and in so 
far as an arbitral award is for the payment of money, the arbitral 
tribunal may include in the sum for which the award is made 
interest, at such rate as it deems reasonable, on the whole or any 
part of the money, for the whole or any part of the period between 
the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on 
which the award is made. 
(b) A sum directed to be paid by an arbitral award shall, unless 
the award otherwise directs, carry interest at the rate of two per 
cent higher than the current rate of interest prevalent on the date 
of award, from the date of award to the date of payment.  
Explanation.—The expression “current rate of interest” 
shall have the same meaning as assigned to it under clause (b) 
of section 2 of the Interest Act, 1978 (14 of 1978).” 
 
9.5. The power of the Arbitrator to grant pre-reference interest, 
pendente lite interest, and post-award interest under Section 31(7) 
of the Act is fairly well-settled. The judicial determinations also 
highlight the difference in the position of law under the Arbitration 
Act, 1940. The following propositions can be summarised from a 
survey of these cases: 
I. 
Under the Arbitration Act, 1940, there was no specific 
provision that empowered an Arbitrator to grant interest. 
However, through judicial pronouncements, this Court has 
affirmed the power of the Arbitrator to grant pre-reference, 
pendente lite, and post-award interest on the rationale that a 
person who has been deprived of the use of money to which 
he is legitimately entitled has a right to be compensated for 

15 
 
the same.2 When the agreement does not prohibit the grant 
of interest and a party claims interest, it is presumed that 
interest is an implied term of the agreement, and therefore, 
the Arbitrator has the power to decide the same.3 
II. 
Under the 1940 Act, this Court has adopted a strict 
construction of contractual clauses that prohibit the grant of 
interest and has held that the Arbitrator has the power to 
award interest unless there is an express, specific provision 
that excludes the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator4 from 
awarding interest for the dispute in question5. 
III. 
Under the 1996 Act, the power of the Arbitrator to grant 
interest is governed by the statutory provision in Section 
31(7). This provision has two parts. Under sub-section (a), the 
Arbitrator can award interest for the period between the date 
of cause of action to the date of the award, unless otherwise

agreed by the parties. Sub-section (b) provides that unless 
the award directs otherwise, the sum directed to be paid by 
an arbitral award shall carry interest at the rate of 2% higher 
than the current rate of interest, from the date of the award 
to the date of payment. 
IV. 
The wording of Section 31(7)(a) marks a departure from 
Arbitration Act, 1940 in two ways: first, it does not make an 
explicit distinction between pre-reference and pendente lite 
interest as both of them are provided for under this sub-
section; second, it sanctifies party autonomy and restricts the 
power to grant pre-reference and pendente lite interest the 
moment the agreement bars payment of interest, even if it is 
not a specific bar against the Arbitrator.6  
V. 
The power of the Arbitrator to award pre-reference and 
pendente lite interest is not restricted when the agreement is

Development Corporation India Limited, (2019) 17 SCC 786, paras 13-15; Delhi Airport Metro

17 
 
silent on whether interest can be awarded7 or does not 
contain a specific term that prohibits the same8. 
VI. 
While pendente lite interest is a matter of procedural law, pre-
reference interest is governed by substantive law.9 Therefore, 
the grant of pre-reference interest cannot be sourced solely 
in Section 31(7)(a) (which is a procedural law), but must be 
based on an agreement between the parties (express or 
implied), statutory provision (such as Section 3 of the Interest 
Act, 1978), or proof of mercantile usage10. 
9.6. In view of the above, the High Court had no reason to interfere 
with the Arbitral Award with respect to grant of pre-reference
