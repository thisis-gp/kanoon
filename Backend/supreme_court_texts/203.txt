3. 
On the basis of the Intelligence, the goods were 
examined 100% by SIIB officers.  It was alleged that the goods 
were 
grossly 
undervalued. 
After 
taking 
representative 
samples, the goods were detained for further investigation.  
On 21st February 2018, the goods were seized on the ground 
that 
the 
same 
were 
found 
to 
be 
mis-declared 
and 
undervalued.  Statements under Section 108 of the Customs 
Act of the respondent and the customs broker were recorded 
on 23rd February 2018.  The appellant's past import details 
were retrieved from the system, and it was found that the 
importer had imported identical/similar items with the same 

 
 
 
Civil Appeal no.9385 of 2022 
 
 
 
    Page 3 of 11 
 
model numbers at higher and different unit prices.  The 
appellant submitted a letter dated 7th March 2018 to the 
Commissioner of Customs (Import), New Delhi, stating that 
the goods were imported from the manufacturer supported by 
the manufacturer’s invoice and that the value of the goods 
was listed on some of the well-known online trading and B2B 
websites.  The appellant relied upon the letter dated 16th 
January 2018 from the manufacturer stating that the goods 
were of a lower version.  The Department claims to have 
conducted a market survey on 26th March 2018.   
4. 
The order-in-original dated 31st March 2018 was passed 
by 
the 
adjudicating 
authority 
rejecting 
the 
declared 
assessable value of Rs.12,87,742/- for the goods imported 
under Bill of Entry dated 16th February 2018 in terms of Rule 
12 of the Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of 
Imported Goods) Rules, 2007 (for short, ‘the Valuation Rules’) 
read with Section 14 of the Customs Act.  The adjudicating 
authority assessed the value of the imported goods at 
Rs.66,18,575/-.  The adjudicating authority ordered recovery 
of differential customs duty of Rs.16,22,228/-.  An order of 
confiscation under Section 111 of the Customs Act was 
passed, giving the appellant an option to redeem the goods on 
payment 
of 
a 
redemption 
fine 
of 
Rs.9,93,000/. 
The 
adjudicating authority imposed penalties of Rs.2,00,000/- 
and Rs.3,31,000/- on the importer under Sections 112(a) and 
114AA respectively of the Customs Act.  The appellant 
preferred an appeal before the Commissioner of Customs 

 
 
 
Civil Appeal no.9385 of 2022 
 
 
 
    Page 4 of 11 
 
(Appeals). The Commissioner allowed the said appeal by the 
judgment dated 17th December 2020. On 2nd November 2021, 
the Committee of Commissioners, in the exercise of powers 
under sub-section (2) of Section 129A of the Customs Act, 
directed the Department to file an appeal against the order 
dated 17th December 2020.  Accordingly, an appeal was 
preferred before the CESTAT on 17th November 2021.  By 
impugned judgment dated 29th September 2022, the appeal 
was allowed, and the CESTAT restored the order-in-original 
passed by the adjudicating authority.  
SUBMISSIONS 
5. 
The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant 
has taken us through the impugned order.  His first 
submission is that the review order passed by the Committee 
of Commissioners under sub-section (2) of Section 129A was 
hopelessly time-barred as the same was passed after a lapse 
of more than 10 months from the date of the order of the 
Commissioner (Appeals).  His second submission is that 
CESTAT completely ignored the definitions of ‘identical’ and 
‘similar’ goods under the Valuation Rules.  He submitted that 
the finding that the goods imported by the appellant in the 
past were similar or identical is completely erroneous, as the 
earlier goods purchased were not comparable at all.  Coming 
to the first Item of the Camera Stand (3-axis Stabilizer-
CRA02, Unpopular Brand), he submitted that the said Item 
was completely different from the Item imported by the 
appellant with a Bill of Entry dated 13th November 2017, 

 
 
 
Civil Appeal no.9385 of 2022 
 
 
 
    Page 5 of 11 
 
which was described as “Camera Stand (Zhiyun Crane 2 
Model CRA02)”. He submitted that the hardware and software 
for both Items were different.  The appellant submitted a 
detailed technical letter dated 12th December 2017 issued by 
the manufacturer, which indicates that the first item was of 
an unpopular brand with a lower version.  Regarding Item 
No.2 of Camera Stand (3 Axis Stabilizer - CRA01, Unpopular 
Brand), he submitted that it could not be compared with 
earlier Items imported by the appellant with a Bill of Entry 
dated 13th November 2017.  The Item was a “Camera Stand 
(Zhiyun Crane, Type Monopod)”.  He submitted that the 
features of both Items were completely different, as can be 
seen from the table reproduced by the adjudicating authority 
in order-in-original.  As regards Item no.3 of [Dual handle 
(Unpopular Brand), parts of Camera Stand], he submitted 
that same was sought to be compared with a completely 
different Item imported by the appellant with a Bill of Entry 
dated 13th November 2017, which was described as “Dual 
Handle for Camera Stand (for Zhiyun Crane)”.  He would, 
therefore, urge that, as found by the Commissioner (Appeals), 
the earlier goods imported by the appellant were neither 
identical nor similar goods.  He would, therefore, submit that 
CESTAT committed an error by interfering with the judgment 
and order of the Commissioner (Appeals).  
6. 
The learned ASG appearing for the respondent - 
Revenue pointed out that under sub-section (2) of Section 
129A 
for 
exercising 
power 
by 
the 
Committee 
of 

 
 
 
Civil Appeal no.9385 of 2022 
 
 
 
    Page 6 of 11 
 
Commissioners, no time limit was incorporated in the 
Customs Act.   However, under Section 129D, which deals 
with orders passed by the original authority, for a similar 
exercise to be done by the Committee of Commissioners, a 
limitation of 30 days has been prescribed.   He submitted that 
the judgment and order of the Commissioner (Appeals) was 
passed on 17th December 2020, and the order under sub-
section (2) of Section 129A was made on 2nd November 2021.  
He submitted that those were the days of the COVID-19 
pandemic, and the orders passed by this Court in the exercise 
of suo motu powers of extending limitations were in force at 
that time.  Learned ASG invited our attention to the fact that 
under the Bill of Entry subject matter of the appeal, the goods 
were shown as “unpopular models”.  He submitted that there 
was no explanation as to why, within a few months, the goods 
had become unpopular.  He pointed out that though later on, 
the importer claimed that the goods imported were of low 
versions compared to the earlier goods, the market survey 
showed that there were no such low versions in the market.  
He invited our attention to the comparison of features of the 
goods imported under the subject Bill of Entry and the earlier 
imports.  He submitted that, as regards all three Items, the 
earlier imported Items were more or less the same. The 
manufacturer has described the goods subject matter of the 
impugned Bill of Entry as an unpopular brand.  He submitted 
that in the order-in-original, the adjudicating authority had 
recorded a finding of fact that Item nos. 1 and 3 imported by 
the appellant were identical and Item no.2 was of similar 

 
 
 
Civil Appeal no.9385 of 2022 
 
 
 
    Page 7 of 11 
 
goods.  The goods in Item no.3 were identical to the goods 
earlier imported.  He submitted that the said finding of fact 
has been reaffirmed by the CESTAT, and therefore, no 
interference is called for.  
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS 
7. 
We have considered the submissions made across the 
Bar.  We also perused the submissions in “brief”, running into 
35 pages filed by the appellant before the CESTAT.  The first 
issue is of the bar of limitation in the exercise of powers under 
sub-section (2) of Section 129A. Sub-section (2) incorporates 
the powers of the Committee of Commissioners of Customs.  If 
the said Committee is of the opinion that an order passed by 
the Appellate Commissioner of Customs or Commissioner of 
Customs (Appeals) under Section 128 or 128A of the Customs 
Act is not legal and proper, it can direct the appropriate 
officer to file an appeal before the CESTAT.  On plain reading 
of Section 129A, we find that no specific time period has been 
prescribed for the Committee of Commissioners to exercise 
the power under sub-section (2) of Section 129A.  Section 
129D of the Customs Act deals with similar powers of the 
Committee of Commissioners when orders are passed by the 
Principal 
Commissioners 
of 
Customs 
as 
adjudicating 
authority.  There is a similar power to direct the proper officer 
to apply to the Appellate Tribunal.  However, sub-section (3) 
of Section 129D imposes a specific limitation of three months 
from the date of communication of the order of the 
adjudicating authority.  Thus, there is no prescribed period of 

 
 
 
Civil Appeal no.9385 of 2022 
 
 
 
    Page 8 of 11 
 
limitation for passing an order in exercise of the power under 
sub-section (2) of Section 129A.  It is true that even if the law 
does not provide for a specific period for taking a particular 
action, the authority vested with the power to take action 
must take the action within a reasonable time.  In the present 
case, the relevant period of 10 months is covered by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. During the said period, in suo motu RE: 
COGNIZANCE FOR EXTENSION OF LIMITATION, this Court, 
on 23rd September 2021, while disposing of Miscellaneous 
Application No.665 of 2021, extended the period of limitation 
provided under the statutes.  In the facts of the case, 
considering the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, it cannot 
be said that the Committee of Commissioners has taken an 
unreasonably 
long 
time 
to 
decide. 
 
Considering 
the 
extraordinary circumstances prevailing in those days due to 
COVID-19, the decision was taken within a reasonable time. 
The Committee took the decision on 2nd November 2021, 
which was received by the Deputy Commissioner (Review) on 
11th November 2021, and the appeal was preferred on 17th 
November 2021. It is true that under Sub-Section (3) of 
Section 129A, a period of limitation of 3 months has been 
provided for preferring an appeal which commences on the 
day on which the order sought to be appealed against is 
communicated to the concerned Authority. But, even the said 
period stood extended in view of the orders this Court passed 
from time to time in suo motu proceedings.

8. 
The issue of undervaluation has been discussed in 
detail in a decision of this Court in the case of Commissioner 
of Central Excise and Service Tax, Noida v. Sanjivani 
Non-ferrous Trading Pvt. Ltd.1. Paragraph 10 of the said 
decision reads thus:- 
“10. The law, thus, is clear. As per 
Sections 14(1) and 14(1-A), the value of 
any goods chargeable to ad valorem 
duty is deemed to be the price as 
referred to in that provision. Section 
14(1) is a deeming provision as it talks 
of “deemed value” of such goods. 
Therefore, 
normally, 
the 
assessing 
officer is supposed to act on the basis of 
price which is actually paid and treat 
the 
same 
as 
assessable 
value/transaction value of the goods. 
This, ordinarily, is the course of action 
which needs to be followed by the 
assessing 
officer. 
This 
principle 
of 
arriving at transaction value to be the 
assessable value applies. That is also 
the effect of Rule 3(1) and Rule 4(1) of 
the Customs Valuation Rules, namely, 
the adjudicating authority is bound to 
accept price actually paid or payable for 
goods 
as 
the 
transaction 
value. 
Exceptions are, however, carved out 
and enumerated in Rule 4(2). As per 
that provision, the transaction value 
mentioned in the bills of entry can be 
discarded in case it is found that 
 
1 (2019) 2 SCC 378 

 
 
 
Civil Appeal no.9385 of 2022 
 
 
 
    Page 10 of 11 
 
there are any imports of identical 
goods or similar goods at a higher 
price at around the same time or if 
the buyers and sellers are related to 
each other. In order to invoke such a 
provision it is incumbent upon the 
assessing officer to give reasons as to 
why the transaction value declared in 
the bills of entry was being rejected; 
to establish that the price is not the 
sole consideration; and to give the 
reasons supported by material on the 
basis of which the assessing officer 
arrives at his own assessable value.” 
  
 
 
    (emphasis supplied) 
In paragraph 19 of the impugned judgment, a comparative 
table of the goods subject matter of this appeal imported by 
the appellant and the goods imported by the appellant earlier 
has 
been 
incorporated. 
After 
due 
consideration, 
the 
adjudicating authority and CESTAT found the goods identical 
to/similar to the ones imported earlier. We have perused the 
said table. We find that except for the description as an 
“unpopular 
brand,” 
the 
products 
appear 
to 
be 
identical/similar. In any case, the factual finding rendered by 
CESTAT is after a detailed consideration of the material on 
record.   
9. 
At this stage, we may also make a note of the statement 
made by an officer of the appellant during the inquiry before 
the adjudicating authority.  In paragraph 11, he stated that 
there is a little difference in the hardware and software 

 
 
 
Civil Appeal no.9385 of 2022 
 
 
 
    Page 11 of 11 
 
functions in the disputed goods as compared to the earlier 
versions.  In the order-in-original and in the impugned 
judgment of CESTAT on facts, it was found that Item nos. 1 
and 3 were identical goods, and Item no. 2 was of similar 
goods.  Detailed reasons have been recorded in the order-in-
original as to why the transaction value of the imported goods 
has been discarded.  Cogent reasons have been assigned to 
arrive at the assessable value. 
10. Hence, in view of the findings recorded by the CESTAT, 
we find no error in the view taken.  No fault can be found with 
the imposition of penalties.  Hence, there is no merit in the 
appeal and the same is dismissed with no order as to costs.
