and conditions including costs. It is time to 
check with firmness such litigation initiated and 
laced with concealment, falsehood, and forum 
hunting. Even State actions or conduct of 
government servants being party to such 
malicious 
litigation 
should 
be 
seriously 
reprimanded. In the instant case, we find 
initiation of criminal proceedings before a forum 
which 
had 
no 
territorial 
jurisdiction 
by 
submitting incorrect facts and giving frivolous 
reasons to entertain such complaints. A closer 
look at the respondent’s actions reveals more 
than just an inappropriate use of jurisdiction. 
The core issue of the dispute, which involves 
financial transactions and agreements, clearly 
places it in the realm of civil and commercial 
law. Yet, the respondent chose to pursue 
criminal charges in a quest to abuse the 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 3 of 33 
 
criminal justice system with a motive to seek 
personal vengeance rather than seeking true 
justice. This unnecessary turning of a civil 
matter 
into 
a 
criminal 
case 
not 
only 
overburdens the criminal justice system but 
also violates the principles of fairness and right 
conduct in legal matters. The apparent misuse 
of criminal proceedings in this case not only 
damages trust in our legal system but also sets 
a harmful precedent if not addressed.

FACTUAL MATRIX – 
4. 
Karan Gambhir, who owns M/s D.D. Global 
Capital Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ‘the 
Company’) is the complainant in the FIR4 which 
was registered against Sushil Gupta, Rajesh 
Gupta, Dinesh Gupta, Baljeet Singh & others. 
Three private limited companies had also been 
arrayed as accused i.e. BDR5, Gulab Buildtech6 
and Verma Buildtech7.  The individuals, 
namely, Sushil Gupta, Rajesh Gupta and 
Dinesh Gupta are stated to be the promoters of 
the aforesaid three companies. 
5. 
Only two of the accused persons, i.e. Dinesh 
Gupta and Rajesh Gupta approached the High 
 
4 FIR No.1271 of 2018 dated 29.07.2018 registered at Gautam Budh Nagar Police Station, 
NOIDA 
5  M/s BDR Builders and Developers Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ‘BDR’) 
6 M/s Gulab Buildtech Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ‘Gulab Buildtech’) 
7 M/s Verma Buildtech and Promoters Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ‘Verma 
Buildtech’) 
 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc.

Court seeking quashing of the summoning 
order and the FIR.  Nothing was pointed out at 
the time of hearing that any matter filed by any 
other accused is pending either in this Court or 
High Court. 
6. 
It is alleged by the complainant that his 
company was induced to extend short-term 
loans of ₹ 5,16,00,000/- to Gulab Buildtech and 
₹ 
11,29,50,000/- 
to 
Verma 
Buildtech 
respectively.  Later, the said loan was converted 
into debt equity allegedly promising high 
returns from real estate business to the 
complainant.  The shares were allotted at an 
exorbitant price.  The complainant acquired 
21% shareholding in Verma Buildtech, whereas, 
in Gulab Buildtech, the shareholding was to the 
tune of 4.53%.  A share pledge agreement was 
forged, allegedly to have been executed in favour 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 6 of 33 
 
of Sushil Gupta, one of the accused (not before 
this Court). Some scheme of amalgamation was 
made by Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech 
to amalgamate the aforesaid companies with 
BDR, as a result of which, the percentage of 
shareholding 
of 
the 
company 
reduced 
considerably.  No notice was served on the 
company of the proposed amalgamation.  The 
amalgamation was got approved from the Delhi 
High Court. The share certificates were allegedly 
never 
physically 
handed 
over 
to 
the 
complainant.  
7. 
The complainant further alleged that when he 
asked the accused to return the loan with 
interest, initially time was sought stating that 
there is slump in the real estate market and 
thereafter, the accused started ignoring the 
complainant.  That is when the complainant 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 7 of 33 
 
decided to take legal recourse against the 
accused.   Prayer was made in the police 
complaint for registration of a case of cheating 
and forgery against the accused.  While filing 
the complaint, the complainant had given his 
address as ‘C/o A & A Earth Movers, D-9, 
Sector-2, Noida Sector-20, Gautam Budh 
Nagar, U.P.’ 
8. 
After investigation, the police found that a case 
was made out against the accused under 
Sections 420, 467 and 120-B of the IPC. A 
charge-sheet 
was 
filed 
on 
29.12.2020. 
Accordingly, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, 
Gautam 
Budh 
Nagar, 
vide 
order 
dated 
15.02.2021 
took 
cognizance 
and 
issued 
summons to the accused. 
9. 
The appellants filed petitions under Section 482 
of the Cr.P.C. before the High Court seeking 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 8 of 33 
 
quashing of the FIR and the summoning order 
dated 15.02.2021. The petitions having been 
dismissed by the composite order passed by the 
High Court, the same are under challenge in the 
present appeals. 
ARGUMENTS OF THE APPELLANTS – 
10. Mr. Kapil Sibal, Mr. Nakul Dewan and Ms. 
Anjana Prakash, learned senior counsels for the 
appellants submitted that the complainant who 
owns 
the 
company 
invested 
a 
sum 
of 
₹5,16,00,000/- 
in 
Gulab 
Buildtech 
and 
₹11,29,50,000/- 
in 
Verma 
Buildtech 
by 
acquiring equity shares thereof.  Prior to the 
investment, a resolution was passed by the 
company in the meeting of the Board of 
Directors 
held 
on 
25.03.2011, 
approving 
investment of ₹11,29,50,000/- in the equity 
shares of Verma Buildtech. Similarly, by a 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 9 of 33 
 
resolution dated 26.08.2011, investment in the 
equity shares of ₹5,16,00,000/- was approved 
in Gulab Buildtech.  Hence, the complainant’s 
case that it was a short-term loan given by the 
company, was totally contrary to the record 
since a conscious decision had been taken by 
the company to make investments in the equity 
shares 
of 
Gulab 
Buildtech 
and 
Verma 
Buildtech. The above two resolutions are 
reproduced hereunder: 
First Resolution: 
“AUTHORIZATION TO INVEST INTO 
THE EQUITY SHARES OF M/S VERMA 
BUILDTECH & PROMOTORS PRIVATE 
LTD.  
 
The Chairman apprised the Board of 
Directors of the Company about the 
benefit of investment into the equity 
shares of M/s Verma Buildtech & 
Promoters Private Ltd offered by way of 
private 
placement. 
The 
Directors 
discussed about the same at length and 
the following resolutions were passed. 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 10 of 33 
 
 
"RESOLVED THAT the company be and 
is herewith authorized to make an 
investment of Rupees Eleven Crore 
Twenty Nine Lacs and Fifty Thousand 
only (Rs.11,29,50,000/-) in pursuance 
of the provision of the companies Act, 
1956."  
 
"RESOLVED 
FURTHER 
THAT 
Mr. 
Narender Kumar and Mr. Tarun Kumar 
Director of the company be and are 
hereby severally authorized to do the 
necessary act including the signing of 
the documents, deed and agreement 
and other necessary paper which are 
incidental and consequential to give 
effect to the above said resolution and 
collect the Share certificates." 
Second Resolution: 
AUTHORIZATION TO INVEST INTO THE 
EQUITY SHARES OF M/S GULAB 
BUILDTECH PRIVATE LIMITED.  
 
The Chairman apprised the Board of 
Directors of the Company about the 
benefit of investment into the equity 
shares of M/S GULAB BUILDTECH 
PRIVATE LIMITED offered by way of 
private 
placement. 
The 
Directors 
discussed about the same at length and 
the following resolutions were passed.  
 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 11 of 33 
 
"RESOLVED THAT the company be and 
is herewith authorized to make an 
investment of Rupees Five Crores 
Sixteen Lacs only (Rs.5, 16,00,000/-) in 
pursuance of the provision of the 
companies Act, 1956."  
 
"RESOLVED 
FURTHER 
THAT 
Mr. 
Narender Kumar and Mr. Tarun Kumar 
Director of the company be and are 
hereby severally authorized to do the 
necessary act including the signing of 
the documents, deed and agreement 
and other necessary paper which are 
incidental and consequential to give 
effect to the above said resolution and 
collect the Share certificates." 
 
11. In 2012, when the petition8 was filed seeking 
amalgamation of Gulab Buildtech and Verma 
Buildtech with BDR, the Delhi High Court, as 
per requirements, had issued notice to all the 
shareholders 
of 
the 
two 
companies 
on                         
09.07.2012.  No objection was raised by the 
complainant or the company at that stage.  On 
20.02.2013, the scheme of amalgamation was 
 
8 Company Petition No.287 of 2012 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 12 of 33 
 
approved by the Delhi High Court in terms of 
which the company became entitled to 3,74,280 
shares of BDR.  On 08.03.2013, a letter was 
written 
by 
Gulab 
Buildtech 
and 
Verma 
Buildtech to the complainant to surrender 
original share certificates of Gulab Buildtech 
and Verma Buildtech to facilitate issuance of 
new certificates.   
12. Nearly one year after the amalgamation, on 
31.01.2014, DD Global Capital Limited, the 
company 
of 
the 
complainant 
filed 
an 
application9 before the Delhi High Court seeking 
recall of the order of amalgamation passed by 
the High Court as it was without any notice to 
the company.  Other grounds were also raised 
in this application for recalling the order of 
amalgamation. The aforesaid application was 
 
9 Company Application No.321 of 2014                                                                                                                                           

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 13 of 33 
 
dismissed by the High Court on 15.03.2016 by 
a detailed order dealing with all the issues 
raised.  The order attained finality as the 
company did not challenge the same any 
further.  In the aforesaid proceedings, a letter 
dated 08.10.2014, allegedly written by Sushil 
Gupta, one of the accused (not before this 
Court), claiming that the shares of the company 
with Verma Buildtech were pledged to him, was 
also placed on record.  This issue was also dealt 
with by the High Court.   
13. More than two years after the application filed 
by the company was dismissed by Delhi High 
Court, the instant complaint was filed with the 
police at Gautam Budh Nagar, on the basis of 
which FIR in question was registered on 
29.07.2018. 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 14 of 33 
 
14. It is the appellants’ submission that a purely 
civil 
dispute 
with 
reference 
to 
financial 
transactions between corporates is sought to be 
given colour of a criminal case.  Though the 
company does not have any connection 
whatsoever with Gautam Budh Nagar and all 
the transactions were held at New Delhi 
between the parties, which are based in New 
Delhi, yet the complaint was filed at Gautam 
Budh Nagar.  Even the address of the 
complainant given in the complaint is ‘C/o A & 
A Earth Movers, D-9, Sector-2, Noida Sector-20, 
Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P.’  which neither 
belongs to the complainant nor his company.  
The aforesaid facts clearly establish that the 
idea was only to harass the appellants.   
15. In fact, the dispute amongst the parties has 
already been referred to Arbitration by the Delhi 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 15 of 33 
 
High Court vide order dated 15.05.2019 and the 
company has already filed its claim before the 
sole Arbitrator. 
16. The aforesaid facts clearly establish that no case 
was made out against the appellants.  Further, 
there is no allegation pertaining to forging of any 
documents against them.  It was a simple 
business transaction.  Arm-twisting method to 
recover any dues cannot be permitted to be 
used.  In support of the appellants’ arguments, 
reliance was placed on the judgment of this 
Court in Randheer Singh v. The State of U.P. 
& others10. 
17. It was submitted that there was total non-
application of mind by the Trial court while 
passing summoning order, which is entirely 
non-speaking in nature.  Even the High Court 
 
10 2021 INSC 440: (2021) 14 SCC 626. 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 16 of 33 
 
failed to consider the arguments raised by the 
appellants. 
 
ARGUMENTS 
OF 
THE 
RESPONDENT 
–
COMPLAINANT 
18. On the other hand, Mr. Vikas Singh, learned 
senior counsel for the respondent-complainant, 
submitted that solely on persuasion of the 
accused, huge amount of short-term loan was 
advanced.  Subsequently, shares were allotted, 
which 
were 
never 
handed 
over 
to 
the 
complainant.  The companies whose shares 
were allotted, namely, Gulab Buildtech and 
Verma Buildtech were amalgamated with BDR.  
During the process of amalgamation, despite 
being a shareholder, the complainant was not 
issued any notice.  As a result of amalgamation, 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 17 of 33 
 
the percentage of shareholding of the company 
was reduced considerably.   
19. The letter conveying that the company had 
pledged its shares to Sushil Gupta shows that 
certain documents had been forged.  He further 
referred to the order dated 20.02.2013 passed 
by the High Court in Co. Pet. No. 287 of 2012, 
showing 
that 
the 
accused 
persons 
are 
connected with each other.  He also referred to 
the Balance Sheet of Gulab Buildtech and 
Verma Buildtech to show that the amount 
advanced by the complainant was shown in the 
column 
of 
‘current 
liabilities’. 
 
Indian 
Accounting Standards have been referred to 
show the meaning of ‘current liabilities’ which is 
in the form of short-term loan.   
20. The argument is that the accused persons in 
connivance with each other have cheated the 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 18 of 33 
 
complainant for crores of rupees by making 
false promise of higher returns.  There is no 
error in the order passed by the High Court.  The 
appeals deserve to be dismissed. 
FINDINGS – 
21. We have heard learned counsel for the parties 
and perused the material on record. 
22. On a complaint filed by the respondent no.2, 
FIR in question was registered on 29.07.2018.  
The address of the company D.D. Global was 
mentioned as ‘C/o A & A Earth Movers, D-9, 
Sector-2, Noida Sector-20, Gautam Budh 
Nagar, U.P.’ to be the present as well as the 
permanent address.  This is the first misleading 
statement made by the complainant. From a 
copy of the resolution passed by the DD Global 
dated 25.03.2011, it is evident that the 
registered office of the DD Global is located at F-

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 19 of 33 
 
1/9, Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-I, New Delhi.  
Even at the time of hearing, it remained 
undisputed that DD Global is not carrying on 
any business at Noida, nor has it rented the 
place mentioned above. Further, the firm ‘A & A 
Earth Movers’ whose c/o address has been 
given is not the sister concern of DD Global.   
23. Similar was the case with reference to the 
accused nos. 2 & 3, namely, Rajesh Gupta and 
Dinesh Gupta, appellants before this Court. 
Their 
incomplete 
addresses 
have 
been 
mentioned reflecting them to be the residents of 
Sector 20, Gautam Budh Nagar. The position is 
same in the case of Gulab Buildtech and Verma 
Buildtech. 
Though 
the 
complainant 
had 
invested crores of rupees in equity of the 
aforesaid two companies based at New Delhi, 
knowing well their place of business, yet in 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 20 of 33 
 
those cases, incomplete addresses showing 
them at Sector 20, Gautam Budh Nagar, was 
deliberately mentioned. It is sufficiently clear 
that the idea was to falsely create jurisdiction in 
Gautam Budh Nagar which did not actually lie 
there. 
24. The falsehood in the complaint, filed with 
reference to the addresses of the accused, was 
established at the time of filing of charge-sheet. 
Whereas in the FIR, the addresses of all the 
accused 
given 
were 
incomplete 
merely 
mentioning the address as ‘Sector 20, Gautam 
Budh Nagar’, in the charge-sheet addresses of 
not only the appellants, namely, Rajesh Gupta 
and Dinesh Gupta, were found to be ‘D-393, 
New Friends Colony, New Delhi, even Sushil 
Gupta and Baljeet Singh were also found to be 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc.

25. Though address of Karan Gambhir who was 
signatory of the complaint on the basis of FIR in 
question registered, was mentioned to be of 
Noida, same as was given in the complaint.  
However, his residential address was not given.  

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 23 of 33 
 
His parentage was also not mentioned.  The 
second person shown in the chargesheet is a 
supporting witness, Sanjay Gambhir, who has 
shown his present and permanent address of 
‘P.S. Hauz Khas, N-58, Panchsheel Marg, New 
Delhi’.  The same is the position with reference 
to Tarun Gambhir, who also is claimed to be a 
supporting witness.  All other witnesses were 
officials who were involved in the investigation 
of the case.    
26. The Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gautam Budh 
Nagar, vide order dated 15.02.2021 took 
cognizance thereof and issued summons to the 
accused. The order shows no application of 
mind, as no reasons have been assigned. The 
Magistrate also did not take into consideration 
the address of the complainant and the accused 
companies as also the addresses of their 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 24 of 33 
 
Directors. 
There 
was 
complete 
lack 
of 
application of mind while taking cognizance and 
issuing summons. 
27. Coming to the allegation of the complainant 
being misled for advancing loan, which was 
later on converted into equity, the appellants 
placed 
on 
record 
two 
resolutions 
dated 
25.03.2011 and 26.08.2011 passed by the 
company vide which decision was taken by the 
complainant to invest in the equity of Gulab 
Buildtech and Verma Buildtech to the tune of 
₹5,16,00,000/- 
and 
₹ 
11,29,50,000/- 
respectively.  The said resolutions passed by the 
complainant have not been denied. Hence, the 
claim that the appellants had induced the 
complainant to advance loan and later on 
converted the loan into equity, is totally false. It 
was rather a deliberate decision taken by the 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 25 of 33 
 
Board founded on above-mentioned company 
resolutions.   
28. Further, it is apparent that the complainant had 
concealed material facts which were within his 
knowledge at the time of filing of complaint. 
These facts pertained to the complainant’s 
knowledge of the merger of Gulab Buildtech and 
Verma Buildtech with BDR, details whereof are 
noted hereinafter.  
29. A Company Petition No.287 of 2012 was filed in 
the High Court for merger of the Gulab 
Buildtech and Verma Buildtech with BDR. As 
required, due notice was issued to all the 
concerned stake holders including all the 
shareholders and creditors.  The same was 
published in the newspapers also.  The 
complainant neither raised any objection nor 
appeared before the High Court.  After 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 26 of 33 
 
considering the material placed on record, the 
High Court allowed the merger application on 
20.02.2013, as a result of which Gulab 
Buildtech and Verma Buildtech were merged 
into BDR.  Nearly, one year thereafter on 
31.01.2014, the complainant company filed a 
Company Application No. 321 of 2014 for recall 
of the order dated 20.02.2013.  The grievance 
raised was that the order of merger was passed 
without notice to the company, which held 
substantial percentage of shares in both the 
companies.  The aforesaid application was 
dismissed by the High Court vide order dated 
15.03.2016.  The same was not challenged by 
the company any further and, hence, attained 
finality.   
30. It would be relevant to note that in the 
application filed for recall of the merger order by 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 27 of 33 
 
the complainant, it was nowhere mentioned 
that initially the complainant had advanced 
loan, which was later on converted into debt 
equity.  It only mentioned that the complainant 
was a shareholder of the transferor company 
and as a result of merger their percentage of 
shareholding and value of shares decreased.  It 
was also nowhere pleaded in the application 
that the shares held by the company were 
mortgaged to Sushil Gupta by forging the 
documents.  The new story of forging documents 
was built up in the complaint filed with the 
police only to give a criminal colour which 
actually was commercial in nature. 
31. Not 
only 
this, 
despite 
dismissal 
of 
the 
application filed by the complainant for recall of 
the merger order by the High Court  vide order 
dated 15.03.2016, in the complaint made to the 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 28 of 33 
 
police on 29.07.2018 i.e. more than two years 
and four months later, still the complainant did 
not furnish complete details thereof, especially 
the filing and dismissal of the application for 
recall of the merger order. Rather, it merely 
stated that he got the documents from the  High 
Court 
which 
were 
filed 
along 
with 
the 
amalgamation application and came to know 
about certain facts therefrom but did not 
mention about the application filed for recall of 
the order of amalgamation and the result 
thereof.  Non-disclosure of such relevant facts 
was a deliberate and mischievous attempt on 
the part of the complainant to maliciously 
initiate 
criminal 
proceedings 
for 
ulterior 
motives. 
32. Most importantly, it needs to be noticed that it 
was a plain and simple transaction between the 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 29 of 33 
 
corporates.  Even as per the complainant’s case, 
the short-term loan was advanced in the year 
2010 for a period of one year.  However, when 
the same was not returned, no steps were taken 
by the complainant to recover the same until the 
FIR in question was registered on 29.07.2018 
i.e. 8 years & 7 months later.   
33. Further, the complainant came to know about 
the merger of the Gulab Buildtech and Verma 
Buildtech with BDR in the year 2013 itself.  
However, even after dismissal of the application 
filed for recall of the merger order passed by the 
High Court on 15.03.2016, no steps were taken 
to recover the amount, except getting the FIR 
registered more than two years later.  All these 
facts clearly reflect upon the ill designs of the 
complainant. 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 30 of 33 
 
34. The entire factual matrix and the time lines 
clearly reflects that the complainant deliberately 
and unnecessarily has caused substantial delay 
and had been waiting for opportune moment for 
initiating false and frivolous litigation. 
35. Further, it has been noticed by the High Court 
in the impugned order that on an application 
filed by the appellants, an Arbitrator was 
appointed by the Delhi High Court vide order 
dated 15.05.2019 to settle the dispute amongst 
the parties and the said matter was still 
pending.  
36. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we find that 
the FIR in question, if proceeded further, will 
result in absolute abuse of process of court.  It 
is a clear case of malicious prosecution. Hence, 
the same is required to be quashed. 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 31 of 33 
 
37. The appeals are accordingly allowed.  The 
impugned order passed by the High Court is set 
aside.  FIR No.1271 of 2018 dated 29.07.2018 
registered with Gautam Budh Nagar Police 
Station, Noida, and all subsequent proceedings 
thereof qua the appellants are quashed.  
38. Before parting with the judgement, we are 
reminded 
of 
the 
opening 
remarks. 
The 
respondent Karan Gambhir having misused the 
legal system by lodging false and frivolous 
complaint with non-disclosure of necessary 
facts must bear its costs. The registration of FIR 
at Noida despite having registered offices of 
companies in question at Delhi shows a wishful 
forum shopping by the Complainant, casting 
serious doubts on their bona fides. The 
Complainant 
had 
already 
sought 
remedy 
against amalgamation order before the High 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc. 
    
Page 32 of 33 
 
Court and the High Court had dismissed the 
same. However, Complainant chose to again use 
judicial mechanisms to raise his grievances. A 
criminal complaint was filed and FIR was 
registered 
against 
appellants 
despite 
the 
commercial nature of dispute. Such ill intended 
acts of abuse of power and of legal machinery 
seriously affect the public trust in judicial 
functioning. 
Thus, 
we 
find 
ourselves 
constrained to impose cost on Complainant with 
a view to curb others from such acts leading to 
abuse of judicial remedies. 
   
39. Considering the above facts and circumstances 
of the case, we impose costs of ₹25 lakhs on the 
respondent Karan Gambhir to be deposited 
within four weeks from today with the Registry 
of this Court. Upon receipt of the said amount, 
the same will be transmitted in equal amount to 

S.L.P.(Crl.) No.3343 of 2022 etc.

the SCBA & SCAORA to be utilised for the 
development and benefit of their members.
