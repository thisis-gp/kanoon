O R D E R 
 
1. 
The State of Meghalaya filed the captioned Special Leave Petition 
challenging the order dated 29.09.2023 passed in Bail Application No. 38/2023 
by the High Court of Meghalaya at Shillong. 
2. 
FIR No.06(02)23 was registered against the respondent-accused (Smt. X) on 
08.02.2023 for offences under Sections 21(c)/29 of the Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (for short ‘NDPS Act’). Anonymization as 
relates the identity of the respondent-accused as ‘Smt.X’ has been done, as she is 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive. Virtually, from 16.03.2023 
onwards, Smt. X was in judicial custody in connection with the crime bearing FIR 
No.22(03)2023 registered at Khliehriat Police Station under Sections 21(c)/29 of 
the NDPS Act and her formal arrest in the subject Crime was recorded on 
11.04.2023 during such custody.  While so, as per the order dated 27.06.2023, the 
High Court of Meghalaya at Shillong granted bail in connection with FIR 
No.22(03)2023 on the solitary ground of her being HIV positive.

3. 
It is the subsequent grant of bail on 29.09.2023 in connection with FIR 
No.06(02)23, sans satisfactory consideration of the twin conditions under Section 
37(1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act that constrained the State to approach this Court with 
the captioned Special Leave Petition.  As a matter of fact, the bail application that 
culminated in the said order dated 29.09.2023 was moved by the son of the 
accused-Smt.X, on her behalf.  
 
4. 
Heard learned Advocate General Shri Amit Kumar for the State of 
Meghalaya.  Earlier, notice was issued to the respondents and despite being 
served respondent No.1, the son of Smt. X, through whom B.A.  No.38/2023 which 
culminated in the impugned order was moved, did not enter appearance.  Later, 
bailable warrant was issued against the Smt.X.  The report annexed to the office 
report would reveal that bailable warrant was executed on 02.07.2024 and Smt.X 
was released on bail with the instructions to appear before this Court on 
16.07.2024 at 10.30 a.m.  However, the respondent-accused failed to appear 
before the Court when this matter was taken up for consideration.  In this context, 
it is to be noted that in the order impugned dated 29.09.2023, whereby Smt. X 
was granted bail, itself one of the conditions is that she should co-operate with 
the process of the court concerned.  Be that as it may, we will now proceed to 
consider the challenge against the order dated 29.09.2023. 
 
 
 
5. 
There cannot be any doubt with respect to the position that in cases 
involving commercial quantity of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances, 
while considering the application of bail, the Court is bound to ensure the 

Page 3 of 7 
 
satisfaction of conditions under Section 37(1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act.  The said 
provision reads thus: - 
 
“37(1)(b)(ii)- where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the 
court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he 
is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence 
while on bail.” 
 
6. 
While considering the cases under NDPS Act, one cannot be oblivious of 
the objects and reasons for bringing the said enactment after repealing the then 
existing laws relating to the Narcotic drugs.  The object and reasons given in the 
acts itself reads thus: -  
“An act to consolidate and amend the law relating to narcotic drugs, to 
make stringent provisions for the control and regulation of operations 
relating to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, to provide for the 
forfeiture of property derived from, or used in, illicit traffic in narcotic 
drugs and psychotropic substances, to implement the provisions of the 
International Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 
and for matters connected therewith." 
 
In the decision in Collector of Customs, New Delhi v. Ahmadalieva 
Nodira1, the three judge bench of this Court considered the provisions under 
Section 37(1)(b) as also 37(1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act, with regard to the 
expression “reasonable grounds” used therein.  This Court held that it means 
something more than the prima facie grounds and that it contemplates substantial 
and probable causes for believing that the accused is not guilty of the alleged 
offence.  Furthermore, it was held that the reasonable belief contemplated in the 
 
1 (2004) 3 SCC 549 

Page 4 of 7 
 
provision would require existence of such facts and circumstances as are 
sufficient in themselves to justify satisfaction that the accused is not guilty of the 
alleged offence. 
As relates the twin conditions under Section 37(1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act, 
viz., that, firstly, there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is 
not guilty of such offence and, secondly, he is not likely to commit any offence 
while on bail it was held therein that they are cumulative and not alternative.  
Satisfaction of existence of those twin conditions had to be based on the 
‘reasonable grounds’, as referred above. 
 
7. 
In the decision in State of Kerala and Ors. v. Rajesh and Ors.2, after 
reiterating the broad parameters laid down by this Court to be followed while 
considering an application for bail moved by an accused involved in offences 
under the NDPS Act, in paragraph 18 thereof this Court held that the scheme of 
Section 37 of the NDPS Act would reveal that the exercise of power to grant bail 
in such cases is not only subject to the limitations contained under Section 439 of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure, but also subject to the limitation placed by 
Section 37(1)(b)(ii), NDPS Act.  Further it was held that in case one of the two 
conditions thereunder is not satisfied the ban for granting bail would operate. 
 
8. 
Thus, the provisions under Section 37(1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act and the 
decisions referred supra revealing the consistent view of this Court that while 
considering the application for bail made by an accused involved in an offence 
 
2 (2020) 12 SCC 122 

Page 5 of 7 
 
under NDPS Act a liberal approach ignoring the mandate under Section 37 of the 
NDPS Act is impermissible. Recording a finding mandated under Section 37 of 
the NDPS Act, which is sine qua non for granting bail to an accused under the 
NDPS Act cannot be avoided while passing orders on such applications. 
 
9. 
The materials on record would reveal that earlier Smt. X was enlarged on 
bail by the High Court as per order dated 27.06.2023 in connection with FIR 
No.22(03)2023, involving the quantity of 55.68 grams of Heroin, despite the 
opposition of the public prosecutor, taking note of her being HIV positive. In the 
said order it is stated thus: - 
“30. Accordingly, on this ground alone, the application for grant of bail is 
hereby allowed.” 
 
10. 
The subject FIR viz., FIR No. 06(02)23 under Section(s) 21(c)/29 of the NDPS 
Act, would reveal that the quantity of the contraband involved is 1.040 kgs of 
heroin.  The impugned order granting bail to accused-Smt. X, dated 29.09.2023 
would reveal, this time also, the bail was granted on the ground that she is 
suffering from HIV and conspicuously, without adverting to the mandate under 
Section 37(1)(b)(ii), NDPS Act, even after taking note of the fact that the rigour of 
Section 37, NDPS Act, calls for consideration in view of the involvement of 
commercial quantity of the contraband substance.  When the accused is involved 
in offences under Section 21(c)/29 of NDPS Act, more than one occasion and 
when the quantity of the contraband substance viz., heroin is 1.040 Kgs, much 
above the commercial quantity, then the non-consideration of the provisions 

Page 6 of 7 
 
under Section 37, NDPS Act, has to be taken as a very serious lapse.  In cases of 
like nature, granting bail solely on the ground mentioned, relying on the 
decision in Bhawani Singh v. State of Rajasthan3 would not only go against the 
spirit of the said decision but also would give a wrong message to the society that 
being a patient of such a disease is a license to indulge in such serious offences 
with impunity.  In the contextual situation it is to be noted that in Bhawani Singh’s 
case the offence(s) involved was not one under the NDPS Act. We have no 
hesitation to say that in the above circumstances it can only be held that the twin 
conditions under Section 37 of the NDPS Act, are not satisfied and on the sole 
reason that the accused is a HIV patient, cannot be a reason to enlarge her on 
bail.  Since the impugned order was passed without adhering to the said 
provision and in view of the rigour thereunder the accused-Smt.X is not entitled 
to be released on bail, the impugned order invites interference. 
 
11. 
Consequently, the impugned order is set aside. The accused-Smt.X shall 
surrender before the trial Court within a week from today and in case of her 
failure to do so, she shall be taken into custody in accordance with law.  Upon 
such surrender/production of the accused before the trial Court, it shall cancel 
the bail bond of the accused and discharge the sureties. 
 
12. 
In view of the indisputable fact that Smt. X is HIV positive she is entitled to 
the benefit under Section 34(2) of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus and 
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Act, 2017, 
 
3 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1991

which reads thus: - 
 
“34. ... 
... 
(2). In any legal proceeding concerning or relating to an HIV-positive 
person, the court shall take up and dispose of the proceeding on 
priority basis.” 
 
13. 
In view of the said provision the trial Court shall take appropriate steps to 
expedite the trial on priority basis and to dispose of the case as early as  
possible. 
 
14. 
The Special Leave Petition is disposed of, as above.  
 
15. 
Pending application(s), if any, stands disposed of.
