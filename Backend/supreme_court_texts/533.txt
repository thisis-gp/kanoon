respondents – directors of the company on whose 
account the dishonoured cheque was drawn. 
3. Appellant 
company 
entered 
into 
several 
Agreements and Sale Orders with one Cane Agro 
Energy (India) Ltd. (Cane hereinafter) between 
September 2016 and June 2017. Under these 
Agreements and Sale Orders, the appellant made 
advance 
payments 
amounting 
to 
Rs.63,46,00,000/- (Rupees sixty three crores forty 
six lakhs) for supply of sugar by Cane. It is alleged 
by the appellant that Cane failed to supply the 
ordered quantities of sugar and also failed to 
discharge its other obligations as agreed upon. 
Cane agreed to refund the advance amount due and 
payable to the Appellant. In part discharge of 
liability, a sum of Rs.1,00,00,000/- (Rupees one 
crore) was refunded by Cane on 30.01.2018. 
4. Subsequently, respondent Nos. 1 to 3 issued two 
cheques dated 30.03.2020 in favour of the 
appellant, one for Rs.45,00,00,000/- (Rupees forty 
five crores) and one for Rs.6,64,41,300/- (Rupees 
six crores sixty four lakhs forty one thousand and 
three hundred), amounting to a total amount of 
Rs.51,64,41,300/- (Rupees fifty one crores sixty 
four lakhs forty one thousand and three hundred). 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 3 of 22 
 
These two cheques were signed by respondent No.1, 
who is the Chairman of Cane. 
5. The said cheques were presented to the Bank but 
were dishonoured due to insufficiency of funds, 
vide return memos dated 02.06.2020. Appellant 
issued notice date 18.06.2020 to respondent Nos. 1 
to 3 against the dishonour of cheques demanding 
payment of dues. A notice was duly served on 
30.06.2020. When the payments due were not 
made, the appellant preferred a complaint before 
the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Kolhapur, 
which was registered as Summary Criminal Case 
No.2967 of 2020. On 11.08.2020, the Judicial 
Magistrate, First Class, Kolhapur issued process 
against respondent Nos. 1 to 3. In the meantime, 
Cane was admitted into Corporate Insolvency 
Resolution Process by order of National Company 
Law Tribunal, Mumbai. 
6. Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 entered appearance before 
the Judicial Magistrate and subsequently preferred 
an application under Section 258, Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 18602, seeking stoppage of proceedings 
in terms of the moratorium running against Cane. 
On 20.05.2021 an order imposing moratorium 
against Cane was passed under Section 14, 
 
2 CrPC 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 4 of 22 
 
Insolvency 
and 
Bankruptcy 
Code, 
20163. 
Respondent Nos. 1 to 3, along with Cane, preferred 
another application under Section 258, CrPC 
seeking stoppage of proceedings before the Judicial 
Magistrate. 
7. The Judicial Magistrate partly allowed the above 
application and held that the complaint shall not 
proceed against Cane in view of Section 14, IBC till 
the order of moratorium is operative; but the 
complaint was ordered to proceed ordinarily 
against respondent Nos.1 to 3 herein. The Judicial 
Magistrate observed that as per the scheme of 
Section 14, IBC the proceedings for offences 
punishable under Section 138, NI Act is withheld 
by order of moratorium only for corporate debtors 
and not against other natural persons arrayed as 
respondents in representative capacity for the 
accused company. 
8. Appellant filed an application under Section 143-A, 
NI Act against respondent Nos. 1 to 3 seeking 
interim compensation from the respondents during 
the pendency of the criminal proceedings before the 
Judicial Magistrate. Vide order dated 27.04.2022, 
the Judicial Magistrate directed each of the 
respondents to pay 4% of the total cheque amount 
 
3 IBC 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 5 of 22 
 
as interim compensation to the appellant within 60 
days. The respondents were granted an extension 
till 26.07.2022 to pay the interim compensation 
upon an application made by them. 
9. Appellant preferred an application under Section 
421, CrPC read with Section 143-A(5), NI Act 
seeking execution of order dated 27.04.2022 and 
thus recovery of interim compensation as if it were 
a fine. The respondents filed their response to the 
application, the same is pending before the Judicial 
Magistrate. 
10. Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 preferred Criminal 
Application No. 967 of 2022 before the High Court 
challenging the order of interim compensation 
dated 
27.04.2022 
passed 
by 
the 
Judicial 
Magistrate. The High Court, vide interim order 
dated 23.09.2022, stayed the operation of the order 
impugned therein. 
11. During the pendency of the above application, the 
High Court, in a batch of Writ Petitions and 
Criminal Application dealing with the same issue 
and the question of law that whether the signatory 
of the cheque, authorized by the "Company", is the 
"drawer" and whether such signatory could be 
directed to pay interim compensation in terms of 
section 143A, NI Act leaving aside the company, 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 6 of 22 
 
vide its final judgment and order dated 08.03.2023 
held that the signatory of the cheque is not a 
‘drawer’ in terms of Section 143-A, NI Act and 
cannot be directed to pay interim compensation 
under Section 143A. 
12. In light of the above judgment and order of the co-
ordinate bench in Criminal Application No. 886 of 
2022, the High Court vide order dated 29.03.2023, 
allowed the application preferred by the respondent 
Nos. 1 to 3 herein and set aside the order of interim 
compensation passed by the Judicial Magistrate on 
27.04.2022. 
13. The appellant has challenged the judgment and 
order of the High Court dated 29.03.2023 as well as 
the relied upon judgment and order dated 
08.03.2023. The present Appeal is filed assailing 
the correctness of these orders vis-à-vis the larger 
question of law, as framed by the High Court: 
“Whether the signatory of the cheque, 
authorized by the "Company", is the "drawer" 
and whether such signatory could be 
directed to pay interim compensation in 
terms of section 143A of the Negotiable 
Instruments Act, 1881 leaving aside the 
company?” 
14. The High Court, in its judgment dated 08.03.2023 
in Criminal Application No.886 of 2022, answered 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 7 of 22 
 
the above question in the negative and upheld the 
same in its order dated 29.03.2023 in the case of 
the appellant before us. To answer the question of 
law and determine the correctness of its view it is 
imperative to look into the considerations before 
the High Court and its analysis. 
OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THE HIGH COURT 
15. The High Court, while answering the above 
question 
in 
the 
negative, 
 
made 
several 
observations based on the interpretation of the 
relevant statutes under the NI Act as well as on the 
judgments relied upon by the counsels in their 
arguments before the High Court. 
15.1. Obligation of the Drawer of the Cheque 
The High Court observed that under Section 7 of 
the NI Act, the maker of a bill of exchange or cheque 
is termed the "drawer," and the person directed to 
pay is called the "drawee." The drawer is the 
individual who issues the cheque. Sections 138, 
143A, and 148 of the NI Act fall under Chapter XVII, 
which pertains to penalties for the dishonour of 
certain cheques due to insufficient funds. A plain 
reading of Section 138 highlights that the drawer 
must have an account with sufficient funds to cover 
the cheque. The primary liability under Section 138 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 8 of 22 
 
is on the drawer, who must ensure that there are 
adequate funds in the account at the time the 
cheque is presented. Additionally, the offence 
under Section 138 is not complete until a demand 
notice is served on the drawer, emphasizing the 
drawer's responsibility. The drawer is considered 
the principal offender if the cheque is returned 
unpaid, subject to the fulfilment of the necessary 
conditions 
before 
and 
after 
the 
cheque 
is 
dishonoured. 
 
15.2. General Rule of Criminal Liability 
The High Court noted the general rule against 
vicarious 
liability 
in 
criminal 
cases, 
where 
individuals are typically not held criminally liable 
for acts committed by others. However, this 
principle is subject to exceptions created by specific 
statutory provisions extending liability to additional 
parties. Section 141, NI Act is one such provision 
that extends criminal liability for dishonour of a 
cheque committed by a company to its officers. The 
Court emphasized that liability under Section 141 
arises from the conduct, act, or omission of the 
person involved, not merely their position in the 
company. The provision establishes vicarious 
liability for officers of the company, such as 
signatories of the cheque, managing directors, or 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 9 of 22 
 
those in charge of its affairs, by legal fiction. Thus, 
while the drawer of the cheque remains primarily 
liable, Section 141 broadens liability to include 
others associated with the company's management, 
ensuring accountability beyond the drawer alone. 
15.3. Authorised signatory cannot be equated to the 
company 
Further, the High Court delved into the distinction 
between legal entities and individuals acting as 
authorized signatories within the framework of the 
NI Act. The Court observed that while individuals 
may sign cheques as authorized representatives of 
companies, they do not assume legal identity of the 
company itself. It clarified that a legal entity, such 
as a corporation or company, is an artificial 
creation of the law endowed with rights, duties, and 
the capacity to sue and be sued independently of 
the individuals who manage or represent it. The 
Court emphasized that an authorized signatory, 
despite acting on behalf of a company, remains 
distinct as an individual under the law. This 
distinction is crucial as it clarifies that the actions 
and obligations undertaken by an authorized 
signatory are attributable to the company they 
represent, but do not merge their legal status with 
that of the company itself. Thus, while an 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 10 of 22 
 
authorized signatory may bind the company 
through their actions, they do not transform into a 
legal entity in the eyes of law. 
15.4. Interpretation of the Section 143-A and the 
legislative intent 
Moreover, the High Court highlighted the principle 
of statutory interpretation, particularly in relation 
to Sections 143A and 148 of the NI Act, which are 
under consideration. It discussed the dichotomy 
between interpreting statutes based on their plain 
language versus applying purposive construction. 
According to the Court, when the statutory 
language is clear and unambiguous, it speaks for 
itself, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
need 
for 
further 
interpretation. The natural and ordinary meaning 
of words should prevail unless the legal context 
necessitates a different interpretation to align with 
the legislative intent or to avoid absurd outcomes. 
15.4.1. The Court further elucidated that legislative intent 
should guide the interpretation of statutes, with all 
parts of a statute considered together to discern the 
overall purpose. It stressed that words and phrases 
within a statute must be construed in context, 
taking into account the legislative objectives and 
the broader framework of the law. This holistic 
approach ensures that statutory interpretation 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 11 of 22 
 
remains faithful to the lawmakers' intentions and 
avoids inconsistencies or injustices that may arise 
from a literal reading of isolated provisions. 
15.4.2. The High Court emphasized that Section 143A 
should be interpreted plainly, without resorting to 
other rules of interpretation. It asserted that the 
term 'drawer' in Section 143A has a clear and 
unambiguous meaning, referring specifically to the 
person who issues the cheque. Referring to the 
Statement of Objects and Purposes of the 
Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2018, 
the High Court noted that the purpose of Section 
143A is to provide interim relief to payees of 
dishonoured cheques by imposing liability on the 
drawer. This, according to the High Court, aligns 
with the legislative intent to curb frivolous 
litigations and expedite resolution of cheque 
dishonour cases. 
15.4.3. The High Court rejected the inclusion of 
authorized signatories within the definition of 
'drawer'. It pointed out that the legislature's choice 
of words in Section 143A specifically targets the 
drawer of the cheque, whether an individual or a 
company, and does not extend liability to 
authorized signatories. Drawing from established 
legal precedents, the High Court underscored that 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 12 of 22 
 
the term 'drawer' carries a specific legal meaning 
within the NI Act. It highlighted the cases where 
Courts consistently interpreted 'drawer' to refer 
strictly to the issuer of the cheque, reinforcing its 
decision to uphold this interpretation. The High 
Court relied on the following judgments to 
emphasise on the literal interpretation warranted 
in the present case: 
i. 
Nazir Ahmad v. King Emperor4 
ii. Central Bank of India v. Ravindra5  
iii. Noor Mohammed v. Khurram Pasha6 
15.4.4. Contextually, the High Court stressed upon the 
finding that 'drawer' within the framework of the NI 
Act consistently refers to the party issuing the 
cheque. It dismissed the arguments seeking to 
expand this definition to include authorized 
signatories, citing the need for consistency in 
statutory interpretation. 
15.4.5. The High Court also invoked principles of 
company law to support its interpretation. It 
affirms the separate legal identity of a company and 
its authorized signatories under the Companies 
 
4 AIR 1936 Privy Council 253 
5 (2002) 1 SCC 367 
6 (2022) 9 SCC 23 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 13 of 22 
 
Act, 
which 
prevents 
extending 
liability 
to 
signatories under Section 143A. 
16. In 
conclusion, 
the 
High 
Court's 
analysis 
underscores 
the 
critical 
distinction 
between 
individuals acting as authorized signatories and the 
legal entities they represent under the NI Act. 
17. Before we delve into the arguments presented by 
the counsels for the parties before us, it is 
imperative that we also look at the observations 
made by the High Court with respect to the two 
judgments heavily relied upon by the parties before 
it as well as before us. 
18. The High Court while addressing the reliance 
placed upon Aneeta Hada v. godfather travels 
and tours Pvt. Ltd.7 and N. Harihara Krishnan 
v. J. Thomas,8 observed that while Aneeta Hada 
(supra) underscored the necessity of involving the 
company as an accused to maintain a prosecution 
under Section 141 NI Act, N. Harihara Krishna 
(supra) clarified that an authorized signatory is not 
considered the "drawer" under Section 138 of the 
NI Act. These judgments guided the High Court in 
interpreting provisions of the NI Act regarding 
 
7 (2012) 5 SCC 661 
8 (2018) 13 SCC 663 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 14 of 22 
 
vicarious liability and the definition of the term 
"drawer" within the statutory framework. 
 
SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT 
19. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted 
that if a director, managing director, chairman, 
promotor of a company can be arrayed as accused 
under Section 141, NI Act despite not being a 
signatory to the cheque, then it is only fair that one 
or more of such individuals be held liable to pay 
interim compensation. 
20. Relying upon the object of Section 143-A, NI Act, it 
was submitted that for addressing the issue of 
undue delay and for providing relief to the payees 
of dishonoured cheque, it is only just and fair that 
this 
be 
done 
through 
payment 
of 
interim 
compensation by the director or any such person in 
charge of the company. This would be in alignment 
with the purposes and objectives of the provision. 
21. Further, it was argued that in the present case the 
company is admitted to CIRP, thus being its alter 
ego, it is only the directors who can be directed to 
pay interim compensation in furtherance of the 
object of the provision in light of the CIRP 
proceedings against the company, the payees of the 
dishonoured cheque cannot be left with no interim 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 15 of 22 
 
relief, thereby defeating the purpose of Section 143-
A and causing injustice to the payees already 
suffering due to the pending litigation. 
22. Learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
appellant 
further 
submitted that any restrictive interpretation of the 
provision would defeat the purpose of providing 
interim 
compensation 
to 
the 
payee 
of 
a 
dishonoured cheque. To further strengthen their 
argument, they relied upon this Court’s judgment 
in Aneeta Hada (Supra)9 and submitted that in 
para 20 of the judgment, this Court has observed 
that an authorised signatory of a company becomes 
a drawer as he has been authorised to do so in 
respect of the account maintained by the company. 
23. Lastly, it was submitted that since the company is 
in moratorium and that it is admitted by the 
respondents that their case is not that they are 
unable to pay compensation, the grant of a meagre 
four percent of the cheque amount by each of them 
is just and fair. That even such an amount in the 
form of interim payment would serve the purposes 
of the provision and would also help the business 
of the appellant.

Page 16 of 22 
 
SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS 
24. The learned senior counsel for the respondents, Mr. 
Siddharth Dave, vehemently argued that it is a well 
settled position of law that an authorised signatory 
of a company is not a drawer of the cheque. To 
substantiate this argument, he relied upon this 
Court’s judgment in N. Harihara Krishnan 
(Supra) wherein it was held that, “Every person 
signing the cheque on behalf of a company on whose 
account the cheque is drawn does not become the 
drawer of the cheque. Such a signatory is only a 
person duly authorised to sign the cheque on behalf 
of the company/drawer of the cheque.” 
25. Further rejecting the submissions made by the 
appellant with regard to the observations made in 
the case of Aneeta Hada (Supra), it was submitted 
by Mr. Dave that in this judgment this Court was 
dealing with the question of extending criminal 
liability on the officers of the company and it held 
that the criminal liability for the dishonour of 
cheque primarily falls on the drawer company and 
is thereby extended to those in charge of it only 
when the conditions provided under Section 141 
are satisfied. Therefore, the Court did not hold that 
the authorised signatory becomes a drawer but 
only made a reference and an observation to this 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 17 of 22 
 
effect to elucidate that the criminal liability extends 
from the company to its directors and other officers 
by virtue of the cheque drawn on the company’s 
account by such authorised signatory. 
26. It was further submitted that with respect to the 
interpretation of the provision, the appellant’s 
argument that the meaning of ‘drawer’ under 
Section 143-A 
must be 
read 
liberally 
and 
purposively is contrary to the position of law on 
interpretation of statutes. Further submission is 
that such an interpretation of penal statues is 
contrary to the settled principles of criminal law, as 
penal provisions are to be read strictly in order to 
determine the liability of a party, more so where 
vicarious 
liability 
is 
to 
be 
determined. 
To 
substantiate this, he relied upon the judgment of 
this Court in the case of K.K. Ahuja v. V.K. 
Vohra.10 
27. In conclusion, it was submitted that the primary 
liability for an offence under Section 138 is that of 
the company itself and the company’s management 
is only subsequently and vicariously liable. Thus, it 
is only the company that is to be considered as the 
drawer of the cheque. Consequently, a strict 
interpretation of Section 143-A would mean that it 
 
10 (2009) 10 SCC 48 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 18 of 22 
 
is only the drawer-company’s liability to pay the 
interim compensation as the provision does not 
provide for an interim compensation to be paid by 
the employees or the management or the signatory 
of the company. 
ANALYSIS 
 
28. The High Court's interpretation of Section 7 of the 
NI Act accurately identified the "drawer" as the 
individual 
who 
issues 
the 
cheque. 
This 
interpretation is fundamental to understanding the 
obligations and liabilities under Section 138 of the 
NI Act, which makes it clear that the drawer must 
ensure sufficient funds in their account at the time 
the cheque is presented. The appellants' argument 
that directors or other individuals should also be 
liable under Section 143A misinterprets the 
statutory language and intent. The primary 
liability, as correctly observed by the High Court, 
rests on the drawer, emphasizing the drawer's 
responsibility for maintaining sufficient funds. 
29. The general rule against vicarious liability in 
criminal law underscores that individuals are not 
typically held criminally liable for acts committed 
by others unless specific statutory provisions 
extend such liability. Section 141 of the NI Act is 
one such provision, extending liability to the 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 19 of 22 
 
company's officers for the dishonour of a cheque. 
The appellants' attempt to extend this principle to 
Section 143A, to hold directors or other individuals 
personally liable for interim compensation, is 
unfounded. The High Court rightly emphasized that 
liability under Section 141 arises from the conduct 
or omission of the individual involved, not merely 
their position within the company. 
30. The 
distinction 
between 
legal 
entities 
and 
individuals acting as authorized signatories is 
crucial. Authorized signatories act on behalf of the 
company but do not assume the company's legal 
identity. This principle, fundamental to corporate 
law, ensures that while authorized signatories can 
bind the company through their actions, they do 
not merge their legal status with that of the 
company. This distinction supports the High 
Court's interpretation that the drawer under 
Section 143A refers specifically to the issuer of the 
cheque, not the authorized signatories.  
31. The principle of statutory interpretation, particularly 
in relation to Sections 143A and 148, was also 
correctly applied by the High Court. The Court 
emphasized that when statutory language is clear 
and unambiguous, it should be given its natural and 
ordinary 
meaning. 
The 
legislative 
intent, 
as 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 20 of 22 
 
discerned from the plain language of the statute, 
aims to hold the drawer accountable. The appellants' 
argument for a broader interpretation to include 
authorized 
signatories 
under 
Section 
143A 
contradicts this principle and would lead to an 
unjust extension of liability not supported by the 
statutory text.  
32. The High Court’s reliance on established legal 
precedents further reinforces its interpretation. 
Judicial precedents relied upon in the impugned 
judgment underscore the need for a literal 
interpretation of the statutory provisions. These 
precedents support the High Court's decision to limit 
the definition of 'drawer' to the issuer of the cheque, 
excluding authorized signatories.  
33. The appellants’ reliance on the judgment in 
Aneeta Hada (Supra),11 is misplaced and out of 
context. While this case underscored the necessity 
of involving the company as an accused to maintain 
a prosecution under Section 141, it does not support 
the extension of liability to authorized signatories 
under Section 143A. The judgment nowhere lays 
down that directors or authorised signatories would 
come under the ambit of ‘drawer’ for the purposes of 
Section 
143A. 
The 
appellants' 
interpretation 
 
11 (2012) 5 SCC 661 

SLP(Crl.) Nos. 8849-8850 of 2023  
 
Page 21 of 22 
 
conflates the roles of authorized signatories and 
drawers, which are distinct under the NI Act. 
Appellants have relied upon a single paragraph, 
which does not form part of the ratio therein, to 
substantiate their argument. But in this relied upon 
paragraph, the Court only made an observation that 
the authorised signatory becomes a drawer for the 
company, for the limited purpose of extending the 
criminal liability as per Section 141.  
34. The 
respondents 
correctly 
argued 
that 
an 
authorized signatory is not a drawer of the cheque, 
as established in N. Harihara Krishnan (Supra).12 
This judgment clarified that a signatory is merely 
authorized to sign on behalf of the company and 
does not become the drawer. The respondents' 
interpretation aligns with the principle that penal 
statutes should be interpreted strictly, particularly 
in determining vicarious liability. The judgment in 
K.K. Ahuja (Supra),13 further supports this 
approach, emphasizing that penal provisions must 
be read strictly to determine liability.  
35. In conclusion, the High Court’s decision to 
interpret 'drawer' strictly as the issuer of the cheque, 
excluding authorized signatories, is well-founded.

This interpretation aligns with the legislative intent, 
established legal precedents, and principles of 
statutory interpretation. The primary liability for an 
offence under Section 138 lies with the company, 
and the company’s management is vicariously liable 
only under specific conditions provided in Section 
141. The appellants' submissions are thus rejected, 
and the High Court’s judgment is upheld. This 
decision maintains the clarity and consistency of the 
law regarding cheque dishonour cases, ensuring 
that liability is appropriately assigned to the 
responsible parties under the NI Act. Therefore, the 
question of law put before this Court is answered in 
the negative.  
36. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. Pending 
application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
