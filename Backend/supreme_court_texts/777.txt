which was partly allowed under the impugned judgment 
whereunder, his conviction under Section 498-A of the 
Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short, ‘the IPC’) was 
confirmed and the sentence imposed therefor was 
commuted to the period of imprisonment already 
undergone.  
2. 
The second respondent, who is the father of the 
deceased Renuka, lodged FIR No.87/11 before Wadala 
T.T. Police Station on 17.04.2011 on her unnatural death 
occurred on 16.04.2011. Two Sessions Cases viz., 
621/2011 and 853/2011 emerged therefrom.  The first 
and sixth accused in the crime faced trial in the former 
Sessions Case and the appellant herein along with others 
faced trial in the latter Sessions Case, for the offences 
punishable under Sections 498-A, 304-B, 306 and 406 
read with Section 34, IPC.  After the joint trial, all the 
accused were convicted for the offence punishable 
under Section 498-A read with Section 34, IPC, and 
sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 3 years 
each and to pay a fine of Rs. 1000/- each and in default of 
payment of fine to undergo rigorous imprisonment of 2 
months.  Since in this appeal we are only concerned with 
the appellant, the 3rd accused, we are not going to refer 
to the details of conviction of others except to the extent 

Page 3 of 11 
SLP (Crl.) No. 8245 of 2023 
necessary, at the appropriate place.  The appellant 
herein was the third accused in the said crime after 
subjected to trial in SC No.853/2011 and in respect of all 
the other offences he was acquitted.  It is against the 
conviction and the modified sentence handed down for 
the aforesaid offence that he along with the co-convicts 
in the said Sessions Case filed Criminal Appeal No.1014 
of 2014. 
3. 
The case of the prosecution is as under: - 
The daughter of the second respondent, Renuka-
the victim, was married to the first accused Rajesh Jagan 
Karote on 11.12.2008 as per Hindu customs and rituals.  
The said Rajesh Jagan Karote and his relatives 
demanding dowry for purchasing a residential flat and 
used to torture her physically and mentally.  On 
16.04.2011 at about 9.00 pm the appellant herein, who is 
the husband of Savita, one of the sisters-in-law of the 
deceased, informed the second respondent that Renuka 
was admitted in Sion Hospital at Mumbai and by the time 
the second respondent along with his wife, children and 
other relatives reached the hospital Renuka breathed 
her last.  On her body he noticed abrasion on forehead 
and ligature marks on the neck.  Suspecting the death of 

Page 4 of 11 
SLP (Crl.) No. 8245 of 2023 
his daughter as unnatural death, he lodged a complaint 
which resulted in the registration of the aforementioned 
FIR and ultimately, the consequential trial of the accused.  
The appellant herein was also implicated as one of the 
accused and as noted hereinbefore, he stood the trial 
which culminated in his conviction under Section 498-A, 
IPC, and consequential imposition of sentence, as 
mentioned hereinbefore. 
4. 
Heard the learned counsels appearing for the 
parties. 
5. 
Manifold contentions were raised by the appellant 
to assail the judgment of conviction passed by the High 
Court confirming his conviction under Section 498-A, 
IPC.  Though the sentence imposed therefor by the trial 
Court was interfered with by the High Court in the appeal 
and converted it to the sentence already undergone the 
appellant is aggrieved inasmuch as pursuant to his 
conviction and consequently imposed sentence he was 
terminated from the post of Laboratory Attendant, 
Balbheem College, Beed, as per order dated 23.11.2015.  
It is the contention of the appellant that the very case of 
the prosecution is that since January, 2010, the first 
accused and his relatives demanded dowry and started 
torturing Renuka physically and mentally to fetch Rs. 5 

Page 5 of 11 
SLP (Crl.) No. 8245 of 2023 
lakhs for purchasing house under MHADA Scheme and 
the fact is that his marriage with the second accused 
Savita was solemnised only on 26.10.2010 and hardly 
within five and half months the unfortunate incident 
occurred.  According to the learned counsel for the 
appellant the said indisputable facts obtained from the 
materials on record would reveal that the appellant had 
not even had opportunity to interact with the deceased 
much less to harass or to show cruelty to her.  The 
learned counsel would further contend that the said 
circumstances and the conspicuous absence of specific 
accusation and lack of any specific evidence against the 
appellant would reveal that the implication of the 
appellant in the case is because of the unwholesome 
attitude over implication, which was deprecated by this 
Court.  Furthermore, it is submitted that the implication 
of accused Nos.5 and 4, who are respectively another 
sister-in-law and husband of the deceased and their 
acquittal would fortify the factum over implication.  In 
short, it is the contention that during the alleged period 
of torture for dowry of Rs. 5 lakhs, which is the main 
alleged cruelty, the appellant was not even a relative of 
the first accused and his family, to fall within the 
expression ‘relative’ used in Section 498-A, IPC.  That 

Page 6 of 11 
SLP (Crl.) No. 8245 of 2023 
apart, it is the contention of the appellant that there is 
absolute absence of any evidence against the appellant 
to connect him with the alleged crime and it is only 
because he being the husband of the second accused 
who is the sister of the first accused, the husband of the 
deceased that he was implicated.  Yet another contention 
was taken to the effect that in the absence of any 
evidence against the appellant he ought to have been 
acquitted extending, at least the benefit of doubt granted 
in the case of accused No.4 and 5 who are respectively 
the husband of Kavita and Kavita, another sister of 
accused No.1. As per the impugned judgment, 
Harinarayan Raja Ram Kurane (accused No.4) and Kavita 
Harinarayan Kurane (accused No.5) were acquitted by 
the High Court under Section 498-A, IPC.  It is also the 
contention of the appellant that there is absolutely no 
basis for the finding in paragraph 42 of the impugned 
judgment, which reads thus:- 
“In view of the specific material evidence against 
accused No.2, 3, 6 and 7 in respect of subjecting 
the deceased to harassment and cruelty on 
account of demand of dowry till her last breath 
would make them liable for an offence punishable 
under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code.” 
(Underline supplied)

6. 
A scanning of the impugned judgment would 
reveal that even after detailed discussion of the oral 
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses nothing specific 
was unearthed against the appellant herein, by both the 
trial Court and the High Court.  
7. 
Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the 
respondents would submit that the trial Court as also the 
High Court carefully examined the evidence and arrived 
at the finding of guilt against the appellant based on 
proper appreciation of evidence.  
8. 
A bare perusal of Section 498-A would reveal that 
the following as the essential ingredient to attract the 
said offence :- 
(a) 
The victim was a married lady (may also be a 
widow); 
(b) 
That she has been subjected to cruelty by her 
husband or relative(s) of her husband; 
(c) 
That such cruelty consisted of either (i) 
harassment with a view to coerce meeting a 
demand for dowry, or (ii) a wilful contact by the 
husband or his relative of such a nature as is 
likely to lead the lady to commit suicide or to 
cause grave injury to her life, limb or health; 

Page 8 of 11 
SLP (Crl.) No. 8245 of 2023 
(d) 
That such injury as aforesaid may be physical or 
mental. 
 
9. 
On an anxious consideration of the materials on 
record would reveal that the main instance of demand for 
Rs. 5 lakhs for the purpose of purchasing residential flat 
was allegedly occurred since January, 2010 onwards.  
But then, the evidence on record would show that the 
marriage between the appellant and Savita (accused 
No.2) who is one of the sisters of the first accused was 
conducted much later viz., only on 26.10.2010.  The 
unfortunate incident resulting in her death occurred 
hardly within five and half months since he became a 
relative of the family of the husband of the deceased.  It 
is a fact that despite the general, vague allegation no 
specific accusation was raised against the appellant.  
That apart, despite our microscopic examination, we 
could not find any specific evidence brought out by the 
prosecution against the appellant herein through anyone 
of the witnesses.  In other words, the fact discernible 
from the impugned judgment is that none of the 
prosecution witnesses had specifically deposed against 
the appellant herein of his having committed any cruelty 
which will attract the offence under Section 498-A, IPC, 

Page 9 of 11 
SLP (Crl.) No. 8245 of 2023 
against him.  There is also no case that no complaints 
were filed implicating the appellant earlier to the subject 
FIR.  In short, we find that there is no scintilla of evidence 
against the appellant herein to hold that he has 
committed the offence under Section 498-A, IPC, even 
with the aid of Section 34, IPC.  Being the husband of the 
second accused, Savita, who was found guilty by the 
courts below for the aforesaid offence cannot be a 
ground to hold the appellant guilty under the said 
offence in the absence of any specific material on record.  
10. 
Para 35 and 36 of the judgment of the trial Court 
would reveal the manner how the appellant was found 
guilty.  They read thus: 
“35. It is brought into the argument that there are 
no specific allegations against rest of the accused 
except husband and mother-in-law, However 
they were staying and witnessing all the incidents 
in the house, Though specific act of the other 
accused is not there in evidence making the victim 
to work like servant and allowing the accused no.1 
to 6 do cruelty is also not different than assisting 
them. However the gravity of ill-treatment to 
which Renuka was subjected is due to the acts of 
Accused No.1 and 6. They repeatedly assaulted 
and subjected Renuka cruelty Old burn marks 
dearly point out the previous incident of cruelty. 
 

Page 10 of 11 
SLP (Crl.) No. 8245 of 2023 
36. Thus, considering the circumstances it is found 
that prosecution has clearly proved the guilt of all 
the accused punishable under section 498-A r/w. 
34 and 304-B of Indian Penal Code 1860 against 
accused No.1 and 6. Hence point No.2 and 3 are 
answered in the affirmative.” 
 
 
We have already referred to and extracted 
paragraph 4 of the impugned judgment in the appeal. 
11. 
In the contextual situation, it is only appropriate to 
keep reminded of the observations of this Court in the 
decision in Preeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand1.  This 
Court observed that it is a matter of common knowledge 
that exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in 
a large number of complaints and the tendency of over 
implication is also reflected in a large number of cases. 
12. 
We are of the view that in view of such 
circumstances, the courts have to be careful to identify 
instances of over implication and to avert the suffering of 
ignominy and inexpiable consequences, by such 
persons. 
13. 
The upshot of the discussion is that the finding of 
guilt against the appellant by the courts below for the 
offence under Section 498-A, IPC, with the aid of Section 
 
1 (2010) 7 SCC 667 

Page 11 of 11 
SLP (Crl.) No. 8245 of 2023 
34, IPC, is absolutely perverse in view of the absolute 
absence of any evidence against him to connect him with 
the said offence in any manner. 
14. 
For the reasons given above the conviction of the 
appellant 
under 
Section 
498-A, 
IPC, 
and 
the 
consequential imposition of sentence therefor cannot be 
sustained.  Hence, the appeal is allowed, consequently, 
the impugned judgment and order dated 15.12.2020, 
passed by the High Court of Judicature of Bombay at 
Bombay in Criminal Appeal No.1014 of 2014, and the 
judgment of the trial Court dated 09.12.2014 in Sessions 
Case No.853/2011, qua the appellant are set aside and 
the appellant is acquitted of the offence under Section 
498-A, IPC.
