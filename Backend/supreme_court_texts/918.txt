The present appeal calls in question the correctness of the 
judgment and order dated 05.06.2023 passed by the Madurai 
Bench of Madras High Court in Crl. R.C. (MD) No. 583 of 2018. 
The appellant stands convicted for offences punishable under 
Section 279 and 304(A) of the Indian Penal Code (for short 
‘IPC’). The Judicial Magistrate, Nilakottai under Section 279

IPC sentenced the appellant by imposing a fine of Rs. 1000/-. For 
the offence under Section 304(A) of IPC, a sentence of one-year 
simple imprisonment along with fine of Rs. 5,000/- was imposed. 
Appropriate default sentences were also imposed. Aggrieved, the 
appellant challenged his conviction and sentence before the 
Additional Sessions Judge, Dindigul who confirmed the 
conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court. On further 
revision, the High Court, while maintaining the conviction, 
modified the sentence to that of three months simple 
imprisonment. 
3. 
When the matter came up on 06.10.2023, the learned Judge 
in Chambers exempted the appellant from surrendering till the 
first date of hearing. The interim protection was extended on 
06.11.2023.  On 13.12.2023, the appellant offered to deposit an 
amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) towards 
compensation to the kin of the deceased. The statement was 
recorded and the interim protection was extended. The amount 
of Rs. 1,00,000/- since deposited is lying in the fixed deposit in 

3 
 
the court. Thereafter, the learned counsel for the appellant filed 
an application to implead the legal representatives of the 
deceased. The notice on the application has been served but no 
one has entered appearance. We allow the said application and 
implead the mother of the deceased as a party respondent.  
4. 
We have heard Mr. A. Velan, learned counsel for the 
appellant and Mr. Sabarish Subramanian, learned counsel for the 
State. We have perused the records. 
5. 
The case of the prosecution is that on 09.01.2013, at about 
05:15 AM, the deceased Karthik and PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3 
were taking their cows for grazing. While they were proceeding 
on the Nilakottai to Madurai road, near Karigalan petrol pump, 
the appellant drove his lorry in a rash and negligent manner and 
hit the cows as well as the deceased. In view of the mishap, 
Karthik died and six cows were also killed.  An F.I.R. No. 08 of 
2013 dated 09.01.2013 under Sections 279, 304(A) of IPC read 
with Section 4(1)(A) read with Section 21(1)(A) of the Mines 

4 
 
and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act was registered 
since the prosecution had a case that river sand was being carried 
illegally. The appellant has been acquitted for charges under the 
Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act.  
6. 
The prosecution examined PW-1 to PW-17 and marked 
Exh.P-1 to P-9. The trial court convicted the appellant which was 
confirmed by the Appellate Court. The High Court in revision 
only modified the sentence.  
7. 
We have examined the evidence of the eye-witnesses and 
they are consistent in their story that the appellant drove the lorry 
in a rash and negligent manner and caused the death of the 
deceased as well as the six cows. The witnesses have expressly 
denied the suggestion that the cattle were running on the road 
afraid of the light and Karthik had died due to the trampling of 
the cows.  
8. 
Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and 
carefully perusing the records of the case, we see no reason to 

5 
 
interfere with the conviction under Sections 279 and 304(A) of 
IPC imposed by the courts below.  
9. 
However, we are inclined to allow the appeal partly on the 
ground of sentence. The incident is of the year 2013. Eleven 
years have elapsed since the incident occurred. The appellant has 
been on bail throughout.  It also emerges from the case of the 
prosecution that the witnesses and the deceased were negotiating 
about 70 cattle on the road. While we do not absolve the 
appellant from the act of rash and negligent driving, we certainly 
want to keep the above factors in mind while considering the 
sentence. The appellant has deposited a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- to 
be payable to the mother of the deceased who is the sole legal 
heir. Though served, she is not appearing.  
10. In view of the special facts of this case, while upholding the 
conviction, we set aside the sentence of three months simple 
imprisonment.  We also set aside the fine of Rs.1,000/- for the 
offence under Section 279 of IPC as well as fine of Rs. 5,000/- 

6 
 
for the offence under Section 304(A) of IPC.   Instead, while 
maintaining the conviction, we order that the amount of Rs. 
1,00,000/- deposited in this Court along with interest be paid to 
Mrs. Ponnalaghu W/o Vellaisamy (mother of the deceased), 
Ramar Kovil Street, M. Vadipatti Post Nilaikottai Taluk, 
Dindigul, District 624211.  This is on account of the loss suffered 
by her on account of the act of the appellant and we pass this 
order in exercise of powers under Section 357(3) of the Cr.P.C.   
11. The amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- lying in the fixed deposit, 
along with accrued interest in the registry of this Court will stand 
transferred to the court of Principal District and Sessions Judge, 
Dindigul.  The Principal District and Sessions Judge shall direct 
the respondent herein the Inspector of Police, Nilakottai Station, 
Dindigul to reach out to the mother of the deceased as per the 
particulars mentioned above. The Principal District and Sessions 
Judge shall, after being satisfied about the identity, release the 
amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- along with interest that has accrued to 
the mother of the deceased. 

7 
 
12. The Principal District and Sessions Judge shall send 
necessary information with regard to the compliance of the above 
directions to the Registry of this Court.  
13. Let the matter be listed in the last week of February, 2025 
for reporting status on compliance.  
14. The appeal is partly allowed in the above terms.
