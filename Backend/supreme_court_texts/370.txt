FACTUAL ASPECTS IN CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4702 OF 2023 
1. 
The appellant- National Highways Authority of India Ltd. 
has been constituted under Section 3 of the National Highways 
Authority of India Act, 1988.  On 2nd June 2004, the appellant 
awarded a contract to the respondent for the work of the 
Allahabad Bypass Project, which involved the construction of a 
road from km 158 to km 198 (except a bridge on the river). The 
total cost of the project was Rs.4,46,99,12,839/-.  A dispute

between the parties was referred to the Dispute Resolution 
Board.  The Board gave its recommendations.  Ultimately, the 
dispute was referred to an Arbitral Tribunal of three 
arbitrators.  There were three claims referred to arbitration, 
which are as follows: 
• Claim 
no.1 
- 
Reimbursement 
of 
additional 
expenditure incurred due to an increase in the rates 
of royalty and associated sales tax on soil, sand and 
crushed stone aggregates; 
• Claim no.2 - Non-payment for executed work of 
embankment with soil/pond ash for the initial 150 
mm depth stripped in accordance with the 
requirements of the contract and 
• Claim no.3 - Reimbursement of additional costs 
incurred due to an increase in the forest transit fee 
rates. 
2. 
The Arbitral Tribunal made an award on 30th March 
2010.  The summary of the award is as follows: 
• Claim no.1 – The Arbitral Tribunal granted an 
amount of Rs.2,69,91,248/- as an additional cost 
to the respondent till 31st December 2008, along 
with interest and future interest of 12% per annum. 
A direction was also issued to the appellant to pay 
an additional cost to the respondent post-31st 
December 2008 on account of an increase in royalty 
charges and associated sales tax; 

Civil Appeal no.4702 of 2023 etc.           
 
Page 3 of 15 
 
• Claim no. 2 - Two members of the Arbitral Tribunal 
consisting of three members held that the 
respondent 
was 
entitled 
to 
Rs.3,47,35,522/- 
towards the formation of the embankment for an 
initial 150 mm, along with a price adjustment on 
the said amount in accordance with clause 70.3 of 
the contract, with interest and future interest at 
12% per annum. The third member of the Arbitral 
Tribunal dissented and held that the respondent 
was not entitled to any amount under the said 
claim.   
• Claim no.3 - The respondent was granted 
Rs.3,77,74,427.39/- along with interest and future 
interest at 12% per annum. 
3. 
Being aggrieved by the award, the appellant filed a 
petition under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation 
Act, 1996 (for short ‘the Arbitration Act’). By the impugned 
judgment and order dated 30th November 2011, the learned 
Single Judge confirmed the award in respect of Claim no.1 and 
Claim no.3, relying upon the decision of the High Court in the 
case of National Highways Authority of India v. M/s. ITD 
Cementation India Limited1.  Regarding Claim no.2, the 
learned Single Judge held that the award was a majority 
decision of the Arbitral Tribunal based on an analysis of the 
material placed before the Arbitral Tribunal. Therefore, the 
 
1 2008 (100) DRJ 431 

Civil Appeal no.4702 of 2023 etc.           
 
Page 4 of 15 
 
award for Claim no.2 was upheld. Being aggrieved by the said 
judgment and order, the appellant preferred an appeal under 
Section 37 of the Arbitration Act before a Division Bench of the 
Delhi High Court.  By the impugned judgment, the said appeal 
has been dismissed.  From the impugned judgment, it appears 
that the submissions made before the Division Bench of Delhi 
High Court were confined to Claim nos. 1 and 2.  By the 
impugned judgment, the appeal preferred by the appellant was 
dismissed.  Being aggrieved by the Arbitral Tribunal’s award 
and the judgments of the High Court, the appellant has 
preferred the present appeal.  At the outset, we may note here 
that one of the grounds of challenge in the present appeal was 
that the decision of the High Court in the case of National 
Highways Authority of India v. M/s. ITD Cementation India 
Limited1 was the subject matter of challenge before this Court.  
We may state that by judgment and order dated 24th April 
20152, the said appeal has been partly allowed by setting aside 
the award made on claim no.8. 
SUBMISSIONS 
4. 
The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant 
pointed out that an increase in the rates of royalty on soil, sand 
and crushed stones which aggregates through a notification, 
would be adjusted as per sub-clause 70.3 (vii) of the contract, 
which provides for a price adjustment for all local material 
based on Wholesale Price Index (WPI).  The learned counsel 
submitted that while submitting the bid, the appellant 
 
2 (2015) 14 SCC 21 

Civil Appeal no.4702 of 2023 etc.           
 
Page 5 of 15 
 
accepted that WPI would be the only yardstick to be used in 
the matter of price adjustment.  The learned counsel submitted 
that the Division Bench erroneously interpreted clause 70.8 of 
the agreement. 
5. 
The learned senior counsel submitted that though the 
contract provided for partly fixed and partly adjustable prices, 
the adjustment in costs for inputs would be covered only to the 
extent to which they are covered by a formula in clause no. 
70.3 of the agreement.  She submits that the learned Single 
Judge and Division Bench of the High Court have failed to 
notice that clause 70.8 starts with a non-obstante clause. It 
provides that such additional or reduced costs shall not be 
separately paid or credited if the same has already been taken 
into consideration in the indexing of any inputs to the price 
adjustment formulae in accordance with clauses 70.1 to 70.7.  
She submits that in the present case, such additional costs 
have been dealt with in Clause 70.3 (vii).  She submitted that 
the sales tax was not increased based on legislation.  The 
learned 
senior 
counsel 
submitted 
that 
the 
work 
of 
embankment construction is a part of the work of clearing and 
grubbing, which includes backfilling up to 150 mm.  She 
submitted that when topsoil is removed as it is unfit for 
construction, this activity has to be a part of clearing and 
grubbing.  On facts, she submitted that no evidence had been 
placed on record to show that the Engineer had required the 
respondent to remove the top 150 mm of soil in all places.  She 
submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal and the Courts must 
strictly interpret the contract. Just because the respondent has 

Civil Appeal no.4702 of 2023 etc.           
 
Page 6 of 15 
 
incurred some expenditure, it would not amount to a liability 
on the appellant which is covered by clause 70.8 of the 
agreement. She has pointed out the factual aspects of the 
connecting cases. 
6. 
The learned counsel representing the respondents in the 
appeals pointed out that the scope of interference in a petition 
under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act is narrow, and the 
jurisdiction of the Appellate Court under Section 37 is still 
narrower.  The learned counsel pointed out that the impugned 
judgments relied upon a decision of the Delhi High Court in the 
case of the National Highways Authority of India v. M/s. 
ITD Cementation India Limited1.  He submitted that the said 
decision had been upheld by this Court by judgment and order 
dated 24th April 20152 in Civil Appeal no. 9799 of 2010 and 
other connected cases.  The submission is that the decision of 
this Court completely covers the respondent's claims nos. 1 
and 3.  The learned counsel invited our attention to the 
majority view of the Arbitral Tribunal on the claim regarding 
expenses incurred for making an embankment.  It was 
submitted that the view taken by the majority is the view of the 
experts, which does not call for any interference. 
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS 
7. 
We may note here that the impugned judgments in all 
connected appeals are based on the impugned judgment in 
Civil Appeal no. 4702 of 2023. In this case, we are dealing with 
concurrent findings arrived at by the Arbitral Tribunal, the 
learned Single Judge in a petition under Section 34 of the 

Civil Appeal no.4702 of 2023 etc.           
 
Page 7 of 15 
 
Arbitration Act, and the Division Bench in appeal under 
Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. In this case, we are concerned 
with the construction of the terms of a contract between the 
parties.  In the case of Parsa Kente Collieries Ltd. v. 
Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd.3,  in 
paragraphs 9.1 and 9.2, this Court held thus:  
“9.1. 
 In Associate 
Builders [Associate 
Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 
2 SCC (Civ) 204], this Court had an 
occasion 
to 
consider 
in 
detail 
the 
jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with 
the award passed by the Arbitrator in 
exercise of powers under Section 34 of the 
Arbitration Act. In the aforesaid decision, 
this Court has considered the limits of 
power of the Court to interfere with the 
arbitral award. It is observed and held 
that only when the award is in conflict 
with the public policy in India, the Court 
would be justified in interfering with the 
arbitral award. In the aforesaid decision, 
this Court considered different heads of 
“public policy in India” which, inter alia, 
includes patent illegality. After referring 
Section 28(3) of the Arbitration Act and 
after considering the decisions of this 
Court 
in McDermott 
International 
Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. [McDermott 
International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., 
(2006) 11 SCC 181] , SCC paras 112-113 
and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. v. Dewan 
Chand Ram Saran [Rashtriya Ispat Nigam 
 
3 (2019) 7 SCC 236 

Civil Appeal no.4702 of 2023 etc.           
 
Page 8 of 15 
 
Ltd. v. Dewan Chand Ram Saran, (2012) 5 
SCC 306] , SCC paras 43-45, it is observed 
and held that an Arbitral Tribunal must 
decide in accordance with the terms of the 
contract, but if an Arbitrator construes a 
term of the contract in a reasonable 
manner, it will not mean that the award 
can be set aside on this ground. It is 
further 
observed 
and 
held 
that 
construction of the terms of a contract 
is primarily for an Arbitrator to decide 
unless the Arbitrator construes the 
contract in such a way that it could be 
said to be something that no fair-
minded or reasonable person could do. 
It is further observed by this Court in 
the aforesaid decision in para 33 that 
when a court is applying the “public 
policy” test to an arbitration award, it 
does not act as a court of appeal and 
consequently errors of fact cannot be 
corrected. A possible view by the 
Arbitrator on facts has necessarily to 
pass muster as the Arbitrator is the 
ultimate master of the quantity and 
quality of evidence to be relied upon 
when he delivers his arbitral award. It is 
further observed that thus an award 
based on little evidence or on evidence 
which does not measure up in quality to 
a trained legal mind would not be held 
to be invalid on this score. 
 
9.2.  Similar is the view taken by this 
Court in NHAI v.  ITD Cementation (India) 

Civil Appeal no.4702 of 2023 etc.

8. 
This Court laid down the law regarding the scope of 
interference in a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration 
Act in the case of MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd.4.  Paragraph 11 
reads thus: 
“11. As far as Section 34 is concerned, 
the position is well-settled by now that 
the Court does not sit in appeal over 
the arbitral award and may interfere on 
merits on the limited ground provided 
under Section 34(2)(b)(ii) i.e. if the award 
is against the public policy of India. As per 
the 
legal 
position 
clarified 
through 
decisions of this Court prior to the 
amendments to the 1996 Act in 2015, a 
violation of Indian public policy, in turn, 
includes a violation of the fundamental 
policy of Indian law, a violation of the 
interest of India, conflict with justice or 
morality, and the existence of patent 
illegality 
in 
the 
arbitral 
award. 
Additionally, 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
“fundamental policy of Indian law” would 
cover compliance with statutes and 
judicial precedents, adopting a judicial 
approach, compliance with the principles 
of 
natural 
justice, 
and Wednesbury [Associated 
Provincial 
Picture 
Houses v. Wednesbury 
Corpn., 
(1948) 1 KB 223 (CA)] reasonableness. 
 
4 (2019) 4 SCC 163 

Civil Appeal no.4702 of 2023 etc.           
 
Page 10 of 15 
 
Furthermore, “patent illegality” itself 
has been held to mean contravention of 
the 
substantive 
law 
of 
India, 
contravention of the 1996 Act, and 
contravention of the terms of the 
contract.” 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis added) 
9. 
This Court, in the case of UHL Power Company Ltd. v. 
State of Himachal Pradesh5 held that the jurisdiction of the 
Court under Section 34 is relatively narrow and the jurisdiction 
of the Appellate Court under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act 
is all the more circumscribed. In the light of the limited scope 
for interference under Section 37 appeal, we will have to deal 
with the submissions.  
10. 
We have carefully perused the material part of the award 
of the Arbitral Tribunal and the impugned judgments.  For 
convenience, we refer to the impugned judgment in Civil Appeal 
no. 4702 of 2023.  As can be seen from the impugned 
judgment, the present appellant confined the challenge only to 
two issues, which are set out in paragraph 2 of the impugned 
judgment. 
“2. Learned senior counsel for the 
appellant submits that there are two 
aspects, 
which 
are 
required 
to 
be 
examined in the present appeal:  
 
 
i) The allowing of the claims of the 
 
respondent on account of increase in 
 
royalty, sales tax and in the forest 
transit  
fee, 
stated 
to 
have 
been 
imposed by  
subsequent legislations;  
 
5 (2022) 4 SCC 116 

Civil Appeal no.4702 of 2023 etc.           
 
Page 11 of 15 
 
 
 
ii) The allowing of the claim for 
balance  amount for construction of 
embankment  which according to the 
appellant, formed a  part of the activity 
of clearing and  grubbing and was not 
payable as embankment work.” 
 
11. 
The Division Bench held that the imposition of a tax or 
upward revision of an already existing tax or levy through 
subsequent legislation is admittedly akin to the levy of 
additional royalty.  The Division Bench relied upon a decision 
of the same Court in the case of the National Highways 
Authority of India v. M/s. ITD Cementation India Limited1.   
The Division Bench in the impugned judgment held that the 
claim made on account of the increase in royalty, sales tax, 
forest transit fee, etc., was covered in favour of the respondent 
by the said decision.  As stated earlier, the decision in the case 
of the National Highways Authority of India v. M/s. ITD 
Cementation India Limited1 was confirmed by this Court by 
judgment dated 24th April 20152 with a partial modification.  A 
perusal of the said judgment shows that the issue therein was 
also regarding a claim based on an upward revision of royalty.  
Clauses 70 to 70.8 of the agreement quoted in the judgment 
are identical to those in the agreement subject matter of these 
appeals.  The argument before this Court was also the same 
that the WPI assessment would include a claim for enhanced 
royalty.  In paragraph 21 of the decision, this Court dealt with 
the impact of clauses 70.1 to 70.7 and 70.8.  In paragraph 21 
of the said decision, this Court held thus : 

Civil Appeal no.4702 of 2023 etc.           
 
Page 12 of 15 
 
“26. We now turn to the reasoning given 
by the Arbitral Tribunal in paras 21 to 23 
of the award, as quoted above. The award 
considers the impact of sub-clauses 70.1 
to 70.7 and agrees with the contention 
that the provision for cost escalation 
based on the agreed price adjustment 
formulae falls in one compartment while 
the compensation for additional cost 
resulting from a subsequent legislation 
falls in a separate category. In other 
words, the contention that stands 
accepted was, that the escalation in 
price premised on fluctuation in 
market value of the inputs stands on 
one footing, while the additional cost 
resulting from the impact of any 
statute, decree, ordinance, law etc as 
referred to in sub-clause 70.8 stands 
on 
the 
other. 
Resultantly 
the 
governing clauses in the instant case 
were held not to be sub-clauses 70.1 
to 70.7 but the substantive part of 
sub-clause 
70.8. 
The 
award 
also 
considered whether minor minerals in 
question were or were not included in the 
basket of materials whose cost variation 
was taken into account as an input while 
arriving at WPI. It also considered that 
the WPI is an index applicable uniformly 
in all states while the increase 2 Page 30 
in Seigniorage Fee would vary from state 
to state. It further dealt with the aspect 
that NHAI itself was of the opinion that 
the additional impact as a result of 
subsequent legislation was admissible 
separately, as signified by the letter 
dated 03.09.2003 to the Economic 
Advisor. In the backdrop of the law laid 
down by this court, the construction 
of the terms of the contract by the 
Arbitral 
Tribunal 
is 
completely 

Civil Appeal no.4702 of 2023 etc.           
 
Page 13 of 15 
 
consistent with the principles laid 
down by this court. Upon construing 
the terms and the material on record 
it concluded that the instant matter 
would be covered by substantive part 
of Sub-Clause 70.8 of COPA. It also 
noted that NHAI itself was of such 
opinion. The view so taken by the 
Arbitral Tribunal after considering the 
material on record and the terms of the 
contract is certainly a possible view, to 
say the least. We do not see any reason 
to interfere. The Division Bench in our 
considered view, was completely right 
and 
justified 
in 
dismissing 
the 
challenge.” 
  
 
 
 
(emphasis added) 
 
12. 
There was some controversy before the Division Bench on 
the issue whether there was an actual increase in the sales tax.  
However, after perusing the circular dated 1st December 2004, 
the Division Bench concluded that there was an addition of 3% 
in the amount of sales tax, as a result of which applicable sales 
tax increased from 22% to 25%.  In the light of the law laid 
down by this Court in the case of National Highways 
Authority of India2, the contention based on the first claim 
made by the respondent has no merit. 
13. 
Now, we turn to the issue of whether the claim for the 
construction of embankment forms part of the activity of 
clearing and grubbing and was not payable as embankment 
work.  We may note here that two expert members of the 
Arbitral Tribunal held in favour of the respondent on this point, 
whereas the third member dissented.  There cannot be any 

Civil Appeal no.4702 of 2023 etc.           
 
Page 14 of 15 
 
dispute that as far as the construction of the terms of a 
contract is concerned, it is for the Arbitral Tribunal to 
adjudicate upon.  If, after considering the material on record, 
the Arbitral Tribunal takes a particular view on the 
interpretation of the contract, the Court under Section 34 does 
not sit in appeal over the findings of the arbitrator.  The 
Division Bench has adverted to the findings recorded by the 
two members of the Arbitral Tribunal.  After considering the 
view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal, the High Court observed 
that the real controversy was whether the work of backfilling 
had been done and whether the said work was liable to be 
excluded from the work of the embankment construction by 
the respondent.  The Division Bench held that nothing is shown 
that indicates that the construction of the embankment can be 
said to have been done in a manner where the lower part of the 
embankment is made only by carrying out the activity of 
backfilling.  The High Court also noted that the appellant 
sought to make deductions after initially paying the amounts 
for the embankment.  The Division Bench was right in holding 
that the majority opinion of technical persons need not be 
subjected to a relook, especially when the learned Single Judge 
had also agreed with the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal.  
We have also perused the findings of the majority in the Award.  
We find nothing perverse or illegal about it. 
14. 
In our view, the learned Single Judge and the Division 
Bench of the High Court have examined the challenge to the 
award within four corners of limitation imposed by Sections 34 

Civil Appeal no.4702 of 2023 etc.           
 
Page 15 of 15 
 
and 37 of the Arbitration Act.  The view taken by the Arbitral 
Tribunal, the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench 
cannot be found fault with. 
15. 
Therefore, we find no merit in the appeals, and they are 
dismissed with no order as to costs.
