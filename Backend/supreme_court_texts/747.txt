(Respondent No.1 in the appeal) and directed him to surrender within three
weeks.
2.
The jurisprudential contour for a review petition was considered lately
in  Sanjay Kumar Agarwal v State Tax Officer, (2024) 2 SCC 362. The
present coram has taken note of the same in A S Raghavendra v Bharti
Airtel Limited, Review Petition (Civil) No.1425/20242. We have kept the
principles enumerated therein in mind.
3.
A glance at the petition would exhibit that the Petitioner is dissatisfied
on his understanding that: observations in Para 26 of the judgment of which
review is sought are incorrect and contrary to the record; ‘later period’ or
‘change in circumstances’ has not been specified; relevant precedents have
not been considered; ‘Bail is the Rule, Jail is the exception’ (sic) has been
ignored; all other arrested accused have been released on bail; etcetera.
4.
As to why the Petitioner, in his own words, has been ‘single(d) out’, we
need only point towards the well-accepted dicta, reiterated in Sanjay Dubey
v State of Madhya Pradesh3, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 610:
‘18.… It is too well-settled that judgments are not to
be read as Euclid's theorems; they are not to be
construed  as  statutes,  and;  specific  cases  are
authorities only for what they actually decide. We do
not want to be verbose in reproducing the relevant

paragraphs  but  deem  it  proper  to  indicate  some
authorities  on  this  point  -  Sreenivasa  General
Traders v State of Andhra Pradesh, (1983) 4 SCC
353 and Amar Nath Om Prakash v State of Punjab,
(1985) 1 SCC 345 - which have been reiterated, inter
alia, in BGS SGS Soma JV v NHPC Limited, (2020)
4 SCC 234, and Chintels India Limited v Bhayana
Builders Private Limited, (2021) 4 SCC 602.’
(emphasis supplied)
5.
The facts of every case vary and are to be judged in their unique
perspective. Grant of bail to co-accused would not  ipso facto  entitle the
instant  Petitioner  to  the  same.  Moreover,  the  record  indicates  that  the
Petitioner was arrested on 28.04.2021 and granted bail by the High Court on
13.10.2021. Hence, the Petitioner was incarcerated for about 6 months, nay,
5 ½ months only. This cannot be taken as ‘incarceration for a significant
period of time’ as sought to be projected by the Petitioner by relying on
Union of India v K A Najeeb, (2021) 3 SCC 713. Further, a reading of the
Judgment dated 28.08.2024 makes it clear that the Court was conscious of
the peculiarities of the case, as it was cancelling bail after almost three
years, and that Chargesheet had been filed.
6.
The  judgment  of  which  review  is  sought  has  considered  the  role
ascribed to the Petitioner, including the version in the Chargesheet. To allay
the Petitioner’s apprehensions, authorities concerned have been directed to
render appropriate care and assistance apropos his medical condition. The

4
calming caveat, that a bail application preferred afresh by the Petitioner shall
be considered on its own merits, without prejudice to the cancellation of bail
so ordered, also finds place in the Judgment dated 28.08.2024. We do not
appreciate the casual averment to the effect that ‘once bail granted by the
Hon’ble High Court is cancelled by this Hon’ble Court, neither the Learned
Trial Court  nor  the  Hon’ble  High  Court  would  grant  bail to  the  Review
Petitioner.’ The High Court, as also the Trial Court  in seisin, have been
specifically  permitted  by  this  Court  to  consider  the  Petitioner’s  bail
application, if and when preferred, ‘at a later period or in the event of a
change  in  circumstances’.  The  discretion  in  this  context,  albeit,  to  be
exercised in accordance with law, of the Court(s) below is left untouched.
Nevertheless, if the Petitioner chooses to so apply, while considering such
bail plea, the Court concerned need not feel inhibited by observations, if any,
against the Petitioner in the Judgment dated 28.08.2024, regard being had
to all due factors.
7.
Above being the position, a case for review is not discernible. This
petition is, thus, dismissed.
8.
Crl. M. P.  seeking listing of the review petition in Open Court for
hearing is rejected.

9.
Crl.  M.  P.  seeking  exemption  from  surrendering  is  dismissed  as
infructuous,  as  the  period  of  three  weeks  granted  to  the  Petitioner  to
surrender (reckoned from 28.08.2024) has long elapsed.
10.
Crl.  M.  P.  seeking  permission  to  file  additional  documents  stands
closed.
