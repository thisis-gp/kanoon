1. 
Leave granted.  
2. 
The decision of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana (the 
“High Court”) in Criminal Revision Petition bearing number 
CRR No. 3005 of 2013 is assailed before us.  
3. 
The Appellant was prosecuted along with 3 (three) other 
persons for offences punishable under Section 452, Section 323 
and Section 325 of the Indian Penal Code (the “IPC”). 
Thereafter, vide an order dated 22.04.2013, the Appellant came 
to be convicted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Nuh, Haryana 
(the “Trial Court”) in relation to offences punishable under (i) 
Section 323 read with Section 34; and (ii) Section 325 read with 
Section 34 of the IPC. Accordingly, the Trial Court sentenced the

(the “Trial Court Order”). 
4. 
The Trial Court Order was assailed before the Additional 
Session Judge, Nuh unsuccessfully, and thereafter challenged 
before the High Court. Vide an order dated 01.05.2023, the High 
Court partly allowed the Criminal Revision Petition i.e., upheld 
the conviction recorded by the Trial Court, however, on account 
of substantial delay i.e., extending to a period of almost 13 
(thirteen) years in the underlying trial, modified the sentence 
imposed by Trial Court on the Appellant, as under:

(the “Impugned Order”). 
5. 
Mr. Deepkaran Dayal, learned counsel appearing on behalf 
of the Appellant has drawn the attention of this Court to the fact 
that the Appellant has undergone almost 1/3rd of his sentence i.e., 
a period extending to 1 (one) month; and 3 (three) days.

Furthermore, he has submitted that the underlying offence 
pertains to 2010 and that the Appellant was made to suffer the 
agony of a protracted trial spanning over 13 (thirteen) years.  
Accordingly, it was urged before us that the sentence awarded to 
the Appellant be reduced to the period already undergone.  
6. 
Taking into consideration the totality of circumstances, 
coupled with the fact that underlying incident occurred in 2010, 
the appeal is allowed in part and the Impugned Order is modified 
to the extent that the Appellants’ sentence is reduced to the period 
already undergone i.e., 1 (one) month; and 3 (three) days. 
7. 
In view of the aforesaid, I.A. No. 126067 of 2023 i.e., an 
application seeking declaration of the Appellant as a juvenile at 
the time of the underlying offence, does not require any 
consideration by this Court. 
8. 
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. No 
order as to costs.
