PROPOSAL 
FOR 
RESOLUTION 
OF 
OUTSTANDING AIRPORT AND PARKING DUES (RS. 
240 CRORES AS OF AUGUST 31, 2020) 
 
[…]  
 
BKC Property not part of resolution - If CoC decides to 
retain the BKC Property as a non-core asset and not offer it 
as part of this resolution process as proposed above, then the 
Resolution Applicant will not pay the upfront sum of Rs. 10 
Crores to the Assenting Financial Creditors as envisaged in 
the above Clause for BKC Property. Further, then the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 11 of 168 
 
 
airport dues and parking charges after the ICD (approx. Rs. 
240 Crores as of August 31, 2020) will be paid by the 
Resolution Applicant upfront in priority over any other 
payments to the creditors of the Corporate Debtor, subject 
to a maximum of Rs. 475 Crores. As per the general aviation 
practice in respect to parking and airport space, as and when 
the Corporate Debtor will intend to use/ move the aircrafts 
or use the airport space, such claimants will seek their past 
dues. Therefore, their payments need to be resolved upfront 
by pro rata reduction of amounts payable to other creditors, 
to enable the Corporate Debtor to re-commence its 
operation, which is why the Resolution Applicant has 
suggested that their payments be made upfront against the 
BKC Property. SUCH PAYMENTS WILL BE SETTLED 
UPFRONT IN FULL IN FIRST 180 DAYS FROM THE 
EFFECTIVE 
DATE 
AND 
WITHOUT 
ANY 
CONDITIONS 
(INCLUDING 
NOT 
BEING 
STAGGERED 
PAYMENTS 
SPREAD 
ACROSS 
A 
PERIOD OF TIME) SO THAT FLYING CAN START 
IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT ANY FUTURE DISPUTES 
AND CONCERNS WITH SUCH CLAIMANTS FOR 
PAST DUES. Alternatively, the Resolution Professional can 
provide the Resolution Applicant with a no-dues certificate 
from such contingent creditors, in which case, these 
creditors will be treated in compliance with the provisions of 
the IBC. 
 
The Resolution Applicant states and confirms that this 
"Proposal for Resolution of outstanding airport and parking 
dues (approx. Rs. 240 Crores as of August 31, 2020)" which 
deals with the appropriation of the BKC Property is merely 
a proposal and not a condition to the implementation of this 
Resolution Plan and the CoC has the discretion to accept/ 
reject such proposal. If the above-mentioned proposal is 
acceptable to the CoC, then it is acceptable to the Resolution 
Applicant in the manner stated hereinabove.

6.4. Treatment of Stakeholders 
 
6.4.1. Treatment of outstanding CIRP Costs 
(a) In terms of Section 30(2)(a) of the IBC, the CIRP Costs 
are to be paid in priority to any other creditor of the 
Corporate Debtor. 
(b) As per the information disclosed by the Resolution 
Professional on August 14, 2020, the CIRP Costs includes: 
i. Operating and Process Costs (Rs. 27.16 Crores, as 
of August 31, 2020) which includes fees, charges, 
salaries of Asset Protection Team (APT) of the 
Corporate Debtor and other costs incurred by the 
Resolution Professional in running the operations of 
the Corporate Debtor as a going concern; 
ii. Interim Finance Cost (Rs. 54.4 Crores, as of August 
31, 2020). 
[…] 
(d) The Resolution Professional has also disclosed to the 
Resolution Applicant that the Corporate Debtor has a 
positive bank balance of approx. Rs. 92 Crores and estimates 
to collect a further sum of Rs. 40 Crores in the next 2-3 
months. 
[…] 
(f) The Resolution Professional has estimated an approx. 
sum of Rs. 240 Crores (as of August 31, 2020) towards 
parking charges for aircrafts and airport space lease 
charges. Such amounts are good faith estimates of the 
Resolution Professional based on previous invoices as it has 
not received any invoice/ demand from any of the lessors/ 
owners for such amounts. The Resolution Applicant shall 
endeavour to negotiate the parking fee and rental fee for the 
Corporate Debtor with the various airports and will 
endeavour that the cost for such heads is kept to the 
minimum. 
[…] 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 14 of 168 
 
 
(h) Based on the information provided, the Resolution 
Applicant have assumed that the amounts standing to the 
credit of the bank account of the Corporate Debtor 
(including amounts estimated to be received subsequently) 
are sufficient to cover for the CIRP Costs of the Corporate 
Debtor (excluding parking charges, rental charges, 
employee dues, taxes etc). Accordingly, the Resolution 
Applicant has set aside a sum of Rs. 25 Crores as CIRP Costs 
towards payment of any such costs until the Approval Date. 
Any expenses incurred by the Corporate Debtor from the 
Approval Date until the Effective Date will be incurred out 
of the positive bank balance of the Corporate Debtor. 
(i) As stated in Clause 6.3.1(d) above, if the CoC agrees to 
offer a clear and marketable title in the BKC Property (one 
floor) to the Resolution Applicant, then the Resolution 
Applicant shall settle the airport and parking charges 
(estimated at approx. Rs. 240 Crores, as of August 31, 2020). 
Savings from such charges will be distributed to the 
Assenting Financial Creditors. If the airport and parking 
charges over are over Rs. 245 Crores, then amounts over and 
above Rs. 245 Crores will be first paid out of Rs. 25 Crores 
reserved as CIRP Costs (if there are no outstanding CIRP 
Costs) and then out of the positive cash flows of the 
Corporate Debtor. Any amounts over and above such 
amounts will be shared between the Resolution Applicant 
and the Assenting Financial Creditors in equal proportion. 
(j) The Resolution Applicant states that if the CIRP Cost is

9.4. Implementation - The performance guarantee provided

with the terms of the RFRP.” 
 
 
5. The RP preferred an application under Section 30(6) read with Section 31 of 
the IBC, 2016 before the NCLT seeking approval of the Resolution Plan 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 27 of 168 
 
 
submitted by Respondent No.1 and vide order dated 22.06.2021, the NCLT 
approved the Resolution Plan. In view of the uncertainty regarding the 
achievement of the “Effective Date” under Clauses 7.6.2 and 7.6.4 of the 
Resolution Plan, it was clarified that the same would be fixed on the 90th day 
from the Plan Approval Order dated 22.06.2021. Respondent No.1 was also 
given liberty to approach the NCLT for appropriate orders with respect to an 
extension of the timeline, subject to a maximum of another 180 days, in case 
they fail to fulfill all the Conditions Precedent within 90 days. The relevant 
observations are reproduced hereinbelow:  
“33. During the hearing, the uncertainty of the time frame 
for implementation of the Resolution Plan was discussed. It 
is stated by the SRA in clause no. 7.6.2 (pdf 276) of the 
Resolution Plan that the effective date would mean the date 
of the fulfilment of all the conditions precedent as stated in 
clause 7.6.1 thereof. The SRA, at clause no. 7.6.4, has gone 
on to add that the consortium would make all endeavor to 
ensure all the compliances are done for the fulfillment of the 
conditions precedent within a period of 90 days. In the 
unlikely event that the conditions precedent are not complied 
within this period, SRA would require a maximum of 180 
days more to fulfil the conditions. Failing which the 
Resolution Plan would stand automatically withdrawn 
without any further act, deed or thing. In view of such 
uncertainty in the ‘effective date’ the Bench suggested that 
let the effective date be the 90th day from the Approval Date 
(clause 3.1 at pdf page 201). The SRA as well as the 
Applicant (RP of the Corporate Debtor) had agreed to the 
suggestion. This in our opinion is not in the nature of a 
substitution or addition to the decision, commercial or 
otherwise, of the CoC. The suggestion is made only to give 
finality and certainty to the effective date, which the SRA has 
otherwise committed in the Resolution Plan to endeavor to 
do. It could accordingly be ordered so. Failing which the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 28 of 168 
 
 
SRA / Corporate Debtor would be at liberty to approach this 
Authority for appropriate orders with regard to extension of 
the timeline, as would be deemed proper. That would help 
prevent the SRA from the frustration of ‘automatic 
withdrawal’ referred to in clause 7.6.4 of the Resolution 
Plan.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
6. Since the initial period of 90 days for fulfilment of the Conditions Precedent 
expired on 22.09.2021, an extension of another 90 days was granted by the 
NCLT vide order dated 29.09.2021 (1st extension). The 1st extension of 90 
days expired on 22.12.2021. The NCLT vide order dated 20.01.2022, again, 
granted an extension of another 90 days (2nd extension). The 2nd extension of 
90 days expired on 22.03.2022. The maximum extension that could have been 
provided under Clause 7.6.4 of the Resolution Plan i.e., an additional 180 
days, had now come to an end. However, vide order dated 11.04.2022, the 
NCLT granted exclusion of a period of 65 days from 17.01.2022 to 
22.03.2022, which was spent in moving the application for grant of time. This 
finally extended the time for achieving the Effective Date from 22.03.2022 to 
25.05.2022 (3rd extension).  
 
7. On 20.05.2022, Respondent No.1 obtained the Air Operation Certificate 
(hereinafter, the “AOC”) and asserted that all the Conditions Precedent 
required under Clause 7.6.1 of the Resolution Plan had been met and that the 
Effective Date in accordance with Clause 7.6.2 had been achieved. As a 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 29 of 168 
 
 
consequence, Respondent No.1 had 180 days from 20.05.2022 i.e., until 
16.11.2022 to infuse an amount of Rs. 350 Crore in the Corporate Debtor as 
per Clause 6.3.1(g) and the Implementation Schedule under Clause 7.7.1 of 
the Resolution Plan.  
 
8. The workmen and employees of the Corporate Debtor and several Operational 
Creditors challenged the order of the NCLT dated 22.06.2021 by which the 
Resolution Plan was approved before the NCLAT. Vide order dated 
21.10.2022, the NCLAT upheld the order of the NCLT dated 22.06.2021. 
However, it was observed that the workmen and employees are entitled to the 
payment of their full provident fund and gratuity which was unpaid as on the 
insolvency commencement date and that the balance of the above dues should 
be paid by the Successful Resolution Applicant i.e., Respondent No.1, in order 
to satisfy its statutory obligations. It was further stated that “Non-payment of 
full PF and Gratuity shall lead to violation of Section 30(2)(e) and hence, to 
save the plan, the above payments have to be made”. On 20.12.2022, 
Respondent No.1 preferred Civil Appeal Nos. 465-469 of 2023 against the 
aforesaid order dated 21.10.2022 passed by the NCLAT, before this Court.  
 
9. It is the case of Respondent No.1 that between May 2022 and October 2022, 
the Appellants disputed the fulfilment of the Conditions Precedent by 
Respondent No.1 on one ground or another. Therefore, on 18.10.2022, 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 30 of 168 
 
 
Respondent No.1 filed two Interim Applications – First, IA No. 3398 of 2022 
(hereinafter, “Implementation Application”) before the NCLT seeking 
necessary directions for the implementation of the Resolution Plan and a 
declaration that all the Conditions Precedent have been fulfilled; Second, IA 
No. 3508 of 2022 requesting that the period from 20.05.2022 till the date on 
which the Implementation Application would be decided by the NCLT be 
excluded for the purpose of calculating 180 days from the Effective Date, for 
the purpose of making the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore.  
 
10.  The NCLT allowed both the aforesaid IAs and vide its common order dated 
13.01.2023 held that all the Conditions Precedent have been duly complied 
with and therefore, 20.05.2022 would be the Effective Date. Further, it 
excluded the period from 20.05.2022 to 16.11.2022 (180 days) from the period 
of 180 days within which the first tranche payment had to be made, in the 
interests of justice and to achieve the primary objective of maximization of 
assets and resolution of the Corporate Debtor. As a consequence, the deadline 
to meet with the first tranche payment obligation of Rs. 350 Crore was 
extended till 15.05.2023 (hereinafter, “1st implementation extension”). The 
appellants challenged this common order dated 13.01.2023 passed by the 
NCLT before the NCLAT by way of Company Appeal (AT)(INS) Nos. 129-

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 31 of 168 
 
 
130 of 2023 (hereinafter, “Company Appeal”) and also sought a stay on the 
same.  
 
11. On 30.01.2023, this Court dismissed Civil Appeal Nos. 465-469 of 2023 filed 
by Respondent No.1 and upheld the order dated 21.10.2022 passed by the 
NCLAT. In such circumstances, Respondent No.1 was obliged to pay the full 
provident fund and gratuity that the workmen and employees were entitled to 
within 180 days from the Effective Date. 
 
12.  The NCLAT vide its order dated 03.03.2023, declined to stay the order dated 
13.01.2023 passed by the NCLT while observing that the steps regarding the 
implementation of the Resolution Plan have to be taken by the SRA which 
needs to be overseen by the Monitoring Committee. On 17.04.2023, the 
Appellants filed Civil Appeal Nos. 3736-3737 of 2023 before this Court 
against the order of the NCLAT declining the grant of stay. 
 
13.  Since 15.05.2023 was fixed as the deadline to make the first tranche payment 
of Rs. 350 crore, Respondent No.1, on 11.05.2023, filed IA Nos. 2028-2029 
of 2023 respectively before the NCLAT in the Company Appeal for the 
purpose of seeking exclusion of the period from 16.11.2022 till the time the 
Company Appeal is decided from the calculation of 180 days stipulated for 
the infusion of first tranche of funds under the Resolution Plan. Immediately 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 32 of 168 
 
 
thereafter, on 17.05.2023, IA Nos. 2059-2060 of 2023 in the Company Appeal 
were also filed by Respondent No.1 seeking to restrain the Appellants from 
encashing or appropriating the Performance Bank Guarantee and Earnest 
Money deposited by Respondent No.1 in favor of the Appellants under the 
Resolution Plan.  
 
14.  The NCLAT vide its common order dated 26.05.2023, stated that the period 
between 16.11.2022 and 03.03.2023 (107 days) be excluded from the 
calculation of 180 days for the infusion of first tranche of funds under the 
Resolution Plan and also held that the Appellants could invoke the PBG only 
with the leave of the NCLT. This, effectively, extended the period to infuse 
Rs. 350 Crore under the first tranche till 31.08.2023 (2nd implementation 
extension). Soon thereafter, on 13.06.2023, the Appellants filed Civil Appeal 
Nos. 4131-4134 of 2023 against the common order dated 26.05.2023 passed 
by the NCLAT.  
 
15.  On 16.06.2023, Respondent No. 1 filed two other IA Nos. 3789-3790 of 2023 
(hereinafter, “Gratuity Application”) in the Company Appeal requesting that 
they be allowed to discharge the gratuity claims of the employees and 
workmen of the Corporate Debtor in three tranches and also allow them to 
approach the EPFO authorities in order to reduce or waive off the claim 
towards damages amounting to Rs. 24.4 Cr imposed on the Corporate Debtor 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 33 of 168 
 
 
or grant permission to challenge the imposition of damages in an appeal before 
the appropriate authority.  
 
16. In the meantime, vide letter dated 27.07.2023, the Office of the Director 
General of Civil Aviation, Government of India (hereinafter, “DGCA”) 
extended the validity of the AOC issued to the Corporate Debtor until 
03.09.2023 subject to certain conditions. The relevant extracts from the letter 
are reproduced hereinbelow:

validity of AOC.  
 
2. In view of the fact that Jet Airways is still undergoing

17. While the Company Appeal was pending before the NCLAT, the Appellants 
filed an Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 (hereinafter, “Lender’s Affidavit”) 
before the NCLAT. The Lender’s Affidavit provided that, if Respondent No.1, 
firstly, infuses Rs. 350 Crore by 31.08.2023; secondly, complies with the 
payment obligations to the workmen and employees, and; thirdly, 
scrupulously follows the other terms and conditions of the Resolution Plan -  
the Appellants would not contest the issues relating to the grant of 
exclusion/extension of time as well as the issue relating to the compliance of 
all Conditions Precedent by the Respondent and would withdraw the 
Company Appeal pending before the NCLAT along with the Civil Appeals 
filed before this Court. The Lender’s Affidavit also provided that, upon failure 
to comply with the aforesaid conditions, the Corporate Debtor should be 
directed to go into liquidation. This opportunity was given to Respondent 
No.1/SRA as a one-time measure. Para 8 of the Lender’s Affidavit which 
stipulates these conditions is reproduced hereinbelow:  
“8. In the present appeal, the lenders are agreeable that in 
case; 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 35 of 168 
 
 
 
a) SRA infuses Rs. 350 Crores by 31.08.2023, the date by which 
said payment is to be made as per the Resolution Plan, read 
with Order dated 26.05.2023 passed by this Hon’ble 
Tribunal; and 
b) SRA Undertakes to scrupulously follow the other terms and 
conditions of the resolution plan and 
c)  SRA complies with the liabilities relating to payment to the 
employees as per order of NCLAT dated 21.10.2022 which 
has been upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its order 
dated 30.01.2023, 
the Lenders would not contest the issues relating to granting 
of exclusion/extension of time (in terms of the orders dt. 
13.01.2023 passed by NCLT and order dt. 26.05.2023 passed 
by this Hon’ble Tribunal) as well as on the issue relating to 
compliance of condition precedent by the SRA and 
accordingly undertakes to withdraw the present Company 
Appeal (AT) Ins 129-130 of 2023 which is pending 
adjudication before this Hon'ble Tribunal along with Civil 
Appeal Nos. 4131-34 of 2023 & 3736-37 of 2023 filed before 
the Hon'ble Supreme Court, on the said two issues. In other 
words, lenders would not contest the granting of exclusions 
as well as on the issue regarding the compliance of 
Conditions Precedent, in case the aforesaid steps are taken 
by SRA without any further delay. Failing to comply with the 
conditions mentioned in Para 8(a) to (c) above, the 
Corporate Debtor should be directed to go into liquidation.” 
 
18.  In response to the aforesaid Lender’s Affidavit, Respondent No.1 on 
18.08.2023 filed IA Nos. 3801 and 3802 of 2023 (hereinafter, “Adjustment 
application”) in the Company Appeal seeking inter alia – First, a direction 
to the Appellants to adjust the PBG of Rs. 150 Crore towards part payment of 
the first tranche under the Resolution Plan; second, to allow Respondent No.1 
to infuse Rs. 100 Crore as share application money on or by 31.08.2023 and; 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 36 of 168 
 
 
thirdly, to allow Respondent No.1 to infuse the remaining Rs. 100 Crore as 
share application money on or before 30.09.2023. Through these applications, 
Respondent No.1 further urged that, in the event the Gratuity Application was 
not allowed, the Resolution Plan would not be implemented and in such 
eventuality, the Appellants and the Corporate Debtor may be directed to 
refund all the amounts infused or deposited by Respondent No.1. including 
the share application money and the PBG.  
 
19. The NCLAT, vide its order dated 28.08.2023, partly allowed the Adjustment 
Application so far as the payment of the first tranche of Rs. 350 Crore was 
concerned and stated that as regards the prayer with respect to the Gratuity 
Application, the submissions required further consideration. The PBG of Rs. 
150 was allowed to be adjusted against the first tranche payment and the 
remaining Rs. 200 Crore was allowed to be infused on or by 31.08.2023 and 
30.09.2023 respectively. Therefore, the deadline to infuse the aforesaid 
amount and implement the Resolution Plan was further extended to 
30.09.2023 (3rd implementation extension).  Immediately thereafter, the 
Appellants filed Civil Appeal Nos. 6427-6428 of 2023 before this Court 
against the aforesaid order dated 28.08.2023 passed by the NCLAT.  
 
20. Meanwhile, on 03.09.2023, the conditional AOC issued by the DGCA came 
to an end. Before the expiry of the 3rd implementation extension i.e., 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 37 of 168 
 
 
30.09.2023, Respondent No. 1 had deposited an amount of Rs. 200 Crore. 
However, it is the case of the Appellants that the manner of infusion of the 
same was in contravention of the Resolution Plan, specifically Clause 2.1.5, 
since Respondent No.1 infused a portion of the funds through a third party, 
thereby inducting them into the Resolution Plan as a shareholder.  
 
21. Before this Court, the following three Interim Orders passed by the NCLAT 
came to be challenged by the Appellants over a period of time: 
 
i) 
Civil Appeal Nos. 3736-3737 of 2023 challenging the Interim Order 
dated 03.03.2023 passed by the NCLAT by which it declined to stay 
the NCLT Order dated 13.01.2023 which held that all the Conditions 
Precedent had been fulfilled; 
ii) 
Civil Appeal Nos. 4131-4134 of 2023 challenging the Interim Order 
dated 26.05.2023 passed by the NCLAT through which the NCLAT 
restrained the Appellants from invoking the PBG and extended the 
time for infusion of first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore up to 
31.08.2023; and 
iii) 
Civil Appeal Nos. 6427-6428 of 2023 challenging the Interim Order 
dated 28.08.2023 passed by the NCLAT allowing the PBG of Rs. 150 
Crore to be adjusted against the first tranche payment and allowing 
the remaining amount of Rs. 200 Crore to be infused by 30.09.2023.  

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 38 of 168 
 
 
22. All the aforementioned appeals were heard together and vide common 
judgment and order dated 18.01.2024, this Court held that the PBG cannot be 
permitted to be adjusted against the first tranche payment and therefore, 
directed that the amount of Rs. 150 Crore be infused in cash on or before 
31.01.2024 (4th implementation extension). In the event of failure by 
Respondent No.1 to infuse the said amount within the said date, this Court 
held that the consequences under the Resolution Plan would follow.  It 
disposed of the appeals as thus: 
“25. The lenders have argued in the appeals that there has 
been a failure on the part of the successful resolution 
applicant to comply with the conditions precedent. If the 
successful resolution applicant were to comply with the 
terms as envisaged in SBI's affidavit dated August 16, 2023, 
evidently issues pertaining to compliance with the conditions 
precedent were not to be pressed thereafter. In order to 
furnish this successful resolution applicant a final 
opportunity to comply and consistent with the above 
position, we issue the following directions: 
(i) The successful resolution applicant shall peremptorily on 
or before January 31, 2024, deposit an amount of Rs. 150 
crores into the designated account of SBI, failing which the 
consequences under the resolution plan shall follow; 
(ii) The performance bank guarantee of Rs. 150 crores shall 
continue to remain in operation and effect, pending the final 
disposal of the appeal before the National Company Law 
Appellate Tribunal, and shall abide by the final outcome of 
the appeal and the directions that may be issued by the 
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal; and 
(iii) Whether or not the successful resolution applicant has 
been compliant with all the conditions of the resolution plan 
as well as of the conditions set out in paragraph 8 of the 
affidavit dated August 16, 2023 shall be decided by the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 39 of 168 
 
 
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal in the pending 
appeal.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
23. Respondent No.1 failed to deposit Rs. 150 Crore in cash by 31.01.2024 as 
directed by this Court. Therefore, on 27.01.2024, Respondent No.1 filed Misc. 
Application Nos. 216-217 of 2024 in the Civil Appeal Nos. 6427-6428 of 2023 
seeking an extension of time for making the deposit of Rs. 150 Crore. The 
same was dismissed by us vide order dated 02.02.2024 as being misconceived 
in view of our previous order dated 18.01.2024. This order is reproduced 
hereunder:  
“ ORDER 
1. 
The Miscellaneous Application is misconceived in 
view of the final order passed by this Court on 18 January 
2024. 
2. 
The 
Miscellaneous 
Application 
is 
accordingly 
dismissed.  
3 Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.” 
 
24. Later, the NCLAT, vide its impugned order dated 12.03.2024, dismissed the 
Company Appeal filed by the Appellants against the order of the NCLT dated 
13.01.2023 while holding that Respondent No.1 had fulfilled all the 
Conditions Precedent and had also complied with all the other terms of the 
Resolution Plan. The following were the concluding observations in the 
impugned order of the NCLAT:  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 40 of 168 
 
 
“129. In view of our foregoing discussions and conclusions, 
we dispose of these Appeals in the following manner:  
 
1. The impugned order passed by the Adjudicating 
Authority dated 13.01.2023 is upheld.  
2. The Monitoring Committee and MC Lenders as well as 
SRA are directed to take steps for creation of charge 
over the Dubai Property No. 1, Dubai Property No. 2, 
and Dubai Property No.3 within a period of 30 days 
from today. The SRA to bear all necessary expenses for 
creation of necessary charge.  
3. The Performance Bank Guarantee of INR 150 Crores, 
which is lying with the Monitoring Committee/MC 
Lenders, shall be adjusted towards the first tranche 
payment of INR 350 crores as INR 200 crores have 
already been paid by the SRA. By adjustment of PBG 
as per the Resolution Plan, the first tranche of payment 
of INR 350 crores shall be completed.  
4. Steps shall be taken for re-constitution of the shares as 
per the Resolution Plan forthwith.  
5. Out of the first tranche payment of INR 350 crores, 
payments shall be made to the workmen and employees 
and the creditors as per the Resolution Plan, including 
the payment of CIRP cost as per the Resolution Plan, 
which payment shall be completed within 60 days from 
the date of this judgment.  
6. The SRA shall submit an Application for re-issue of Air 
Operation Certificate which may be obtained within 90 
days from the date of this judgment.  
7. The closing date shall be 90th day from the date of this 
judgment, on which date, handing over of the 
Corporate Debtor to the SRA by the Monitoring 
Committee shall be completed.  
8. Towards the payment of provident fund dues, as per the 
order dated 21.10.2022 passed by this Tribunal in 
Company Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) Nos. 643 of 2021, 
SRA has undertaken to make payment of provident fund 
upfront along with payment of dues of workmen and 
employees as per the Resolution Plan, which payment 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 41 of 168 
 
 
of INR 12 Crores as undertaken, shall be made in 
addition to the payments as directed above.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 
25. The aforesaid judgment and order of the NCLAT once again extended the time 
limit for implementation of the Resolution Plan and satisfaction of the first 
tranche payment obligation of Rs. 350 Crore to 11.04.2024 i.e., the date within 
which the creation of charge over the various Dubai properties was to be 
completed (5th implementation extension). The same charge has, admittedly, 
not been created as on date.  
 
26. In light of the above, the Appellants have challenged the aforesaid impugned 
order of the NCLAT dated 12.03.2024 by way of the present Civil Appeals 
filed under Section 62 of the IBC, 2016.  
 
B. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS  
 
27.  Mr. N. Venkataraman, learned ASG appearing for the Appellants broadly 
classified his submissions into the following issues:  
i. 
That the direction of the NCLAT in the impugned order dated 
12.03.2024  allowing Respondent No.1 to adjust the PBG of Rs. 150 
Crore towards the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore, runs counter 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 42 of 168 
 
 
to the judgement of this Court dated 18.01.2024. The Resolution plan 
mandates a cash infusion and the question of PBG adjustment would 
arise only when the three Dubai properties valued at Rs.250 crores are 
mortgaged by Respondent No.1. 
ii. 
That the NCLAT, through its impugned order dated 12.03.2024 
erroneously limited the Airport Dues to Rs. 25 Crore and further 
categorising it as a part of the CIRP costs especially when the 
Resolution Plan obligates an upfront payment of Rs. 475 Crore towards 
Airport Dues. Such an error is glaring since the Resolution Plan clearly 
excludes the Airport Dues from the ambit of CIRP costs.  
iii. 
That the NCLAT while approving the Resolution Plan vide its Order 
dated 21.10.2022 increased the workmen’s dues from Rs. 52 Crore to 
Rs. 289.2 Crore (which according to the appeals filed by the workmen 
would be reduced to Rs. 226 Crore post the demerger of the ground 
handling business). An appeal against the order stood dismissed by this 
Court on 30.01.2023. Therefore, it is a matter of concern that the 
impugned order of the NCLAT limited the workmen’s compensation 
to a mere Rs. 12 Crore which is contrary to its earlier order dated 
21.10.2022 as upheld by this Court on 30.01.2023. 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 43 of 168 
 
 
iv. 
Clause 7.6.1 of the Resolution Plan deals with the five Conditions 
Precedent and imposes an obligation on the SRA to fulfil the same in 
order to recommence the operations of the Corporate Debtor as an 
aviation company. The SRA could be said to have breached three of 
these conditions i.e. Condition (a) on obtaining the AOC; Condition (c) 
on obtaining the Slots Allotment Approval, and; Condition (d) on 
obtaining the International Traffic Rights Clearance. The NCLT, vide 
its order dated 13.01.2023 had held that the Conditions (a) and (c) stood 
fulfilled and amended Condition (d) which effectively transformed it 
from a condition precedent to a condition subsequent. Such erroneous 
findings came to be wrongly affirmed by the NCLAT through its 
impugned order dated 12.03.2024.  
 
i. 
Issue No.1: Adjustment of PBG of Rs. 150 Crore towards the first 
tranche payment  
 
28. As far as the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore is concerned, it was 
submitted that a payment of only Rs. 200 Crore in cash has been made and the 
SRA has failed to infuse the remaining Rs. 150 Crore in cash.  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 44 of 168 
 
 
29. The learned ASG submitted that Clause 6.3.1(g) relating to the “Infusion of 
Funds and Timelines” provides that the timeline for the infusion of the upfront 
first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore was within 180 days from the Effective 
Date.  The clause also indicates the manner in which the first tranche would 
be utilized and obligates a distribution pattern towards the CIRP costs, 
contingent fund, payments to FCs, OCs, other creditors and other 
stakeholders, working capital for business and miscellaneous administrative 
expenses. 
 
30. The learned ASG then elaborated on the scope of Clause 7.7 of the Resolution 
Plan which provides the “Implementation Schedule” and requires that the 
Resolution Plan be completed within 5 years from the Effective Date. 
According to this clause, the performance of different obligations was to be 
completed within the said corresponding timelines. S.No. 11 under this table 
specifically requires the infusion of Rs.350 Crore in the Corporate Debtor by 
the SRA within “Z+150 days” where “Z” represents the Effective Date.  The 
expression “infusion” has been interpreted by this Court vide its judgement 
dated 18.01.2024 to mean “payment in cash”.  
31. Reference was made by the learned ASG to the RFRP, more particularly to 
Clauses 3.13.1, 3.13.2, 3.13.7(iii) and 3.13.9 which mandate the execution of 
a PBG for an amount of Rs. 150 Crore and also provide that the PBG cannot 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 45 of 168 
 
 
be set-off against or used as a part of the consideration which the SRA 
proposes to offer in relation to the company even if expressly indicated as such 
in the successful Resolution Plan. It also provides for an automatic right to 
invoke the PBG without any reference to the SRA, should the SRA fail to 
implement the approved Resolution Plan in accordance with the terms of the 
Resolution Plan and to the satisfaction of the CoC. It was also submitted that 
vide Clauses 7.3 and 9.4 of the Resolution Plan respectively the spirit and 
intention of the RFRP stood translated into the Resolution Plan. Under Clause 
7.3 of the Resolution Plan, the SRA undertook to provide the PBG as per the 
RFRP and in compliance with Regulation 36B(4A) of the 2016 Regulations. 
Clause 9.4 of the Resolution Plan authorizes the invocation of the PBG in 
terms of the RFRP. 
32. The learned ASG submitted that Clause 6.4.4 of the Resolution Plan on 
“Treatment of Financial Creditors - Summary of payments and Security 
package” under its tabular column evidently conveys the mandate that the 
SRA is under an obligation to execute a mortgage over the three Dubai 
properties i.e., Property No. 1 valued at Rs. 100 Crore, Property No.2 valued 
at Rs. 100 Crore and Property No.3 valued at Rs. 50 Crore. The table provides 
that the date of creation of such security would be the Effective Date. This 
security had to be created at the cost of the SRA. Therefore, the SRA was 
obliged to not only infuse an amount of Rs. 350 Crore within 180 days of the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 46 of 168 
 
 
Effective Date, but also execute the mortgage of the three Dubai properties on 
the Effective Date. In other words, the Resolution Plan obligated the SRA to 
satisfy the following twin conditions for the PBG to be discharged – (a) 
infusing Rs. 350 Crore as the first tranche payment and (b) executing a 
mortgage on the three Dubai properties worth Rs. 250 Crore on the Effective 
Date. The learned ASG submitted that, it is not in dispute that the NCLT vide 
its order dated 11.04.2022 extended the time for achieving the Effective Date 
to 25.05.2022 and Respondent No.1 claimed to have achieved the same on 
20.05.2022. Consequently, all the three Dubai properties ought to have been 
mortgaged on or before 20.05.2022. 
33. It was submitted that the Respondent SRA failed to make the first tranche 
payment of Rs. 350 Crore despite the fact that it ought to have been infused 
within 6 months from 20.05.2022. Instead, the Respondent SRA continuously 
contended that the order of the NCLT dated 13.01.2023 (holding that the 
Conditions Precedent have been fulfilled) was challenged by the Appellants 
before the NCLAT and that they could not therefore bring in Rs. 350 Crore 
since the Effective Date had not yet materialized. 
34. It was submitted that the Appellants filed the Lender’s Affidavit dated 
16.08.2023 before the NCLAT and vide Para 8 of the Lender’s Affidavit, the 
Appellants agreed not to contest the issues relating to the grant of exclusion 
of time (granted by the Order of the NCLT dated 13.01.2023 and the NCLAT 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 47 of 168 
 
 
dated 26.05.2023) and the issue relating to the compliance with the Conditions 
Precedent. In the said affidavit, the Appellants also agreed to withdraw the 
Company Appeal pending before the NCLAT along with the Civil Appeal 
Nos. 4131-4134 of 2023 and Civil Appeal Nos. 3736-3737/2023 filed before 
this Court. However, this would be subject to the fulfilment of the three 
conditions imposed vide Para 8 by the SRA. The conditions were that – firstly, 
the SRA infuses an amount of Rs. 350 Crore by 31.08.2023 i.e., the date by 
which the said payment is to be made as per the Resolution Plan read with 
order dated 26.05.2023 passed by the NCLAT; secondly, the SRA undertakes 
to scrupulously follow the other terms and conditions of the Resolution Plan 
and; thirdly, the SRA complies with the liabilities in relation to the payment 
to be made to the employees as per the order of NCLAT dated 21.10.2022, 
which has been upheld by this Court vide order dated 30.01.2023 
35. It was submitted that in terms of Serial No. 11 under Clause 7.7.1 read with 
Clause 6.1.3(g), the SRA had to infuse cash amounting to Rs 350 Crore and it 
was for this reason alone that Para 8(a) of the Lender’s Affidavit refers 
specifically to the infusion of Rs. 350 crore in cash by 31.08.2023.  It was 
reiterated that the first tranche payment had to necessarily be made in cash 
since such a requirement flows from the Resolution Plan. It was not open to 
the SRA to contend that the Resolution Plan had a different mode of payment 
namely, the payment of Rs. 200 Crore in cash and Rs. 150 Crore by way of 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 48 of 168 
 
 
adjusting the PBG. The learned ASG contended that none of the clauses in the 
Resolution Plan stipulates such condition. To the contrary, under Clause 6.4.4, 
the PBG could be released or adjusted only upon the satisfaction of the twin 
requirements abovementioned. Therefore, the assumption by the Respondent 
that the infusion of Rs. 350 Crore emanates only out of the Lender’s Affidavit 
dated 16.08.2023, is totally incorrect. The Lender’s Affidavit has not and 
cannot impose any condition over and above those which are provided under 
the Resolution Plan. The Lender’s Affidavit was filed to only set out a 
deadline for infusing Rs. 350 Crore by 31.08.2023, which was subsequently 
extended by the order dated 28.08.2023 of the NCLAT to 30.09.2023. The 
Lender’s Affidavit only insisted on compliance with payment obligations 
within specified timelines and neither did it alter the Resolution Plan nor lay 
out new conditions. 
36. The NCLAT in its order dated 28.08.2023 fell in error in allowing the 
adjustment of PBG of Rs. 150 Crore as a part of the first tranche payment. 
This is evident from the order of this Court dated 18.01.2024, specifically 
under Para 21, wherein it was held that an infusion of Rs. 350 Crore would 
only mean an infusion by cash and the same could not be substituted for the 
adjustment of PBG. This Court, further, under Para 25 directed that a failure 
to make this payment on or before 31.01.2024 would necessitate the 
consequences under the Resolution Plan to follow. This Court further issued 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 49 of 168 
 
 
a direction that the NCLAT shall decide whether the SRA had been compliant 
with all the conditions contained in the Resolution Plan as well as the 
conditions in Clause 8 of the Affidavit dated 16.08.2023. This Court made it 
clear that the non-infusion of Rs. 150 Crore in cash would lead to 
consequences both in terms of the Affidavit and also the Resolution Plan since 
the condition insofar as infusion was concerned, remained the same both in 
the Affidavit and in the Resolution Plan. Therefore, the observation of the 
NCLAT in the impugned order holding that the consequences of non-deposit 
of Rs. 350 Crore was that “the SRA was not entitled to take any benefit of the 
offer” is contrary to the Resolution Plan and the order of this Court dated 
18.01.2024.   
37. This Court had directed a cash payment of Rs. 150 Crore on or before 
31.01.2024 and the SRA had admittedly failed to remit the same. Realizing 
that this would lead to the initiation of the consequences under the Resolution 
Plan, Respondent No.1 had applied for an extension before this Court which 
was declined outright as being misconceived vide order dated 02.02.2024. 
Therefore, the SRA having failed to make the payment and having breached 
this Court’s order dated 18.01.2024, the NCLAT ought to have concluded that 
the Resolution Plan had failed. 
38. In the alternative, the ASG argued that, assuming without admitting that the 
non-compliance of this Court’s Judgement dated 18.01.2024 would only have 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 50 of 168 
 
 
the consequence of bringing a closure to the offer made in the Lender’s 
Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 and not have any effect on the Appeal that was 
pending before the NCLAT, the NCLAT while passing it’s final order dated 
12.03.2024 ought to have insisted on the payment of Rs. 150 Crore in cash. 
That would have been in tune with the specific direction that was issued by 
this Court & the intent with which the direction was issued, and the SRA 
having not paid the same, had committed a breach of the Resolution Plan. The 
NCLAT went to the extent of swapping the conditions laid out in the 
Resolution Plan by directing the adjustment of the PBG first and the execution 
of the mortgage on the three Dubai properties later i.e., within 30 days from 
its order dated 12.03.2024. It was submitted that even the extension that was 
allowed for the execution of mortgage expired on 11.04.2024 and the SRA 
continues to be a defaulter in this regard as well.  
 
39. The ASG vehemently contended that, there has been a triple breach on the part 
of SRA – Firstly, breach of the Resolution Plan; secondly, violation of the 
directions issued by this Court dated 18.01.2024 and; thirdly, the failure to 
execute the mortgage of the three Dubai properties before 11.04.2024.  
 
40. The ASG submitted that the impugned order of the NCLAT dated 12.03.2024 
at Para 129, granted 30 days’ time to the SRA for the creation of charge over 
the Dubai properties and directed the SRA to bear all the necessary expenses. 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 51 of 168 
 
 
It was submitted that there was complete inaction on the part of the SRA for 
29 days from the date of the impugned order and on 10.04.2024 at 16:38 hours, 
the SRA sent an email stating that they are willing to proceed with the security 
creation of the Dubai properties and also informed that since its value had 
reduced by Rs. 14 Crore, they would bridge the gap with an additional 
property or a cash security. On the same date, another email was sent by the 
SRA at 17:18 hours stating that an account balance of Rs. 76.07 Lakh is 
available with the Appellants and the same may be used to execute the 
mortgage. The ASG submitted that the Appellants replied to the said 
communication on the same day at 19:18 hours stating that: 
(a) The assenting financial creditors on 13.10.2023 have appointed Mashreq 
Bank to act as the agent for creation of the mortgage in terms of the 
prevailing law in Dubai and the necessary amount required to be paid to 
them had not yet been received.  
(b) After the impugned order of the NCLAT came to be passed on 12.03.2024, 
the Appellants sent an email on 22.03.2024 regarding the cost for the 
creation of a mortgage over the properties located in Dubai, which had not 
been paid till date.  
(c) That, instead of remitting the amount for creation of security as already 
advised, the SRA was sending an email that it had “no objection with the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 52 of 168 
 
 
MC lenders immediately proceeding with the security creation of the 
Dubai properties”.  
(d) It was also brought to the notice of the SRA that 11.04.2024 would be the 
last date for complying with the impugned order of the NCLAT and that 
the SRA was well aware of the fact that the cost of creation of securities is 
Rs. 2,36,00,767 and not Rs. 76.07 lakh. This shows the SRA’s clear 
disinclination to execute the mortgage. It was further brought to the SRA’s 
notice that they had failed to comply with the Resolution Plan and the 
impugned order of the NCLAT dated 12.03.2024. 
 
Further, on the same day, at 21:05 hours, the SRA sent an email referring to 
12 acres of contiguous land situated in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh which had been 
valued in excess of Rs. 250 Crore, owned by a reputed individual entrepreneur 
resident in India and that the SRA was ready to offer this property as an 
alternative security in India. The Appellants replied to the said email on 
16.04.2024 and stated that the period of 30 days had already expired on 
11.04.2024, the expenses for creation of charge had not been paid and that 
accepting the property in India which belongs to a third party would 
tantamount to modification of the Resolution Plan.   
41. The ASG therefore submitted that the above exchanges patently bring out the 
SRA’s non-cooperation, defiance to judicial orders and desperate attempts to 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 53 of 168 
 
 
suggest the creation of security of unknown third-party properties, all of which 
were done after the expiry of the time period of 30 days provided by the 
NCLAT for compliance with their order dated 12.03.2024. Consequently, 
even in terms of the impugned Order of the NCLAT, there has been a total 
breach on the part of the SRA which only indicates that they have no 
inclination worth the name to implement the Resolution Plan. Consequently, 
in terms of Clause 9.4 of the Resolution Plan and Clause 3.13.7(iii) of the 
RFRP respectively, the Appellants are entitled to invoke the PBG 
automatically without any reference to the SRA.  
 
ii. 
Issue No. 2: Non-payment of Airport dues  
 
42. It was submitted that in terms of Clause 6.3.1(d), the airport dues and parking 
charges are to be paid by the SRA upfront in priority over any other payment 
to the creditors of the Corporate Debtor. Clause 6.4.1(f) provides that on 
31.08.2020, an approximate figure of Rs 240 Crore towards parking charges 
for aircrafts and airport space lease charges was arrived at through the estimate 
given by the RP and this was subject to a maximum of Rs. 475 Crore. Specific 
attention was drawn to the expression in Clause 6.3.1(d) which states that 
“such payments will be settled upfront in full in first 180 days from the 
effective date and without any conditions (including not being staggered 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 54 of 168 
 
 
payments spread across a period of time) so that flying can start immediately 
without any future disputes and concerns with such claimants for past dues”. 
The respondents, however, have not remitted any amount towards the airport 
dues nor have they allowed the Resolution Plan to be implemented. As a result 
of the several extensions/exclusions given by the NCLT and NCLAT to the 
SRA, the airport dues as on date stand at a staggering figure of Rs. 1100 Crore 
approx., which amount, again, is to be paid by the respondents alone.  
 
43. The ASG submitted that, when the aforesaid is the position in the Resolution 
Plan, the NCLAT in its impugned order dated 12.03.2024 vide Paras 53-55 
respectively has chosen to restrict the Airport dues to a mere Rs. 25 Crore and 
has erroneously construed it to be a part of the CIRP cost. The counsel drew 
specific attention to Para 53 of the impugned order wherein the NCLAT had 
referred to Clause 6.4.1(h) and stated that “…CIRP cost of the Corporate 
Debtor (excluding parking charges, rental charges, employees dues, taxes 
etc.) Accordingly, the Resolution Applicant has set aside a sum of Rs 25 crores 
as CIRP cost towards payment of any such cost until the approval date…”. 
Thus, despite the fact that Clause 6.4.1(h) on treatment of Outstanding CIRP 
Costs excludes the parking charges, rental charges, employees’ dues, taxes 
etc., the NCLAT has surprisingly read the same to mean as “inclusive 
of/included in” the CIRP costs while directing the payment of a mere Rs. 25 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 55 of 168 
 
 
Crore. Therefore, this is an error apparent on the face of it which requires 
interference by this Court. 
 
44. It was submitted that, in case the argument of the SRA that a maximum of 
only Rs. 475 Crore is to be paid by the SRA under the Resolution Plan, is 
accepted, then the entire amount of Rs. 475 Crore shall go towards the airport 
dues and as a consequence, nothing would become payable to the financial 
creditors, operational creditors, workmen etc. The amount of Rs. 240 Crore 
was a mere estimate of the dues payable in the year 2020. Due to non-payment 
and non-commencement of flying operations, the same amount in the year 
2024 has increased multi-fold. To contend that such an increased amount does 
not fall under the Resolution Plan and therefore, is not payable, will cast a 
further burden on the CoC of the Corporate Debtor. Further, it would be unfair 
to accept that, for the reason of the Respondent’s default in payment, the CoC 
would have to bear the Airport dues of Rs. 1100 Crore and none of the 
creditors or workmen would get anything out of this plan. This misconceived 
contention which intentionally makes the plan unworkable needs to be 
outrightly rejected. 
 
iii. 
Issue No. 3: Non-payment of Workmen and Employees’ dues  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 56 of 168 
 
 
45. The ASG submitted that the Resolution Plan originally provides for a sum of 
Rs. 52 Crore towards the payment of workmen’s and employees’ dues. 
However, the NCLAT vide its order dated 21.10.2022, in Para 78, had 
increased the same to Rs. 289.2 Crore which now stands modified to about 
Rs. 226 Crore. The NCLAT in the order dated 21.10.2022 under Para 80 had 
observed in unambiguous terms that “the workmen are entitled to full payment 
of provident fund and gratuity, hence the balance of above dues ought to be 
paid by the SRA to satisfy statutory obligations. Non-payment of full provident 
fund and gratuity shall lead to violation of Section 30(2)(e) and hence, to save 
the Plan the above payments have to be made”. This view of the NCLAT had 
also been upheld by this Court vide its order dated 30.01.2023. The Resolution 
Plan under Clause 6.3.1(c) obligates the payment of such dues within 180 days 
from the Effective Date. 
 
46. It was submitted that, the NCLAT, vide Paras 111-114 had erroneously 
directed the payment of an amount of Rs. 12 Crore towards the Provident 
Fund and has completely ignored the payment of dues pertaining to gratuity 
of the workmen and employees. The Appellants contend that this finding is 
not only an error apparent but completely inconsistent with the NCLAT’s 
own earlier order dated 21.10.2022, which stood upheld by this Court on 
31.01.2023.  

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 57 of 168 
 
 
 
iv. 
Issue No. 4: Achievement of Effective Date 
 
47. It was submitted that Clause 7.6.2 of the Resolution Plan provided that the 
date of fulfilment of all the Conditions Precedent as stated in Clause 7.6.1, 
shall be the Effective Date for the purposes of the Resolution Plan. A failure 
to fulfill the Conditions Precedent within 270 days of the Approval Date 
would lead to an automatic withdrawal of the Resolution Plan as per Clause 
7.6.4. However, the NCLT, vide its order dated 22.06.2021, expressed its 
opinion that there was uncertainty with respect to the achievement of the 
Effective Date under the Resolution Plan and therefore, modified Clause 7.6.4. 
As a consequence, it fixed the Effective Date to be the 90th day from the 
Approval Date of 22.06.2021 and stated that this could be extended for a 
maximum period of another 180 days. The Effective Date, therefore, became 
22.09.2021 i.e., 90 days from 22.06.2021. Subsequently, three extensions 
were given to the SRA with respect to the achievement of the Effective Date 
– First, vide order dated 29.09.2021, the NCLT extended it to 22.12.2021; 
Secondly, vide order dated 20.01.2022, the NCLT extended to 22.03.2022 
through which the maximum extension of 270 days that could be provided 
under the Resolution Plan had been reached and; Thirdly, vide order dated 
11.04.2022, the NCLT further extended it to 25.05.2022 by excluding a period 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 58 of 168 
 
 
of 65 days spent in moving the application for grant of time. Therefore, the 
Effective Date was finally frozen on 25.05.2022.  
 
48. The learned ASG submitted that the SRA, however, contended that the 
Effective Date had been achieved on 20.05.2022 and the same was accepted 
by the NCLT in its order dated 13.01.2023. Therefore, the calculation of 180 
days for the infusion of the First Tranche Payment begins from 20.05.2022. 
The initial 180 days had expired on 16.11.2022. However, several extensions 
were given to the SRA for infusion of the first tranche payment – Firstly, vide 
order dated 13.01.2023, the NCLT extended the timeline for infusion of First 
Tranche Payment till 15.05.2023; Secondly, vide order dated 26.05.2023, the 
NCLAT further extended the timeline of 180 days till 31.08.2023; Thirdly, 
vide order dated 28.08.2023, the NCLAT extended the timeline of 180 days 
till 30.09.2023 and; Fourthly, vide Order dated 18.01.2024, this Court 
extended the time of 180 days for infusion till 31.01.2024.  
 
49. The learned ASG highlighted that Respondent No.1 had failed to make the 
first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore, airport dues of Rs. 475 Crore and the 
workmen’s and employees’ dues of Rs. 226 Crore within the initial 180 days 
from the Effective Date as well as within the multiple extensions granted by 
the NCLT, NCLAT and this Court. The ASG submitted that multiple 
extensions and accommodations have already been granted to the SRA for 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 59 of 168 
 
 
implementation of the Resolution Plan. Therefore, it is too late in the day to 
claim that the non-infusion of Rs. 150 Crore to complete the first tranche 
payment of Rs. 350 Crore is only a breach of the Lender’s Affidavit dated 
16.08.2023 and not the Resolution Plan. The same needs to be rejected 
outrightly. 
 
v. 
Issue No. 5: Non-fulfilment of Conditions Precedent   
 
50. The ASG submitted that the respondents have failed to comply with 3 
Conditions Precedent, specifically under Clauses 7.6.1(a), (c) and (d) of the 
Resolution Plan respectively. 
 
51. It was submitted that Clause 7.6.1 (a) requires the SRA to obtain an AOC 
which has to be validated by the DGCA and the Ministry of Civil Aviation 
(hereinafter, “MoCA”). The Respondent possessed an AOC on 20.05.2022 
i.e., the Effective Date as contended by the SRA. The validity of the AOC was 
further extended by the DGCA on 27.07.2023 up to 03.09.2023 subject to 
certain conditions. It was clearly stated that the extension is only for the 
limited purpose of completing the ongoing CIRP process and the Corporate 
Debtor would be required to undergo fresh re-certification in accordance with 
the prescribed procedure for issuance of an AOC and also submit a firm action 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 60 of 168 
 
 
plan for the revival of its operations. The AOC expired on 03.09.2023 and the 
same was never extended by the SRA.  
 
 
52. It was submitted that the NCLT in its order dated 13.01.2023 had recorded a 
finding that the Condition Precedent with respect to the AOC was fulfilled but 
it must be noted that this was an observation made during a time when the 
SRA had a valid subsisting AOC, which subsequently expired.  
 
53. It was further submitted that vide letter dated 26.12.2023, the Director General 
of Civil Aviation confirmed that no further extension of the AOC was granted 
to the Corporate Debtor beyond 03.09.2023. The NCLAT in its impugned 
order dated 12.03.2024 required the SRA to submit an application for re-
issuance of the AOC within 90 days from the date of its order and the deadline 
for the same had expired on 12.06.2024.  It was submitted that, even today, 
the Respondents do not have a valid AOC and the fact that the Respondents 
are contending that they had not renewed the AOC solely because of the matter 
being under litigation, only exposes their disinterest and disinclination in 
taking their obligations forward.  
 
54. It was then submitted that Clause 7.6.1(c) requires the SRA to obtain Slot 
Allotment Approval. The NCLT in its order dated 13.01.2023 vide para 124 
had clearly rendered a finding that “there is no dispute that slots for which 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 61 of 168 
 
 
SRA applied were granted to them by the concerned competent authority 
including the slots in Delhi and Mumbai on settling the old dues and as such, 
it cannot be considered as non-allotment of slots, as SRA has received the 
slots it requested for in compliance with the plan approval order.” The ASG 
also referred to the email dated 27.06.2022 issued by MAIL and the same 
reads as under: “We are happy to consider your request for slots on parking 
bay during the ongoing summer schedule. The same is subject to the closure 
of ongoing discussions pertaining to settlement of outstanding dues of jet 
airways towards MAIL.” 
 
55. While the NCLT had correctly recorded a finding that the slot allotment is 
subject to the payment of airport dues (which the Respondents had not paid 
even today), the NCLAT vide para 50 and Para 55 erroneously concluded that 
“the adjudicating authority has rightly observed that settling of old dues 
cannot be considered as non-allotment of slots” and therefore condition 
7.6.1(c) stands fulfilled. This finding is contrary to the finding recorded by 
NCLT and the Resolution Plan and as a consequence, the Respondents could 
be said to have breached this condition precedent as well. 
 
56. The ASG submitted that Clause 7.6.1(d) requires the SRA to obtain the 
International Traffic Rights Clearance. The NCLT, vide Para 125, had righty 
held that “the international traffic rights clearance is required to be obtained 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 62 of 168 
 
 
in compliance with the applicable laws which stipulates that minimum 20 
aircrafts are required to be deployed before applying for such clearance”. 
However, after holding so, the NCLT proceeded to conclude that this 
condition cannot be satisfied upfront and can be fulfilled only when the 
operations have recommenced successfully and that, therefore, this condition 
precedent stood fulfilled. In simple terms, the NCLT could be said to have 
modified a condition precedent to a condition subsequent and this view of the 
NCLT has been upheld by the NCLAT in Paras 56 to 58. These findings are 
in clear contradiction to the express stipulation in the Resolution Plan and 
therefore, this condition too stands breached by the respondents. 
 
57. One more aspect that the learned ASG highlighted through his submissions 
was that, the Circular F.No.AV.14027/17/2018-AT-1 issued by the Office of 
Director General of Civil Aviation provides certain requirements for 
undertaking aerial work. Para 6 of the said Circular deals with Security 
Clearance and the same requires the Applicant or Company and its Board of 
Directors to obtain Security Clearance from the Ministry of Home Affairs 
(MHA) if they are foreign nationals. It was submitted that according to the 
communications dated 09.07.2024 issued by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, it 
had been confirmed that Security Clearance had not been conveyed in respect 
of Mr. Florian Fritsch.  Hence, the threshold requirement of security clearance 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 63 of 168 
 
 
has not yet been obtained by one of the Resolution Applicants, who according 
to Clause 2.1.4 of the Resolution Plan, is the other partner to the Consortium 
along with Mr. Murari Lal Jalan. The ASG also placed reliance on news items 
which suggested that Mr. Florian Fritsch is facing money laundering 
proceedings in three different jurisdictions. The same had been dealt with by 
the NCLAT summarily in its impugned order in Para 125.  However, it was 
wrongly concluded that this was yet another attempt by the Appellants to 
create roadblocks in the process of implementation of the Resolution Plan.  
 
58. The counsel finally submitted that, since the Airport Dues and the CIRP costs 
have substantially increased solely on account of the delay, the Court should 
invoke its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India and direct that 
the Corporate Debtor be sent to liquidation. 
 
 
C. 
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 
59. On the other hand, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel appearing on 
behalf of Respondent No.1 submitted that Section 62 of the IBC, 2016 requires 
an appeal to the Supreme Court from an order of the NCLAT to be on a 
“question of law”. He submitted that the present appeal only seeks to 
challenge the concurrent findings of fact recorded by the NCLT and the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 64 of 168 
 
 
NCLAT, with regard to compliance of the Conditions Precedent by the SRA 
and does not bring out any question of law. To fortify this submission, the 
counsel placed reliance on the decision of this Court in IFCI Ltd. v. Sutanu 
Sinha and Others reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1529.  
 
60.  The counsel submitted that the directions issued by this Court vide order dated 
18.01.2024 were interim and not final. The appeals which were decided by 
this Court arose out of an interlocutory application which was filed by the 
SRA seeking directions from the NCLAT on the mode of satisfying the 
conditions in the Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023. It was submitted that 
the same is evident from a reading of Para 19 which reads that “.. Observations 
in the present judgment are confined to the arrangement which must operate 
during the pendency of the appeal without the court expressing a final view 
on merits of the appeal, which will fall for consideration before the NCLAT”. 
Further, Para 21 of the same order stated that, “…The impugned order of the 
NCLAT, on the other hand, allowed the plea of the SRA for adjustment and 
consequential release of the PBG at the interlocutory stage. This prima facie 
would not be in accordance with the tenor of paragraph 8 of the affidavit…”. 
Therefore, it was submitted that the directions issued by this Court only related 
to a scenario were the SRA sought benefit of the offer made in the Lender’s 
Affidavit.  

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 65 of 168 
 
 
 
61.  The counsel submitted that the NCLAT in its impugned order dealt with this 
Court’s order dated 18.01.2024 at length and concluded that the direction 
issued by this Court to deposit the amount of Rs. 150 Crore peremptorily on 
or before 31.01.2024 was in reference to the Lender’s Affidavit dated 
16.08.2023. Meaning thereby, the order of the NCLAT dated 28.08.2023 to 
adjust the PBG of Rs. 150 Crore was substituted by the direction of the 
Supreme Court. Therefore, the SRA would render itself disentitled to take 
benefit of the offer of the Appellant that they would withdraw the Company 
Appeal and the appeals before the Supreme Court. As such, the pending 
Company Appeal was to be heard on merits and decided in accordance with 
law by the NCLAT. In short, the entire issue before this Court was confined 
to an interpretation as to how the condition of Rs. 150 Crore in the affidavit 
was to be interpreted and if the condition was complied with, the Appeals 
would stand withdrawn, if not, they would be decided on their own merits.  
 
62. It was further submitted that the NCLAT rightly observed that, the submission 
of the Appellant that the Corporate Debtor should be directed to be liquidated 
on account of non-deposit of Rs. 150 Crore, cannot be accepted since the 
Supreme Court neither considered nor expressed any opinion on the question 
of liquidation. Liquidation was never recorded as a consequence and this is 
evident from liquidation not being mentioned in; (a) the arguments of the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 66 of 168 
 
 
Appellants recorded by the NCLAT in its order dated 28.08.2023, (b) the 
judgment of the NCLAT dated 28.08.2023, (c) the arguments of the 
Appellants recorded by this Court in its order dated 18.01.2024 and, the 
findings or the directions of this Court in its order dated 18.01.2024.  
 
 
63. The counsel also submitted that the adjustment of the PBG against the first 
tranche payment was possible under the Resolution Plan, specifically under 
Clause 6.4.4 which sets out the “Summary of payments and security package”. 
It is evident through Clause 6.4.4 that a revolving package was agreed against 
each tranche of the payment under the Resolution Plan. For the first tranche 
of payment, the security package comprises of the PBG and one of the Dubai 
Properties and it is stated that the PBG will be adjusted against the first tranche 
payment. For subsequent tranches of payment, the security package does not 
include the PBG and instead includes other types of security. It was submitted 
that the Lenders are relying on the RFRP to claim that no adjustment of the 
PBG was possible. However, the RFRP is only a wish list of the CoC which 
was informed to the applicants at the time of inviting plans. Therefore, it 
cannot override a negotiated and approved provision of the Resolution Plan. 
This is precisely why the approved Resolution Plans often deviate from the 
RFRP.  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 67 of 168 
 
 
64. The counsel submitted that according to Clause 6.4.4 of the Resolution Plan, 
the Balance Security is in the form of immovable properties located in Dubai 
and since they are located outside India, the approval of the RBI was necessary 
for the creation of security. The security on the Dubai properties of the SRA 
was to be created on the Effective Date, i.e., 20.05.2022. On 21.05.2022, a day 
after the Effective Date, the SBI had applied for the approval and the same 
was received on 22.07.2022.  
 
65. It was submitted that, on 03.02.2023 the SRA had shared drafts of the 
transaction documents required for the creation of security. However, no 
comments were received from the Appellants. It is the case of the SRA that 
the Appellants did not reply to the reminder emails sent between the months 
of May and October 2023 and this issue was also discussed during the 37th 
MC Meeting dated 09.10.2023. However, after more than a year of sharing 
the transaction documents, the Appellants sent their comments on the same on 
08.04.2024 i.e., three days before the expiry of the 30-day timeline given 
under the impugned order of the NCLAT.  
 
66. It was further submitted that, only in the 42nd MC Meeting that took place on 
02.04.2024 the SRA was informed for the first time that, as per the recent 
valuation, the valuation of the Balance Security worked out at Rs. 236 Crore 
and that there was a shortfall of Rs. 14 Crores. In the same meeting, the SRA 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 68 of 168 
 
 
suggested that a property in India valued at Rs. 250 Crore could be provided 
as an alternate security. Vide email dated 10.04.2024, the SRA provided 
details of the alternate security equivalent to Rs. 250 Crore in India. However, 
the Appellants responded to the above vide their email dated 16.04.2024 
stating that providing an alternate security would tantamount to modification 
of the Resolution Plan.  
 
67. The counsel submitted that the SRA, vide email dated 16.04.2024 conveyed 
that they had not received any invoice from Mashreq Bank towards payment 
of their costs for acting as an agent for security creation and that the payment 
of security related costs to the extent of Rs. 76 Lakh could be done from the 
existing deposit with the Appellants. For the balance amounts, they requested 
that the invoices be shared with the SRA and that the same would be processed 
immediately. On 20.04.2024 and 01.05.2024 respectively, the SRA reminded 
the Appellants to share the invoices for the purpose of security creation.  
 
68. On the issue of security creation, the counsel summed up submitting that the 
SRA had done everything within its control to enable the Appellants to create 
security including agreeing to bear all costs and expenses for creation and 
preservation of security, providing contracts for such security creation, and 
providing title documents of all the immovable properties to the Appellants. 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 69 of 168 
 
 
Therefore, the contention that the SRA failed to create Balance Security is 
factually incorrect.  
 
69. With respect to the payment of the Airport Dues, it was submitted that, the 
Resolution Plan provides for the adjustment of CIRP dues from the positive 
cash balance of the Corporate Debtor and then from the share of the Lenders. 
The Appellants’ own case is that the Airport Dues amount to Rs. 1000 Crore 
approximately. Therefore, as per the Resolution Plan, Rs. 400 Crore approx. 
is payable towards the airport dues, first, from the positive cash balance of the 
Corporate Debtor and if that is insufficient, then from the Lenders’ share being 
CIRP Dues. Finally, the remaining Rs. 600 Crore would be borne by the SRA 
 
70. As regards the payment of Provident Fund and Gratuity to the workmen and 
employees, it was submitted that the NCLAT did not waive off the liability of 
the SRA towards the payment of PF and Gratuity. On the contrary, for the 
implementation of the same, the NCLAT had provided timelines for making 
such payments in compliance with the applicable laws. It was further 
submitted that in the 42nd MC meeting held on 02.04.2024, the SRA undertook 
to make the payment towards the dues of PF and gratuity and the Appellants 
are aware of the same.  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 70 of 168 
 
 
71. The counsel submitted that there are concurrent findings on the fulfillment of 
Conditions Precedent vide the order of the NCLT dated 13.01.2023 and the 
impugned order of the NCLAT dated 12.03.2024. Clause 7.6.1 of the 
Resolution Plan sets out five Conditions Precedent. It was submitted that two 
of the five Conditions Precedent were “admittedly complied” with. On the 
remaining three, both the Tribunals have rendered concurrent findings, which 
ought not to be interfered with in an appeal under Section 62 of the IBC, 2016, 
which is effectively a Second Appeal.  
 
72. The counsel submitted that the SRA cannot suo moto infuse funds into the 
Corporate Debtor since such infusion necessarily requires steps/actions to be 
taken by the Appellants and the Corporate Debtor acting through the MC. 
These steps include the appointment of directors on the board of the Corporate 
Debtor and seeking in-principal approval from the relevant stock exchanges 
under the SEBI LODR Regulations by the Corporate Debtor. However, 
despite constantly following up with the Appellants, the same has not been 
received yet and therefore, they have not allowed the SRA to undertake such 
a funding.  
 
73. The Counsel submitted that the first Condition Precedent is the Validation of 
AOC by DGCA and MoCA as provided under Clause 7.6.1(a). The SRA had 
a valid AOC until 03.09.2023 and the lapse of the AOC during the pendency 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 71 of 168 
 
 
of the appeals cannot mean that the Condition Precedent was not met. It was 
submitted that the condition was met on the date of the implementation 
application being filed before the NCLT and that the AOC has not been 
renewed only due to the fault of the Appellants.  
 
74. It was submitted that the third Condition Precedent was the requirement of 
Slot Allotment Approval as provided under Clause 7.6.1(c). The counsel 
rejected the contention of the Appellants that the slots were not provided 
because the airport charges were not paid and stated that the airport charges 
are a part of the CIRP costs which could be met as and when the Resolution 
Plan was operationalized. It was further submitted that the SRA had obtained 
48 slots on the Effective Date when it was supposed to secure only 46 slots. 
The NCLT in its order dated 21.06.2022 had also held that it was not possible 
for the SRA to obtain the slots that were historically available to the Corporate 
Debtor. Therefore, this Condition Precedent has also been met.  
 
75. The counsel submitted that the fourth Condition Precedent related to obtaining 
the International Traffic Right Clearance as stated under Clause 7.6.1(d) of 
the Resolution Plan. This Condition Precedent had to be satisfied in 
accordance with the “applicable laws”. Upon applying for the Clearance, the 
MoCA had informed the SRA that, Clause 8(b) of the National Civil Aviation 
Policy, 2016 requires a minimum of 20 aircrafts to be deployed for domestic 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 72 of 168 
 
 
operations before applying for international clearance and that therefore, the 
same can be granted when 20 aircrafts of the Corporate Debtor are in 
operation. The Business Plan only envisages 6 aircrafts and the SRA can 
operationalize 20 aircrafts once the operations of the Corporate Debtor begin. 
This is evident from Clause 8.2.6(f) that states that the restart of international 
operations can be envisaged only after the completion of 12 months of 
operating the airline. Since this condition requires operations to re-commence 
before it can be satisfied, this Condition Precedent has also been complied 
with.  
 
76. Mr. Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned senior counsel also appearing for the 
Respondents, concurred with all the aforesaid submissions made on behalf of 
the SRA. In addition to bringing our attention to Clause 6.4.4 on the issue of 
adjustment of the PBG, he also referred to Clause 6.4.12 of the Resolution 
Plan which stated that the PBG will bring financial flexibility for the SRA and 
help the SRA to advance the committed payments and achieve its goal of re-
commencing the operations of the Corporate Debtor at the earliest.  
 
77. It was submitted that the NCLAT order dated 28.08.2023 rightly recognized 
that Regulation 36B(4A) of the 2016 Regulations only provides for the PBG 
requirement for the purposes of the RFRP and the same has been complied 
with by the SRA. Further, the counsel pointed out that Clause 6.4.4 (a)(i) 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 73 of 168 
 
 
elaborates on the “Committed Cash Payments” to be made to the Financial 
Creditors. In the table, under the heading “Date of release of Security”, the 
PBG of Rs. 150 Crore was not mentioned while the other two forms of security 
find a mention. Thus, the intention was that, the PBG be adjusted in making 
the first tranche payment.  
 
78. The counsel further submitted that there is no specific consequence provided 
under the Resolution Plan for a default in the creation of security. It was 
reiterated that the SRA had undertaken all possible steps to further the 
execution of the mortgage of the Dubai properties as per the Resolution Plan 
and it is the Appellants who have not cooperated in this regard.   
 
79. The counsel submitted that the Appellants have taken contradictory stances at 
different stages of the dispute before different forums. Before the NCLAT in 
its pending Company Appeal, it was contended by the Appellants that the 
NCLT had erroneously allowed the Resolution Plan to be implemented 
without the complete compliance of the Conditions Precedent by the SRA. 
However, before this Court, they have argued that the SRA has claimed that 
the Conditions Precedent were fulfilled on 20.05.2022 and has asserted that it 
would be the Effective Date. As a consequence, the SRA should have met with 
their first tranche payment obligations within 180 days from the Effective 
Date.  

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 74 of 168 
 
 
 
80. The counsel submitted that the consequences of non-compliance with the 
Conditions Precedent were that the SRA would not be able to re-commence 
operations as an aviation company as stated in Clause 7.6.1 of the Resolution 
Plan. He also submitted that the Effective Date for the purposes of the 
Resolution Plan would only kick in upon the fulfillment of all the Conditions 
Precedents. The consequence of non-compliance with the Conditions 
Precedent would be that the Resolution Plan shall automatically stand 
withdrawn and upon, such withdrawal, the members of the SRA in the MC 
shall resign and the remaining members of the MC shall assume absolute 
control of the Corporate Debtor.  
 
81.  Adding to the submissions as regards the Airport Dues, it was submitted that 
as per the estimates made by the RP, the airport dues i.e., the parking charges 
and airport space lease charges were Rs. 240 Crore and this was reflected in 
Clause 6.4.1(f) of the Resolution Plan. It was submitted that the dues accrued 
during the period of CIRP i.e., till the date of approval of the Resolution Plan, 
is a part of the CIRP costs and such payments have to be made within 170 
days from the Effective Date as per Clause 6.4.1 of the Resolution Plan. As 
per Clause 6.4.1(h), a sum of Rs. 25 Crore was set aside for CIRP costs. 
However, it must be noted that Clause 6.4.1(m) allows the SRA to utilize the 
funds available with the Corporate Debtor for making payments of any portion 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 75 of 168 
 
 
of the CIRP costs. It was submitted that the Lenders rely on Clause 6.3.1(d) 
to state that the airport dues have to be settled upfront and not in staggered 
payments. However, Clause 6.3.1(d) is just a proposal and not a condition of 
the Resolution Plan.  
 
82.  On workmen and employees’ dues, it was submitted that, as per Clause 6.4.2 
on the “Summary of Financial Proposal” the amount demarcated for all the 
claims related to employees or workmen was Rs. 52 Crore and as per the 
Implementation Schedule, these claims were to be paid within 175 days from 
the Effective Date. However, the NCLAT vide its order dated 21.10.2022 
increased it to Rs. 113 Crore since it was the minimum liquidation value that 
they were entitled to as per the estimates of the RP. The final directions issued 
by the NCLAT in the aforesaid order conveyed that the workmen and 
employees are entitled to the payment of unpaid PF and gratuity till the 
Insolvency Commencement Date and the RP was directed to compute such 
payment within 30 days. The RP had calculated such amounts to be Rs. 14 
Crore towards PF and Rs. 188.7 Crore towards gratuity. It was submitted that 
neither the NCLAT order dated 21.10.2022 nor the order of this Court dated 
30.01.2023 had provided any specific timelines for fulfillment of these 
additional liabilities which were cast upon the SRA. This is precisely why the 
SRA proposed to pay Rs. 14 Crore towards PF upfront in compliance with 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 76 of 168 
 
 
Section 11 of the PF Act and pay the Gratuity dues of Rs. 188.2 Crore in a 
staggered manner.  
83. The counsel finally referred to the letter dated 16.08.2024 sent by MoCA 
which provided Security Clearance in respect of a proposed Director of the 
Corporate Debtor, Mr. Swapnil Jain. The validity period of this Security 
Clearance was stated to be co-terminus with the validity period of the AOC 
which was issued by the DGCA.  
 
 
D. ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION  
84. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone 
through the materials on record, the following questions of law fall for our 
consideration: -  
i. 
Whether the Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG) could have been 
adjusted against the first tranche payment which was to be made under 
the Resolution Plan, within 180 days from the Effective Date, in 
contravention of the order of this Court dated 18.01.2024, the terms of 
the Resolution Plan and the provisions of law? To put it in other words, 
whether the impugned order of the NCLAT allowing the adjustment of 
the Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG) in lieu of payment of the first 
tranche could be said to be perverse? 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 77 of 168 
 
 
ii. 
Whether the non-implementation of the Resolution Plan by the SRA 
necessarily leads to the consequence of liquidation as provided under 
Section 33(3) of the IBC, 2016? 
iii. 
Whether the timely implementation of the Resolution Plan is also one 
of the objectives of the IBC, 2016?  
 
E. ANALYSIS  
85.  Before we proceed to advert to the rival submissions canvassed on either side 
and the issues outlined above, we must look into the preliminary objection 
raised on behalf of the SRA i.e., that the scope of an appeal under Section 62 
of the IBC must be restricted to a “question of law”. In this regard, reliance 
was placed on the decision of this Court in IFCI Ltd. v. Sutanu Sinha and 
Others reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1529 which dealt with the issue as 
to whether compulsorily convertible debentures could be treated as a “debt” 
instead of an equity instrument, to submit that the jurisdiction under Section 
62 is restricted to a question of law akin to a second appeal. The relevant 
observations are reproduced hereinbelow:  
“29. Last but not the least, we must also note that our 
jurisdiction comes from section 62 of the Code. The said 
section reads as under: 
“62. (1) Any person aggrieved by an order of the 
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal may file an 
appeal to the Supreme Court on a question of law 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 78 of 168 
 
 
arising out of such order under this Code within forty-
five days from the date of receipt of such order”. 
30. The jurisdiction is restricted to a question of law akin to 
a second appeal. The law does not envisage unlimited tiers 
of scrutiny and every tier of scrutiny has its own parameters. 
Thus, the lis inter se the parties has to be analysed within the 
four corners of the ambit of the statutory jurisdiction 
conferred on this court. 
31. We are thus of the view that the appeal does not raise any 
such question of law and that the findings of the courts below 
are in accordance with settled principles.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
86.  Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 is the provision related to a 
second appeal and it reads as thus:  
“100. Second appeal – (1) Save as otherwise expressly 
provided in the body of this Code or by any other law for the 
time being in force, an appeal shall lie to the High Court 
from every decree passed in appeal by any Court 
subordinate to the High Court, if the High Court is satisfied 
that the case involves a substantial question of law. 
(2) An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate 
decree passed ex parte. (3) In an appeal under this section, 
the memorandum of appeal shall precisely state the 
substantial question of law involved in the appeal.  
(4)Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial 
question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate that 
question.  
(5)The appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated 
and the respondent shall, at the hearing of the appeal, be 
allowed to argue that the case does not involve such 
question: 
Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to 
take away or abridge the power of the Court to hear, for 
reasons to be recorded, the appeal on any other substantial 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 79 of 168 
 
 
question of law, not formulated by it, if it is satisfied that the 
case involves such question.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
87. This Court in Chandrabhan (Deceased) Through Lrs. And Others v. 
Saraswati and Others reported in 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1273 explained as 
to what constitutes a “substantial question of law” under Section 100 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The relevant observations made are 
reproduced hereinbelow:  
“33. The principles relating to Section 100 of the CPC 
relevant for this case may be summarised thus: 
(i) An inference of fact from the recitals or contents of a 
document is a question of fact. But the legal effect of the 
terms of a document is a question of law. Construction of a 
document involving the application of any principle of law, 
is also a question of law. Therefore, when there is 
misconstruction of a document or wrong application of a 
principle of law in construing a document, it gives rise to a 
question of law. 
(ii) The High Court should be satisfied that the case involves 
a substantial question of law, and not a mere question of law. 
A question of law having a material bearing on the decision 
of the case (that is, a question, answer to which affects the 
rights of parties to the suit) will be a substantial question of 
law, if it is not covered by any specific provisions of law or 
settled legal principle emerging from binding precedents and 
involves a debatable legal issue. A substantial question of 
law will also arise in a contrary situation, where the legal 
position is clear, either on account of express provisions of 
law or binding precedents, but the court below has decided 
the matter, either ignoring or acting contrary to such legal 
principle. In the second type of cases, the substantial 
question of law arises not because the law is still debatable, 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 80 of 168 
 
 
but because the decision rendered on a material question, 
violates the settled position of law. 
(iii) The general rule is that the High Court will not interfere 
with findings of facts arrived at by the courts below. But it is 
not an absolute rule. Some of the well-recognised exceptions 
are where (i) the courts below have ignored material 
evidence or acted on no evidence; (ii) the courts have drawn 
wrong inferences from proved facts by applying the law 
erroneously; or (iii) the courts have wrongly cast the burden 
of proof. When we refer to “decision based on no evidence”, 
it not only refers to cases where there is a total dearth of 
evidence, but also refers to any case, where the evidence, 
taken as a whole, is not reasonably capable of supporting the 
finding.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
This Court recapitulated that a substantial question of law would also arise in 
a situation where the legal position is clear, either on account of express 
provisions of law or binding precedents, but the Court below has ignored or 
acted contrary to such legal principles while deciding the matter. In such 
circumstance, the decision rendered by the Court below would violate a settled 
position of law and therefore, constitute a substantial question law. 
Furthermore, it was observed therein that it is not an absolute rule that the 
Court in a second appeal will not interfere with findings of fact. One of the 
well-recognized exceptions is where the Courts below have drawn wrong 
inferences from proved facts, by applying the law erroneously.  
88.  In Maria Colaco and Another v. Alba Flora Herminda D’souza and Others 
reported in (2008) 5 SCC 268, it was held that in the second appeal under 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 81 of 168 
 
 
Section 100 CPC, the High Court should not interfere on the questions of fact. 
However, if on a scrutiny of the evidence, it is found that the finding recorded 
by the first appellate court is totally perverse then an interference is certainly 
possible in the matter as it constitutes a question of law. The relevant 
observations are reproduced hereinbelow:  
 
“7. The learned Single Judge after considering the matter 
found that these averments did not constitute the basis on the 
part of the plaintiff that he was not in possession of the suit 
property. On the contrary, the learned Single Judge found in 
reply to Para 13 of the plaint that the defendants in their 
written statement admitted that the work was stopped by 
Defendant 1 for some time but they restarted the work again. 
This, according to the learned Single Judge was a proof of 
the fact that Defendants 1 and 2 and Defendant 3 were not 
sure about the possession and right of Defendants 1 and 2 
over the property. In fact, what transpires from all these facts 
is that the trial court reached the same conclusion as the 
learned Single Judge in second appeal in the High Court. It 
is true normally that in the second appeal the High Court 
should not interfere on the questions of fact. But if on the 
scrutiny of the evidence it is found that the finding recorded 
by the first appellate court is totally perverse then certainly 
the High Court can interfere in the matter as it constitutes 
the question of law.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
 
89. In Abdul Raheem v. Karnataka Electricity Board and Others reported in 
(2007) 14 SCC 138, the Court acknowledged that the High Court’s 
jurisdiction in terms of Section 100 is limited. Having said so, it was also 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 82 of 168 
 
 
observed that a consideration of irrelevant facts, non-consideration of relevant 
facts and a finding of fact arrived at by overlooking vital documents would 
also give rise to a substantial question of law. The relevant observations are 
reproduced hereinbelow:  
“10. A substantial question of law ordinarily would not arise 
from the finding of facts arrived at by the trial court and the 
first appellate court. The High Court's jurisdiction in terms 
of Section 100 of the Code is undoubtedly limited. 
 
11. The question as to whether the plaintiff was ready and 
willing to perform its part of contract by itself may not give 
rise to a substantial question of law. Substantial question of 
law should admittedly be formulated relying on or on the 
basis of findings of fact arrived at by the trial court and the 
first appellate court. 
12. However, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that 
consideration of irrelevant fact and non-consideration of 
relevant fact would give rise to a substantial question of law. 
Reversal of a finding of fact arrived at by the first appellate 
court ignoring vital documents may also lead to a substantial 
question of law. In Vidhyadhar v. Manikrao [(1999) 3 SCC 
573] this Court held : (SCC p. 586, para 23) 
“23. The findings of fact concurrently recorded by the 
trial court as also by the lower appellate court could not 
have been legally upset by the High Court in a second 
appeal under Section 100 CPC unless it was shown that 
the findings were perverse, being based on no evidence or 
that on the evidence on record, no reasonable person 
could have come to that conclusion.” 
(See also Iswar Bhai C. Patel v. Harihar Behera [(1999) 3 
SCC 457] .) 
14. We may, however, notice a few decisions in regard to the 
jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 100 of the Code. 
In Commr. of Customs (Preventive) v. Vijay Dasharath 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 83 of 168 
 
 
Patel [(2007) 4 SCC 118] this Court held : (SCC p. 128, 
paras 22-26) 
“22. We are not oblivious of the fact that the High Court's 
jurisdiction in this behalf is limited. What would be 
substantial question of law, however, would vary from 
case to case. 
23. Moreover, although, a finding of fact can be interfered 
with when it is perverse, but, it is also trite that where the 
courts below have ignored the weight of preponderating 
circumstances and allowed the judgment to be influenced 
by inconsequential matters, the High Court would be 
justified in considering the matter and in coming to its 
own 
independent 
conclusion. 
(See Madan 
Lal v. Gopi [(1980) 4 SCC 255] .) 
24. The High Court shall also be entitled to opine that a 
substantial question of law arises for its consideration 
when material and relevant facts have been ignored and 
legal principles have not been applied in appreciating the 
evidence. Arriving at a decision, upon taking into 
consideration irrelevant factors, would also give rise to a 
substantial question of law. It may, however, be different 
that only on the same set of facts the higher court takes a 
different view. (See Collector of Customs v. Swastic 
Woollens (P) Ltd. [1988 Supp SCC 796 : 1989 SCC (Tax) 
67] and Metroark Ltd. v. CCE [(2004) 12 SCC 505] .) 
25. Even in a case where evidence is misread, the High 
Court would have power to interfere. (See W.B. 
Electricity Regulatory Commission v. CESC Ltd. [(2002) 
8 SCC 715] and also Commr. of Customs v. Bureau 
Veritas [(2005) 3 SCC 265] .) 
26. In Dutta Cycle Stores v. Gita Devi Sultania [(1990) 1 
SCC 586] this Court held : (SCC p. 587, para 4) 
‘4. Whether or not rent for the two months in question 
had been duly paid by the defendants is a question of 
fact, and with a finding of such fact, this Court does not 
ordinarily interfere in proceedings under Article 136 of 
the Constitution, particularly when all the courts below 
reached the same conclusion. But where the finding of 
fact is based on no evidence or opposed to the totality 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 84 of 168 
 
 
of evidence and contrary to the rational conclusion to 
which the state of evidence must reasonably lead, then 
this Court will in the exercise of its discretion intervene 
to prevent miscarriage of justice.’ 
(See also P. Chandrasekharan v. S. Kanakarajan [(2007) 
5 SCC 669] .)”. 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
 
Therefore, what would constitute a substantial question of law would differ 
in each case. When material and relevant facts have been ignored and legal 
principles have not been applied while appreciating the evidence, a substantial 
question of law can be said to have arisen. Additionally, even in a case where 
evidence is misread, the power to interfere under Section 100 would exist. 
 
90. In our considered view the impugned order of the NCLAT directing the SRA 
to adjust the PBG of Rs. 150 Crore against the first tranche payment of Rs. 
350 Crore was in flagrant disregard of the order of this Court dated 
18.01.2023, the terms of the Resolution Plan and established law.  Such an 
order was perverse for having not properly considered several material and 
relevant facts and misreading evidence as well. Furthermore, the non-infusion 
and payment of funds in compliance with the applicable laws and the terms of 
the Resolution Plan had led to circumstances causing a failure of the 
Resolution Plan. We have no doubt in our mind that the NCLAT acted 
contrary to the settled legal principles and went to the extent of drawing wrong 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 85 of 168 
 
 
inferences from proved facts while deciding the matter. This itself justifies the 
examination of various issues in exercise of the jurisdiction afforded to us 
under Section 62 of the IBC, 2016.  
i. 
Whether the Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG) could have been 
adjusted against the first tranche payment which was to be made 
under the Resolution Plan, within 180 days from the Effective Date, in 
contravention of the order of this Court dated 18.01.2024, the terms of 
the Resolution Plan and the provisions of law?  
 
  
a. Whether the Conditions Precedent were fulfilled by Respondent 
No.1/SRA and the Effective Date was fixed at 20.05.2022? 
 
91. Clause 7.6.1 of the Resolution Plan details five Conditions Precedent that have 
to be fulfilled by the SRA. They are: - (a) Validation of AOC, (b) Approval of 
Business Plan, (c) Slot Allotment Approval, (d) International Traffic Rights 
Clearance, and (e) Demerger of AGSL. Of the five Conditions Precedent that 
find mention under Clause 7.6.1 of the Resolution Plan, the Appellants have 
only disputed the fulfilment of three Conditions Precedent i.e., Validation of 
AOC, Slots Allotment Approval and International Traffic Rights Clearance. 
According to Clause 7.6.2 of the Resolution Plan, the date of fulfillment of all 
the Conditions Precedent as stated in Clause 7.6.1 would be the Effective Date 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 86 of 168 
 
 
for the purposes of the Resolution Plan. A failure to fulfil the Conditions 
Precedent within a maximum of 270 days from the date of approval of the 
Resolution Plan would lead to an automatic withdrawal of the Resolution Plan 
as per Clause 7.6.4.  
 
92. On 22.06.2021, the NCLT had given its imprimatur to the Resolution Plan that 
was submitted by the SRA and this was the Approval Date i.e., “Y” as per the 
Implementation Schedule set out under Clause 7.7 of the Resolution Plan. The 
SRA had to fulfil the five Conditions Precedent within a period of 90 days, 
that was extendable to an additional 180 days i.e., 270 days in total. This 
period expired on 22.03.2022. However, the same was extended vide order 
dated 11.04.2022 by the NCLT until 25.05.2022, by allowing an exclusion of 
65 days.  
 
93. Upon receiving the AOC from the relevant authorities on 20.05.2022 i.e., 
within the extended time period as allowed by the NCLT, the SRA asserted 
that the Effective Date had been achieved. The SRA had approached the 
NCLT seeking a declaration from the Tribunal that all the Conditions 
Precedent have been met and that the SRA be allowed to begin the 
implementation of the Resolution Plan. Vide order dated 13.01.2023, the 
NCLT held that all the Conditions Precedent had indeed been met and that 
20.05.2022 would be considered as the Effective Date for the purposes of 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 87 of 168 
 
 
implementation of the Resolution Plan. The findings of the NCLT in the 
aforesaid order are reproduced hereinbelow:  
“Findings: 
122. […] However, having considered the rival submissions 
and on perusal of record with regards to satisfactory 
compliance of conditions precedent (CPs) it is noted that 
there is no dispute so far as satisfactory compliance of CPs 
at serial no. (i) and (v) as per approved plan i.e.:- (i) 
Validation of Air Operator Certificate by Directorate 
General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and Ministry of Civil 
Aviation (MoCA) and (v) Approval of demerger of ground 
handling business into all capital AGSL. 
 
In this background we have thus considered if the remaining 
three CPs are duly complied with by the applicant or 
otherwise. 
 
123. As regards to CP No. 2 i.e. Submission and approval of 
business plan to DGCA and MoCA: The business plan was 
submitted to above Authorities to fulfil compliance of 
DGCA’s Show Cause Notice (SCN) to CD of April 2019. 
SCN states that Air Operator Certificate will be issued after 
MoCA approves the business plan. Thus, with issuance of Air 
Operator Certificate, it is implied that the business plan has 
been approved. Even otherwise, guidelines for issuance of 
Air Operator Certificate being CAP 3100 clearly states that 
the DGCA will review the detailed business plan of the 
Applicant before issuance of Air Operator Certificate and 
with issuance of Air Operator Certificate there is implied 
approval of MoCA. In the background of above we find that 
this CP is satisfactorily complied with the issuance of AOC. 
 
124. As regards to CP No. 3 i.e. Slots Allotment Approval: It 
is noted that plan approval order of this Tribunal dated 22nd 
June, 2021 stipulates that no historic slots will be granted to 
Corporate Debtor or SRA. Admittedly, there is no challenge 
to this order thereby accepting the fact that old slot cannot 
be reinstated. Accordingly, this CP needs to be read with 
plan approval order, where Corporate Debtor shall be 
provided with such slots for which it applies. There is no 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 88 of 168 
 
 
dispute that slots for which SRA applied were granted to 
them by the concerned Competent Authority including the 
slots in Delhi and Mumbai, on settling the old dues and as 
such it cannot be considered as non-allotment of slots, as 
SRA has received the slots it requested for in compliance 
with plan approval order. The SRA cannot get all previous 
slots as this condition needs to be read with plan approval 
order of this Tribunal. In that view of the matter, above CPs 
is also found to be Satisfactorily complied with. 
 
125. As regards to CP no. 4: International Traffic Right 
Clearance: On perusal of the plan approval order dated 
22nd June, 2021, it is found that no blanket approval can be 
granted upfront to the SRA as it has to approach the 
concerned authorities for grant of such approval as per 
applicable laws. As already stated above, the plan approval 
order has reached its finality, thus, accepting the fact that all 
the approval issued upfront cannot be reinstated. 
Accordingly, this condition precedent needs to be read with 
plan approval order. Even otherwise there is no dispute that 
under the approved plan, SRA has to re-commence with 
operation of six aircrafts. The International Traffic Rights 
clearance is required to be obtained in compliance with the 
applicable laws which stipulates that minimum twenty 
aircrafts are required to be deployed before applying for 
such clearance. In view of this, we find that this condition 
cannot be satisfied upfront and needs to be satisfied in 
compliance with applicable laws i.e., after the SRA has 
twenty aircrafts in operation which can only be achieved 
once 
the 
operation 
is 
re-commenced 
successfully. 
Accordingly, this condition can only be fulfilled after the 
SRA/Applicants re-commences its business and not prior to 
its commencement. 
 
It goes without saying that plan approved by this Tribunal 
has to be implemented without any modification much less 
than on satisfaction of any other undertaking and thus, the 
effective date and completion date of condition precedent 
under the plan shall have to be read as 20th May, 2022. 
 
126. In the background of above facts and for the reasons 
stated above we hold that in addition to CPs (I) & (V) which 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 89 of 168 
 
 
are admittedly complied, remaining CPs (II), (III), (IV) are 
also duly complied.” 
 
94. During the period when the aforesaid order of the NCLT was passed, the SRA 
possessed a valid AOC and therefore, there was no dispute pertaining to this 
Condition Precedent. With respect to the Slot Allotment Approval, the NCLT 
observed that although the historic slots which were available to the Corporate 
Debtor could not be obtained by the SRA, yet the slots for which the SRA had 
applied were granted to it by the concerned authorities upon settling the old 
dues and as such, this could not be considered as non-allotment of slots. 
Therefore, this Condition Precedent was found to be satisfactorily complied 
with. As regards the Condition Precedent on obtaining International Traffic 
Rights Clearance, the applicable law required a minimum of 20 aircrafts to be 
deployed before applying for such a clearance. However, under the approved 
Plan, the SRA had to re-commence with the operations with only six aircrafts. 
It was, therefore, held that this Condition Precedent could not have been 
satisfied upfront and could only be satisfied once the operations of the 
Corporate Debtor had commenced successfully. With such observation, this 
Condition Precedent was also found to be duly complied with. The NCLT 
noted that the plan which was approved vide the Plan approval order dated 
22.06.2021 had to be implemented without any modification and thus the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 90 of 168 
 
 
Effective Date i.e., the date of completion of the Conditions Precedent under 
the Resolution Plan should be read as 20.05.2022.  
 
95. The Appellants filed a statutory appeal against the order of the NCLT dated 
13.01.2023 before the NCLAT and also sought a stay on the same. However, 
the grant of stay was declined by the NCLAT on 03.03.2023. This should have 
closed the debate on the understanding between the parties that the Effective 
Date was set in stone.  
 
96.  The NCLAT also vide its impugned order held that the SRA had fulfilled all 
the required Conditions Precedent. On Slot Allotment Approval, it was held 
that 48 slots have been obtained by the SRA for the recommencement of 
operations. The contention of the Appellants that airport charges are required 
to be paid upfront for obtaining such slots was rejected since the NCLAT was 
of the opinion that the payment towards airport charges, which are a part of 
CIRP costs, must be made as per the terms of the Resolution Plan when its 
implementation had begun. Therefore, it was declared that the Condition 
Precedent on Slot Allotment Approval was fulfilled despite the non-payment 
of Airport Dues by the SRA. On International Traffic Rights Clearance, the 
NCLAT echoed the opinion of the NCLT that it could not have obtained this 
clearance without commencing and amplifying the operations of the 
Corporate Debtor. It was observed that this Condition Precedent should not 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 91 of 168 
 
 
come in the way of the implementation of the Resolution Plan. As regards the 
AOC, it was contended by the Appellants that the same had lapsed after 
03.09.2023 and no extension was granted by the DGCA thereafter. However, 
the NCLAT was of the view that the AOC was valid on the date when the 
SRA had approached the NCLT for a declaration that the Conditions 
Precedent were fulfilled and also when the order dated 13.01.2023 of the 
NCLT was passed. The expiry of the validity period of the AOC during the 
pendency of the Company Appeal was not considered sufficient grounds to 
hold that the Condition Precedent was not fulfilled. The NCLAT while 
reaffirming that all the Conditions Precedent were satisfactorily fulfilled 
observed that there was no infirmity in the order of the NCLT dated 
13.01.2023. The NCLAT further directed the SRA to make an application for 
the re-issuance of the AOC within 90 days from the date of its order i.e., by 
12.06.2024.  
 
97.  The nature of the Conditions Precedent laid out under the Resolution Plan 
were such that several of them could not be fulfilled before the 
operationalization of the Corporate Debtor. The assertion that the Effective 
Date would kick in only upon fulfilment of all the Conditions Precedent and 
since the Appellants had challenged the fulfilment of the Conditions 
Precedent, such a date could not be said to have yet arrived, cannot be 
accepted. The order of the NCLT dated 22.06.2021 approving the Resolution 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 92 of 168 
 
 
Plan had fixed the Effective Date as the 90th day from the Approval date, 
which was subject to a maximum extension of another 180 days. It 
consciously removed the ambiguity that plagued Clauses 7.6.2 and 7.6.4 
respectively for the precise reason & with the idea that the Effective Date 
should not be endlessly postponed. Agreeing to such an erroneous proposition 
would mean that the Effective Date would never be achieved as long as the 
parties are litigating before the Courts and the SRA would be absolved of 
taking the implementation under the Resolution Plan further.  The NCLAT 
had declined to stay the order of the NCLT dated 13.01.2023 which held that 
all the Conditions Precedent were fulfilled. Further, on a perusal of the 
impugned order, it is evident that the NCLT and NCLAT rendered concurrent 
findings of fact that the SRA had fulfilled all the Conditions Precedent. In 
other words, it was repeatedly declared by different fora that the Effective 
Date was frozen on 20.05.2022 and the obligation of the SRA to implement 
the Resolution Plan was absolute. All steps necessary should have been 
undertaken by the SRA, at least post the impugned order of the NCLAT dated 
12.03.2024. To contend that its hands were tied since the Conditions Precedent 
were still being challenged before this Court is nothing but a reflection of the 
mala fide intention on the part of the SRA to not fulfil its obligations in 
accordance with the Resolution Plan under the garb of pendency of litigation. 
Such an undue delay cannot be permitted, especially in light of the intention 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 93 of 168 
 
 
of the IBC, 2016 to ensure a successful and time-bound revival of the 
Corporate Debtor. This places a higher obligation on the SRA to act in an 
expeditious manner.  
 
b. Whether the NCLAT could have directed the Performance Bank 
Guarantee (PBG) to be adjusted against the first tranche payment 
which was to be made within 180 days of the Effective Date?   
 
98. There is no dispute to the fact that the Effective Date was frozen on 
20.05.2022. Therefore, as per Clause 6.3.1(g) on the “Infusion of Funds and 
Timelines”, and Serial No.11 under Clause 7.7, the first tranche payment of 
Rs. 350 Crore had to be made by the SRA, upfront, within a period of 180 
days from the Effective Date i.e., 20.05.2022. As per the Resolution Plan, this 
180-day timeline otherwise would have expired on 16.11.2022. Several 
extensions were granted to the SRA to infuse this amount, at different stages 
of this litigation, by the NCLT, the NCLAT and this Court as well - First, by 
the NCLT vide order dated 13.01.2023, by which the timeline for infusion of 
first tranche payment was extended till 15.05.2023; Secondly, by the NCLAT 
vide order dated 26.05.2023, where the timeline of 180 days was further 
extended up to 31.08.2023; Thirdly, again by the NCLAT vide order dated 
28.08.2023, where the timeline of 180 days was extended up to 30.09.2023; 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 94 of 168 
 
 
and Fourthly, by this Court vide order dated 18.01.2024, whereby the time of 
180 days for infusion was extended up to 31.01.2024.   
 
I. 
The adjustment of the PBG was impermissible under the terms of the 
Resolution Plan read with Regulation 36B(4A) of the 2016 
Regulations. 
 
99. It is the case of the SRA that as per Clause 6.4.4 on the “Treatment of 
Financial Creditors” and the table adduced under the heading “Summary of 
payment and security package”, the PBG of Rs. 150 Crore could have been 
adjusted against the payment of the first tranche. It was submitted that in the 
last column of the table, the “Date of Release of Security” is provided. In the 
very first head in the column on date of release of security, the expression 
“PBG adjusted” has been mentioned against the first tranche of cash payment 
to be made to the Financial Creditors. Further, in the explanation given to the 
said table under Clause 6.4.4(a)(i), against the heading “Date of Release of 
Security”, there is no mention of the PBG while the other two types of security 
find a mention. It was submitted that the only good reason for this exclusion 
was the understanding that the PBG was adjustable against the obligation of 
the SRA towards payment of the first tranche. Further, it is the case of the 
SRA that since a revolving security package was agreed to under Clause 6.4.4, 
other types of security were envisioned for the subsequent tranches of 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 95 of 168 
 
 
payment and therefore, no issue could have been raised in adjusting the PBG 
towards the first tranche. However, we find it extremely difficult to agree with 
the stance of the SRA for multiple reasons which are detailed below.  
 
100. The RFRP under Clause 3.13 deals with the Performance Security to be 
given by the SRA. Clause 3.13.1 provides that the SRA shall furnish or cause 
to be furnished, an unconditional and irrevocable PBG, of an amount of Rs. 
150 Crore in favor of the SBI within 7 days of being declared as the SRA. 
Clause 3.13.2 provides that the PBG shall be valid, till the later of (a) a period 
of 180 days from the date of the PBG; and (b) the date of completion of the 
implementation of the Resolution Plan, as determined by the RP and the CoC. 
Clause 3.13.7 provides that the PBG can be invoked or appropriated at any 
time by the SBI, without any reference to the SRA, upon the occurrence of 
any of the following conditions;  
 
i. 
If any of the conditions under the Letter of Intent or the Resolution Plan 
are breached; 
ii. 
If the SRA fails to re-issue or extend the PBG in accordance with the terms 
of the RFRP; or  
iii. 
Failure of the SRA to implement the Resolution Plan to the satisfaction of 
the CoC, and in accordance with the terms of the Resolution Plan.  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 96 of 168 
 
 
Clause 3.13.8 provides that the PBG shall be returned to the SRA within a 
period of 7 days, upon 100% completion of the implementation of the 
Resolution Plan by the SRA. Finally, Clause 3.13.9 states in categorical terms 
that, the PBG shall not be set-off against or used as part of the consideration 
that the SRA proposes to offer in relation to the Corporate Debtor, even if 
expressly indicated as such by the SRA in the Resolution Plan.  
101. It is of vital importance that the aforementioned clauses of the RFRP are 
read conjointly with Clauses 7.3 and 9.4 of the Resolution Plan. Clause 7.3 of 
the Resolution Plan deals with the “Compliance with respect to Regulation 
36B(4A)” and states that the SRA undertakes to provide the PBG as per the 
terms of the RFRP in favor of the SBI within 7 days of it being declared as the 
SRA. Clause 9.4 of the Resolution Plan is titled “Implementation” and states 
that “the performance guarantee provided by the Resolution Applicant can be 
invoked in accordance with the terms of the RFRP”. Therefore, it is as clear 
as a noonday that the terms of the RFRP, particularly in relation to the 
performance security i.e., PBG, stood incorporated in the Resolution Plan by 
way of Clauses 7.3 and 9.4 respectively of the Resolution Plan.  
 
102. Furthermore, in the Covering Letter adduced with the Resolution Plan, the 
SRA stated as thus:  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 97 of 168 
 
 
“4. We hereby undertake that we, and our Representatives, 
shall at all times, be in compliance with the provisions of the 
RFRP, the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the IB Code and the 
CIRP Regulations.  
 
xxx  
 
 
 
xxx 
 
 
 
 xxx  
 
c. Acceptance  
We hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agree and accept 
the terms of the RFRP and that the decision made by the 
Resolution Professional, CoC and/or the Adjudicating 
Authority in respect of any matter with respect to, or arising 
out of, the RFRP and the Resolution Plan Submission 
Process shall be binding on us… 
 
xxx  
 
 
 
xxx 
 
 
 
 xxx  
 
10. We confirm that we have not taken any deviations so as 
to be deemed non-responsive with respect to the provisions 
of the RFRP, the IB Code and the CIRP Regulations.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
A bare reading of the above also strengthens the conclusion that the SRA has 
to remain compliant with the terms of the RFRP, at all times, in addition to 
being obedient to the terms of the Resolution Plan. Therefore, to say that the 
RFRP was merely a wish list of the CoC which was informed to the applicants 
at the time of inviting plans is incorrect, to say the least. The provisions of the 
RFRP, especially those provisions related to the Performance Security or 
PBG, were binding on the SRA.  
 
103.  The learned counsel for the SRA tried to place reliance on one another 
Clause of the Resolution Plan i.e., Clause 6.4.12 which stated that the PBG 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 98 of 168 
 
 
would bring financial flexibility and help the SRA to advance certain committed 
payments. This according to the SRA is an affirmation of the fact that the PBG 
could have been adjusted against the first tranche payment. However, it must be 
pointed out that Clause 6.4.12 was amended vide an Addendum to the 
Resolution Plan dated 02.10.2020. The erstwhile Clause 6.4.12 of the 
Resolution Plan reads thus:  
“6.4.12. Request for the consideration of the CoC - The 
Resolution Applicant shall provide a performance security 
bank guarantee for a total sum of Rs. 47.5 Crores, which will 
bring financial flexibility for the Resolution Applicant and 
help the Resolution Applicant advance the committed 
payments and achieve its goal of re-commencing the 
operations of Jet Airways at the earliest.” 
 
However, the aforesaid Clause 6.4.12 of the Resolution Plan was deleted in its 
entirety and replaced with the following:  
 “6.4.12. Request for the consideration of the CoC - As 
required under the RFRP, the Resolution Applicant shall 
provide the performance security bank guarantee (“PBG”) 
for a total sum of Rs. 150 Crores. The PBG will be provided 
in two parts, with the first PBG of Rs. 47.5 Crores provided 
within 7 (seven) days from the date of receipt of LOI; and 
PBG for the remaining sum of Rs. 102.5 Crores provided on 
the Effective Date.” 
 
A reading of the amended Clause 6.4.12 of the Resolution Plan indicates that 
the parties had mutually agreed to do away with the phrase “which will bring 
financial flexibility for the Resolution Applicant and help the Resolution 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 99 of 168 
 
 
Applicant advance the committed payments and achieve its goal of re-
commencing the operations of Jet Airways at the earliest”. What can be 
plainly deduced from such a deletion is that the PBG cannot be used by the 
SRA to advance any payments that are required to be paid under the scheme 
of the Resolution Plan. This, additionally, cements the idea that the PBG could 
not be adjusted towards any consideration or payment which had to be made 
by the SRA. Such an amendment in Clause 6.4.12 only brought the Resolution 
Plan further in line with the terms of the RFRP.  
104. An adjustment of the PBG against the first tranche payment would also be 
in violation of Regulation 36B(4A) of the 2016 Regulations which was 
inserted by Notification No. IBBI/2019-20/GN/REG040 dated 24.01.2019. 
The same is reproduced hereinbelow:  
“(4A) The request for resolution plans shall require the 
resolution applicant, in case its resolution plan is approved 
under sub-section (4) of section 30, to provide a performance 
security within the time specified therein and such 
performance security shall stand forfeited if the resolution 
applicant of such plan, after its approval by the Adjudicating 
Authority, fails to implement or contributes to the failure of 
implementation of that plan in accordance with the terms of 
the plan and its implementation schedule.  
 
Explanation I. – For the purposes of this sub-regulation, 
“performance security” shall mean security of such nature, 
value, duration and source, as may be specified in the 
request for resolution plans with the approval of the 
committee, having regard to the nature of resolution plan 
and business of the corporate debtor.  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 100 of 168 
 
 
Explanation II. – A performance security may be specified in 
absolute terms such as guarantee from a bank for Rs. X for 
Y years or in relation to one or more variables such as the 
term of the resolution plan, amount payable to creditors 
under the resolution plan, etc.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
105. Regulation 36B(4A) states that the performance security shall stand 
forfeited if the resolution applicant fails to implement or contributes to the 
failure of implementation of the plan, in accordance with the terms of the 
Resolution Plan and its implementation Schedule. Therefore, the PBG had to 
be kept alive until the complete implementation of the Resolution Plan as per 
Regulation 36B(4A) as well. This is also what is provided under Clauses 
3.13.2 and 3.13.8 of the RFRP respectively wherein the PBG was required to 
be kept alive and was to be returned to the SRA only upon 100% completion 
of the implementation of the Resolution Plan. This binding nature of the RFRP 
was transferred onto the Resolution Plan through Clauses 7.3 and 9.4 
respectively of the Resolution Plan.  
 
106.  The NCLAT in one of its orders i.e., the order dated 26.05.2023, had 
restrained the Appellants from invoking the PBG without the leave of the 
NCLT. While saying so, the following observations were made;  
 
“19. When the Resolution Plan of the Corporate Debtor has 
received approval up to Hon’ble Supreme Court and the 
Monitoring Committee is constituted under the Plan to 
oversee implementation, the Monitoring Committee has to 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 101 of 168 
 
 
act as a facilitator for implementation of the Resolution Plan 
instead of finding fault and taking steps, which does not 
facilitate 
the 
implementation, 
rather 
delay 
the 
implementation. There is no doubt that Performance Bank 
Guarantee can be invoked by the MC Lenders, but the said 
invocation can only take place when SRA has failed to 
implement the Plan. Present is a case where directions have 
been issued to both MC Lenders and SRA to implement the 
Plan and the event of failure of the Plan has not yet arrived. 
When the Adjudicating Authority has directed on 13.01.2023 
to take steps towards the implementation of the Plan and 
which order was not been stayed by this Tribunal on 
03.03.2023, the steps ought to have been taken by the MC 
Lenders in furtherance of the implementation. The time has 
not arrived for invoking the Performance Bank Guarantee. 
When the SRA is ready to undertake to perform its 
obligations under the Plan, we are of the view that 
Performance Bank Guarantee given by the SRA cannot be 
permitted to the invoked by the MC Lenders. MC Lenders 
instead of threatening to invoke Performance Bank 
Guarantee, 
should 
take 
steps, 
which 
may 
help 
implementation of the Plan and to achieve the objective of 
Resolution Plan. The Resolution Plan has been approved 
with the intent and purpose to revive the Corporate Debtor, 
which revival is in accordance with objective and purpose of 
the IBC. We again reiterate that efforts by MC Lenders and 
SRA should be coordinated for revival of the Corporate 
Debtor, so as to start its operations at an early date, which 
is in the interest of all stake holders as well as in the interest 
of Corporate Debtor. 
 
20. In view of the aforesaid, we direct that MC Lenders shall 
not invoke the Performance Bank Guarantee in the facts of 
the present case as on date, and for invocation, if any, MC 
Lenders may take leave of the Adjudicating Authority. The 
IA Nos.2159-2160 is disposed of accordingly.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
 
107. A careful reading of the aforesaid order of the NCLAT reflects that the 
NCLAT had itself conceded to the position that the Appellants have a right to 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 102 of 168 
 
 
invoke the PBG in a situation where the SRA had failed to implement the 
Resolution Plan. This is again in line with the intention under Regulation 
36B(4A). Therefore, even in light of the NCLAT’s own order dated 
26.05.2023, it does not follow that the PBG could have been adjusted by the 
SRA, mid-implementation, against its payment obligation.   
 
108. The NCLAT in its order dated 28.08.2023 dealt with the issue of 
adjustment of PBG against the first tranche payment in light of the offer made 
in the Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 and made certain observations 
regarding Regulation 36B(4A) of the 2016 Regulations. The same are as 
follows: 
 
“26. When we look to the Regulation 36B (4A) it is clear that 
the provision provides that RFRP shall require Resolution 
Applicant to provide Performance Bank Guarantee within 
the time specified. Sub-Section 4A provides that if Resolution 
Applicant after approval fails to implement Performance 
Security it shall stand forfeited. Present is a case, where 
Performance Security has already been provided in 
compliance of sub- Regulation 4A and present is not a case 
that any power to forfeit the Performance Bank Guarantee 
to be exercised under sub-Regulation (4A). On Explanation 
I, attention of the Court was drawn by Learned Counsel for 
SRA, which indicates that the performance security which is 
contemplated, can be of such nature, value, duration and 
source as may be specified. Thus, Performance Security can 
be of a particular duration and when the Resolution Plan 
provides release of security at the time of first tranche of 
payment of Rs. 350 Crores, no exception can be taken to 
adjustment of the Performance Bank Guarantee. The request 
of SRA to adjust Performance Bank Guarantee of Rs. 150 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 103 of 168 
 
 
Crores is thus according to Clause 6.4.4 of the Resolution 
Plan on which no exception can be taken. 
 
27. Submission was made by Learned Sr. Counsel for the 
Appellant that performance Bank Guarantee has to be 
maintained till the completion of the plan. The summary of 
payment and security package as contained in the table 
indicate that there are large numbers of other securities 
which are to be continued. The securities in the last column 
which are mortgaged over three Dubai Properties are to be 
released on year 5 or on complete payment whichever is 
earlier. The plan thus provides for adequate securities to 
ensure the payment hence the adjustment of Performance 
Bank Guarantee in the first tranche of payment cannot be 
said to be against the Resolution Plan. We thus are of the 
view that prayer made by the Applicant in the Application in 
Prayer (a) is to be allowed.” 
(emphasis supplied)  
 
109. A bare perusal of the above observations would indicate that the NCLAT 
proceeded on an incorrect understanding of Regulation 36B(4A) and its First 
Explanation. Regulation 36B(4A) does not state that if the Resolution 
Applicant, after approval, fails to implement the PBG, then it shall stand 
forfeited. Instead, what the Regulation actually states is that the performance 
security shall stand forfeited, if the resolution applicant of such a plan, after 
its approval by the Adjudicating Authority, “fails to implement or contributes 
to the failure of implementation of that plan in accordance with the terms of 
the plan and its implementation schedule”. It is not the failure to implement 
the performance security i.e., the PBG, that is dealt with in this Regulation but 
the consequence of the failure to implement “the Plan” by the SRA.  

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 104 of 168 
 
 
 
110. Further the order dated 28.08.2023 proceeds to interpret Explanation I to 
Regulation 36B(4A) and states that since according to Explanation I, the 
performance security can be of a particular duration, the Resolution Plan can 
provide for the release of security at the time of the first tranche payment of 
Rs. 350 Crore and no exception can be taken to the adjustment of the PBG. 
However, what the NCLAT failed to take notice of is that under Explanation 
I to Regulation 36B(4A), the performance security shall mean security of such 
nature, value, duration and source, as may be specified “in the request for 
resolution plans”. The duration of the performance security that has been 
specified in the RFRP is given under Clauses 3.13.2 and 3.13.8 of the RFRP 
which categorically states that the PBG shall be kept alive until the Resolution 
Plan has been completely implemented. This is the duration which is referred 
to in Explanation I to Regulation 36B(4A).  
 
111. Now, if the intention under the RFRP, the Resolution Plan (under Clauses 
7.3 and 9.4) and Regulation 36B(4A) was that the PBG had to be kept alive 
till the completion of implementation of the Resolution Plan by the SRA and 
that it cannot be set-off against any payment obligation, then how do we 
reconcile such an intention with the expression “PBG adjusted” mentioned 
under Clause 6.4.4 of the Resolution Plan? As mentioned above, Clauses 7.3 
and 9.4 respectively of the Resolution Plan incorporated the terms of the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 105 of 168 
 
 
RFRP into the Resolution Plan. Clause 3.13.9 of the RFRP states that the PBG 
shall not be set off against any payment or consideration which is to be made 
by the SRA, even if expressly provided so under the Resolution Plan. Clause 
6.4.4 is quite ambiguous in its construction regarding the question whether the 
PBG can be specifically adjusted against the first tranche payment. Although 
in the Summary of Payments and Security Package, under the column titled 
“Date of release of security”, the expression “PBG adjusted” exists, yet Clause 
6.4.4(a)(i) which furnishes some additional clarity on the Summary of 
Payments and Security Package provides no mention of the PBG under the 
heading “Date of release of Security”, while the other two forms of security 
i.e., the BKC property and Dubai property No.1 are mentioned. The argument 
of the counsel for the Respondent is that this omission indicates that the PBG 
would be adjusted under the first tranche payment. However, in our 
considered opinion irrespective of whether Clause 6.4.4 expressly or 
impliedly provided for the PBG to be adjusted, such a provision would create 
a dissonance with Clause 3.13.9 of the RFRP which has also been made 
binding on the SRA through Clauses 7.3 and 9.4 respectively of the Resolution 
Plan. Therefore, such an adjustment should not be allowed in the facts of the 
present case.  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 106 of 168 
 
 
II. 
The Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 did not impose conditions 
which were different from the terms of the Resolution Plan. 
 
112. It is the case of the Appellants that Serial No.11 under Clause 7.7.1 read 
with Clause 6.1.3(g) evidences that the SRA had to infuse Rs. 350 Crore “in 
cash” and it was for this reason alone that Para 8(a) of the Lender’s Affidavit 
required the infusion of Rs. 350 Crore to be done in cash by 31.08.2023. It 
was submitted that such a requirement for cash payment flowed directly from 
the Resolution Plan under which an adjustment of the PBG was impermissible 
and not just out of the Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023. This is because 
the Lender’s Affidavit has not and cannot impose any condition over and 
above the one laid under the Resolution Plan.  
 
113.  On the other hand, the Respondents vehemently submitted that it was only 
the Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 which stipulated the condition that 
Rs. 350 Crore had to be infused in cash by 31.08.2023, while the Resolution 
Plan, under Clause 6.4.4 allowed for the payment of Rs. 200 Crore in cash and 
Rs. 150 Crore through adjusting the PBG. In other words, they argued that the 
conditions envisaged in the Lender’s Affidavit were different from those 
stipulated in the Resolution Plan. 
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 107 of 168 
 
 
114. However, the intent of the legislature is very clear on the aspect that once 
a Resolution Plan is approved by the Adjudicating Authority i.e., the NCLT, 
it becomes binding on all the stakeholders involved in the Resolution Plan. 
Section 31(1) of the IBC, 2016 reads as thus:  
 
“31. (1) If the Adjudicating Authority is satisfied that the 
resolution plan as approved by the committee of creditors 
under sub-section (4) of section 30 meets the requirements 
as referred to in sub-section (2) of section 30, it shall by 
order approve the resolution plan which shall be binding on 
the corporate debtor and its employees, members, 
creditors,[including the Central Government, any State 
Government or any local authority to whom a debt in respect 
of the payment of dues arising under any law for the time 
being in force, such as authorities to whom statutory dues 
are owed,] guarantors and other stakeholders involved in 
the resolution plan.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
 
115. This Court in Ebix Singapore Private Limited v. Committee Of Creditors 
of Educomp Solutions Limited and Another reported in (2022) 2 SCC 401 
was faced with the issue whether withdrawals or modifications by successful 
resolution applicants were permissible under the IBC, 2016 i.e., whether a 
resolution applicant is entitled to withdraw or modify its Resolution Plan, once 
it has been submitted by the Resolution Professional to the Adjudicating 
Authority and before it is approved by such authority under Section 31(1) of 
the IBC, 2016. It was unequivocally held that, based on the plain terms of the 
IBC, 2016, the Adjudicating Authority lacks the power to allow the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 108 of 168 
 
 
withdrawal or modification of the Resolution Plan by a successful resolution 
applicant or to give effect to any such clauses in the Resolution Plan. The 
relevant observations made are reproduced hereinbelow:  
 
“164. The approval of the adjudicating authority under 
Section 31(1) IBC has the effect of making the resolution 
plan binding on all stakeholders. These stakeholders include 
the employees of the corporate debtor whose terms of 
employment would be governed by the resolution plan, the 
Central and State Governments who would receive their tax 
dues on the basis of the terms of the resolution plan and local 
authorities to whom dues are owed. These stakeholders are 
not direct participants in the CIRP but are bound by its 
consequence by virtue of the approval of the resolution plan, 
under Section 31(1) IBC. Section 31(1) ensures that the 
resolution plan becomes binding on all stakeholders after it 
is approved by the adjudicating authority. The language of 
Section 31(1) cannot be construed to mean that a resolution 
plan is indeterminate or open to withdrawal or modification 
until it is approved by the adjudicating authority or that it is 
not binding between the CoC and the successful resolution 
applicant. Regulation 39(4) of the CIRP Regulations 
mandates that the RP should endeavor to submit the plan at 
least fifteen days before the statutory period of the CIRP 
under Section 12 is due to expire along with a receipt of a 
PBG and a compliance certificate as Form H. It is pertinent 
to note that sub-section (3) to Section 12 mandates that the 
CIRP process, including legal proceedings, must be 
concluded within 330 days. This three-hundred-and-thirty-
day period can be extended only in exceptional 
circumstances, if the process is at near conclusion and serves 
the object of IBC, as held by a three-Judge Bench of this 
Court in Essar Steel [Essar Steel (India) Ltd. (CoC) v. Satish 
Kumar Gupta, (2020) 8 SCC 531 : (2021) 2 SCC (Civ) 443]. 
Therefore, after accounting for all statutorily envisaged 
delays which the RP has to explain in its Form H and 
otherwise through Regulation 40-B, the procedure envisages 
a fifteen-day window between submission of resolution plan 
and its approval or rejection by the adjudicating authority. 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 109 of 168 
 
 
This clearly indicates that the statute envisages a certain 
level of finality before the resolution plan is submitted for 
approval to the adjudicating authority. Even the CoC is not 
permitted to approve multiple resolution plans or solicit EoIs 
after submission of a resolution plan to the adjudicating 
authority, which would possibly be in contemplation if the 
resolution applicant was permitted to withdraw from, or 
modify, the plan after acceptance by the CoC. Regulation 36-
B(4-A) requires the furnishing of a performance security 
which will be forfeited if a resolution applicant fails to 
implement the plan. This is collected before the adjudicating 
authority approves the plan. Notably, the Regulations also 
direct forfeiture of the performance security in case the 
resolution applicant “contributes to the failure of 
implementation”, which could potentially include any 
attempts at withdrawal of the plan.

172. Based on the plain terms of the statute, the adjudicating 
authority lacks the authority to allow the withdrawal or 
modification of the resolution plan by a successful resolution 
applicant or to give effect to any such clauses in the 
resolution plan. Unlike Section 18(3)(b) of the erstwhile 
SICA which vested the Board for Industrial and Financial 
Reconstruction with the power to make modifications to a 
draft scheme for sick industrial companies, the adjudicating 
authority under Section 31(2) IBC can only examine the 
validity of the plan on the anvil of the grounds stipulated in 
Section 30(2) and either approve or reject the plan. The 
adjudicating authority cannot compel a CoC to negotiate 
further with a successful resolution applicant. A rejection by 
the adjudicating authority is followed by a direction of 
mandatory liquidation under Section 33. Section 30(2) does 
not envisage setting aside of the resolution plan because the 
resolution applicant is unwilling to execute it, based on terms 
of its own resolution plan.

222. If the legislature in its wisdom, were to recognise the 
concept of withdrawals or modifications to a resolution plan 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 110 of 168 
 
 
after it has been submitted to the adjudicating authority, it 
must specifically provide for a tether under IBC and/or the 
Regulations. This tether must be coupled with directions on 
narrowly defined grounds on which such actions are 
permissible and procedural directions, which may include 
the timelines in which they can be proposed, voting 
requirements and threshold for approval by the CoC (as the 
case may be). They must also contemplate at which stage the 
corporate debtor may be sent into liquidation by the 
adjudicating authority or otherwise, in the event of a failed 
negotiation for modification and/or withdrawal. These are 
matters for legislative policy. 
 
223. In the present framework, even if an impermissible 
understanding of equity is imported through the route of 
residual powers or the terms of the resolution plan are 
interpreted in a manner that enables the appellants' desired 
course of action, it is wholly unclear on whether a 
withdrawal of a CoC-approved resolution plan at a later 
stage of the process would result in the adjudicating 
authority directing mandatory liquidation of the corporate 
debtor. Pertinently, this direction has been otherwise 
provided in Section 33(1)(b) IBC when an adjudicating 
authority rejects a resolution plan under Section 31. In this 
context, we hold that the existing insolvency framework in 
India provides no scope for effecting further modifications 
or withdrawals of CoC-approved resolution plans, at the 
behest of the successful resolution applicant, once the plan 
has been submitted to the adjudicating authority. A 
resolution 
applicant, 
after 
obtaining 
the 
financial 
information 
of 
the 
corporate 
debtor 
through 
the 
informational utilities and perusing the IM, is assumed to 
have analysed the risks in the business of the corporate 
debtor and submitted a considered proposal. A submitted 
resolution plan is binding and irrevocable as between the 
CoC and the successful resolution applicant in terms of the 
provisions of IBC and the CIRP Regulations. In the case of 
Kundan Care, since both, the resolution applicant and the 
CoC, have requested for modification of the resolution plan 
because of the uncertainty over the PPA, cleared by the 
ruling of this Court in Gujarat Urja [Gujarat Urja Vikas 
Nigam Ltd. v. Amit Gupta, (2021) 7 SCC 209 : (2021) 4 SCC 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 111 of 168 
 
 
(Civ) 1] , a one-time relief under Article 142 of the 
Constitution is provided with the conditions prescribed in 
Section K.2.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
 
116.  In light of the aforesaid, it is clear that the existing insolvency framework 
does not provide any scope for effecting further modifications or withdrawals 
of the Resolution Plan approved by the CoC, at the behest of the successful 
resolution applicant, once the plan has been submitted to the adjudicating 
authority. The submitted Resolution Plan is binding and irrevocable as 
between the CoC and the successful resolution applicant in terms of the 
provisions of the IBC, 2016 and the 2016 Regulations as well. In other words, 
once a CoC-approved resolution plan is submitted to the Adjudicating 
Authority i.e., NCLT, it immediately becomes binding on the CoC and the 
SRA, even if the Adjudicating Authority has not yet given its stamp of 
approval on the same. While deciding so, this Court re-emphasized the object 
under Section 31(1) of the IBC, 2016 and observed that once the Adjudicating 
Authority has approved the plan under Section 31(1) of the IBC, 2016, the 
Resolution Plan is binding on all the stakeholders including those stakeholders 
who are not direct participants of the CIRP. Therefore, there is absolutely no 
scope for modification of the terms of a Resolution Plan which has received 
the imprimatur of the Adjudicating Authority, be it by the Adjudicating 
Authority itself, the CoC or the SRA.  

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 112 of 168 
 
 
 
117. When the aforesaid is the position of law, and the NCLT had approved the 
present Resolution Plan vide order dated 22.06.2021, the Resolution Plan was 
immune to any modification or alteration whatsoever. Therefore, the 
Appellants could have only proposed an offer under the Lender’s Affidavit 
dated 16.08.2023 which stood true to the terms of the Resolution Plan 
approved by the NCLT. They could not have created any deviations, 
alterations or modifications of the terms of the Resolution Plan. It is in this 
context that the submission of the SRA that, the Lender’s Affidavit required 
an infusion of Rs. 350 Crore in cash, while the Resolution Plan allowed for 
the payment of Rs. 200 Crore in cash and Rs. 150 Crore through adjustment 
of the PBG, must be rejected. Both the Resolution Plan and the Lender’s 
Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 reflected the same terms i.e., infusion “in cash” of 
the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore. In fact, even the date within which 
the Lender’s Affidavit required Rs. 350 Crore to be infused in cash i.e., 
31.08.2023 was in compliance with the order dated 26.05.2023 passed by the 
NCLAT granting the 2nd Implementation Extension. Therefore, no new terms 
were cast on the SRA.  
 
118. The fact that the Lender’s Affidavit did not impose any condition which 
was different from that contemplated under the Resolution Plan, was also 
understood by all the parties involved, including the SRA. This is evident from 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 113 of 168 
 
 
the arguments put forth by the SRA, before the NCLAT and before this Court 
respectively, which dealt with the issue of whether the adjustment of the PBG 
was possible under the terms of the Lender’s Affidavit. The following were 
the submissions made by the SRA in the order dated 28.08.2023 as recorded 
by the NCLAT:  
“20. Learned Sr. Counsel for the SRA has submitted that 
approved 
Resolution 
Plan 
provides 
adjustment 
of 
Performance Bank Guarantee towards first tranche of 
payment whereas Learned Counsel for the Appellants has 
referred to certain clauses of RFRP and also provisions of 
Regulation 36B (4A) to support his submission that 
performance bank guarantee cannot be permitted to be 
invoked towards payment of first tranche.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
 
119. The submissions made by the SRA as recorded in the order of this Court 
dated 18.01.2024 are as follows:  
“18. The submission which has been urged on behalf of the 
lenders has been opposed on behalf of the SRA by Mr. 
Krishnendu Datta, senior counsel, on behalf of the SRA, it 
has been submitted that:  
(i) 
The Resolution Plan specifically contemplates the 
adjustment of the PBG (originally of Rs. 47.5 crores, 
subsequently enhanced to Rs. 150 crores). In support 
of this submission, reliance has been placed on the 
summary of payments and security package forming a 
part of clause 6.4.4 of the Resolution Plan;  
(ii) 
The SRA was in the first tranche required to pay an 
amount of up to Rs. 185 crores against the creation of 
securities, namely, (i) PBG of Rs. 47.5 crores; (ii) 
BKC Property (if given); and (iii) Mortgage over 
Dubai Property No 1 valued at over Rs. 100 crores. In 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 114 of 168 
 
 
the last column of the table, it has been stipulated that 
the securities would be released, as indicated;  
(iii) The PBG was liable to be adjusted against the cash 
payment of the first tranche of Rs. 185 crores;  
(iv) 
No specific date for the release of the security in 
relation to the PBG has been mentioned;  
(v) 
Moreover, in respect of the second tranche comprising 
of Rs. 195 crores, there was no requirement to furnish 
any security in the form of a PBG;  
(vi) 
The securities, in other words, were of a revolving 
nature, but significantly on the release of the PBG 
against a cash payment of Rs. 185 crores, the PBG is 
not required to be renewed as a fresh security for the 
following tranches; and …” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
120. A perusal of the abovementioned would indicate that both the parties as 
well as the NCLAT were ad idem on the fact that the terms imposed by the 
Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 were in pursuance of and similar to the 
terms of the Resolution Plan. This is because, in order to take benefit of the 
offer made in the Lender’s Affidavit, the SRA had repeatedly asserted that the 
PBG should be allowed to be adjusted under the terms of the Resolution Plan 
and as a consequence, such an adjustment must be allowed under the Lender’s 
Affidavit as well. Even the NCLAT in its order dated 28.08.2023 had held that 
the SRA could adjust the PBG of Rs. 150 Crore to take benefit of the offer of 
the Lender’s Affidavit by relying on Clause 6.4.4 of the Resolution Plan which 
provided for the summary of payments and security package.   
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 115 of 168 
 
 
121. Therefore, in our view the conditions imposed on the SRA under the 
Lender’s Affidavit and the Resolution Plan were one and the same, the only 
difference being that the Appellants had offered not to press issues relating to 
the 
compliance 
of 
the 
Conditions 
Precedent 
and 
grant 
of 
extensions/exclusions along with offering to withdraw the Company Appeal 
and the Appeals pending before this Court.  
 
122. The order of this Court dated 18.01.2024 must be seen & understood in the 
aforesaid background. While the appeal before us had resulted from several 
interim orders of the NCLAT, the question before us was whether the 
adjustment of the PBG of Rs. 150 Crore was permissible under the Lender’s 
Affidavit as well as the terms of the Resolution Plan, being one and the same. 
We interpreted the term “infuse” as mentioned in the affidavit and under the 
Resolution Plan, and arrived at the conclusion that it demonstrably meant 
“payment in cash”. Therefore, the directions that were issued by this Court, 
especially the direction that - “the SRA shall peremptorily on or before 31 
January 2024, deposit an amount of Rs. 150 crores into the designated 
account of SBI, failing which the consequences under the Resolution Plan 
shall follow”, must have been necessarily seen in the context of the Resolution 
Plan as well. The phrase “failing which the consequences under the Resolution 
Plan shall follow” was a mandatory direction that should have been taken into 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 116 of 168 
 
 
account by the NCLAT in its impugned order dated 12.03.2024. There was no 
escape for the NCLAT in this regard. There was no option which was given 
to the SRA to deviate from this direction which purely stemmed from the 
Resolution Plan. The fact that this direction was binding was clearly 
understood by the SRA since it attempted to file another Miscellaneous 
Application before this Court requesting for an extension to comply with our 
order dated 18.01.2024 which was dismissed as misconceived.  
 
123. There were two other directions which were issued by us in our order dated 
18.01.2024 i.e., (ii) that the PBG of Rs. 150 Crore shall continue to remain in 
operation and effect pending the final disposal of the appeal before the 
NCLAT, and shall abide by the final outcome of the appeal and the directions 
that may be issued by the NCLAT; and (iii) whether or not the SRA has been 
compliant with all the conditions of the Resolution Plan as well as of the 
conditions set out in paragraph 8 of the affidavit dated 16 August 2023 shall 
be decided by the NCLAT in the pending appeal. These two directions must 
not be seen as giving any leeway to the NCLAT to act in complete ignorance 
or defiance of the first direction that was issued by us. Such a selective 
compliance with our order dated 18.01.2024 deserves to be nipped in the bud 
more particularly when it was mandated that our directions be considered and 
complied with in its entirety. Therefore, the NCLAT, while finally deciding 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 117 of 168 
 
 
the pending Company Appeal on merits which led to the impugned order dated 
12.03.2024 has, either by design or unknowingly, ignored the directions issued 
by this Court vide order dated 18.01.2024 that the remaining amount of Rs. 
150 Crore had to be necessarily deposited in cash only. This has resulted in a 
perverse decision which stands contrary to law and to the terms of the 
Resolution Plan itself.  
 
124. In view of our crystal clear order dated 18.01.2024, we are of the opinion 
that the PBG of Rs. 150 Crore could not have been allowed to be adjusted with 
the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore. Non-compliance of the SRA with 
the order of this Court has led to a dereliction of its obligations to implement 
the Resolution Plan.  
 
ii. 
Whether the non-implementation of the Resolution Plan by the SRA 
necessarily leads to the consequence of liquidation as under Section 
33(3) of the IBC, 2016? 
 
125. In the foregoing paragraphs, we have reached the conclusion that the SRA 
failed to implement the Resolution Plan by not infusing the first tranche 
payment of Rs. 350 Crore in cash, as required by Clause 6.3.1(g) and the 
Implementation Schedule under Clause 7.7 of the Resolution Plan. It is now 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 118 of 168 
 
 
to be seen if this has resulted in the contravention of other terms of the 
Resolution Plan as well.  
 
a. Whether Respondent No.1/SRA had failed to implement the Resolution 
Plan on non-payment of the Airport Dues as per the terms of the 
Resolution Plan?  
 
126. With respect to the Airport dues, the impugned order of the NCLAT had 
taken into consideration Clauses 6.4.1(e), 6.4.1(h) and 6.4.1(m) respectively. 
Specifically dealing with Clause 6.4.1(h), it said that this provision dealt with 
the treatment of outstanding CIRP costs which included parking charge i.e., 
Airport Charges. While considering so, the following observations were 
made:  
“54. The provisions of Resolution Plan as noted above 
clearly indicates that CIRP costs includes Airport Charges. 
SRA is also entitled to use funds available with the Corporate 
Debtor as on effective date to meet any portion of CIRP 
costs. The submission of the Appellants that the entire 
Airport Charges have to be borne by the SRA upfront cannot 
be accepted nor non-payment of Airport Charges by SRA as 
on date makes the allotment of slot unavailable to the SRA. 
Allotment of slot having been achieved by the SRA as noted 
above, non-payment of airport charges upfront by SRA 
cannot be said to be a reason to not accept the fulfillment of 
condition of slot allotment. The payment of Airport Charges 
has to be made as per the Resolution Plan when the 
implementation of the plans commences as per the 
Resolution Plan. We thus do not find any substance in the 
submission of Learned Counsel for the Appellant that 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 119 of 168 
 
 
allotment of slot is not completed since airport charges have 
not been paid by the SRA. 
 
55. With regard to submission of the Appellant that old dues 
of Airport Charges having not been settled, the Adjudicating 
Authority has rightly observed that settling old dues cannot 
be conceded as non-allotment of slots. We thus fully concur 
with the finding of the Adjudicating Authority that conditions 
precedent under Clause 7.6.1(c) were fulfilled.” 
(emphasis supplied).    
 
 
127. The case of the Appellants is that upon consideration of Clause 6.4.1(h), 
the NCLAT erroneously concluded that the Airport Charges would be a part 
of the CIRP costs. Clause 6.4.1(h) of the Resolution Plan is reproduced 
hereinbelow:  
“(h) Based on the information provided, the Resolution 
Applicant have assumed that the amounts standing to the 
credit of the bank account of the Corporate Debtor 
(including amounts estimated to be received subsequently) 
are sufficient to cover for the CIRP Costs of the Corporate 
Debtor (excluding parking charges, rental charges, 
employee dues, taxes etc). Accordingly, the Resolution 
Applicant has set aside a sum of Rs. 25 Crores as CIRP Costs 
towards payment of any such costs until the Approval Date. 
Any expenses incurred by the Corporate Debtor from the 
Approval Date until the Effective Date will be incurred out 
of the positive bank balance of the Corporate Debtor.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
128. A plain reading of Clause 6.4.1(h) reveals that the amount standing to the 
credit of the bank account of the Corporate Debtor would be sufficient to cover 
the CIRP costs of the Corporate Debtor but that this would exclude the parking 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 120 of 168 
 
 
charges, rental charges, employee dues, taxes etc. Therefore, the clause does 
not expressly exclude Airport Charges from the ambit of CIRP costs entirely 
but only states that the amount available in the bank account of the Corporate 
Debtor would be insufficient to cover the parking charges, rental charges etc 
which also form a part of the CIRP costs. Since such a bank balance would 
not cover the parking charge, rental charges, employee dues, taxes etc, the 
Resolution Plan had set apart a separate sum of Rs. 25 Crore for the payment 
of any such CIRP costs which might have accrued till the Approval Date. 
Further, the other expenses including parking charges, rental charges etc. 
which have been incurred post the Approval Date but within the Effective 
Date i.e., the period during which the Conditions Precedent would be fulfilled, 
would also be incurred out of the positive bank balance of the Corporate 
Debtor. This is what Clause 6.4.1(h) provides for. To hold that Clause 6.4.1(h) 
excludes airport dues from the scope of CIRP costs altogether would also 
question the placement of clauses such as Clauses 6.4.1(f) (which provides for 
an estimate of Rs. 240 Crore towards parking charges) under the larger 
umbrella of Clause 6.4.1 which deals with the “Treatment of Outstanding 
CIRP Costs” in totality. 
129. Therefore, what the Resolution Plan contemplates is that the Airport 
Charges be subsumed within the CIRP Dues and since all of the different 
CIRP dues cannot be satisfied through the bank balance which stands to the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 121 of 168 
 
 
credit of the Corporate Debtor, a separate sum of Rs. 25 Crore was demarcated 
towards the remaining CIRP payments. Hence, the NCLAT was right in 
arriving at the conclusion that Airport Dues were indeed a part of the CIRP 
costs.  
 
130. It must further be noted that, the impugned order of the NCLAT nowhere 
caps the Airport Dues to a maximum of Rs. 25 Crore. Moreover, such a 
mention of Rs. 25 Crore is plainly absent in its observations regarding Airport 
Dues. All that is mentioned is that “The payment of Airport Charges has to be 
made as per the Resolution Plan when the implementation of the plan 
commences as per the Resolution Plan”. It is in this regard that Clause 6.4.1(j) 
provides that if the CIRP costs exceed the current estimates, then they will be 
paid as per “actuals” in compliance with the provisions of the IBC and as a 
consequence, the pay-outs towards the other creditors would be reduced 
proportionately to account for such additional CIRP costs. This would be 
subject to a minimum payment of liquidation value to the Operational 
Creditors and Dissenting Financial Creditors of the Corporate Debtor and 
subject to a maximum of Rs. 475 Crore. Therefore, the Resolution Plan, too, 
does not contemplate the CIRP costs to be strictly subject to a maximum of 
Rs. 25 Crore. To accept such a contention of the Appellants would be to 
misinterpret the observations made in the impugned order. 
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 122 of 168 
 
 
131. The Appellants rely on Clause 6.3.1(d), specifically under the heading 
“BKC Property not part of Resolution” to assert that the Airport Dues have to 
be settled upfront and in full in the first 180 days from the Effective Date and 
that it cannot be in staggered payments spread across a period of time. 
However, Clause 6.3.1(d) which is titled “Proposal for Resolution of 
Outstanding Airport and Parking Dues (Rs. 240 Crores as of August 31, 2020” 
is attached with the following qualification:  
“The Resolution Applicant states and confirms that this 
“Proposal for Resolution of outstanding airport and parking 
dues (approx. Rs. 240 Crores as of August 31,2020)” which 
deals with the appropriation of the BKC Property is merely 
a proposal and not a condition to the implementation of this 
Resolution Plan and the CoC has the discretion to 
accept/reject such a proposal. If the above-mentioned 
proposal is acceptable to the CoC, then it is acceptable to 
the Resolution Applicant in the manner stated hereinabove”. 
(emphasis supplied)  
 
The contention of the SRA is that the aforesaid qualification applies equally 
to the part of Clause 6.3.1(d) under the heading “BKC Property not part of 
resolution” and that the entire Clause 6.3.1(d) would remain a proposal and 
not a binding condition on the SRA. Irrespective of a determination on the 
same, even as per Clause 6.4.1, the payment towards CIRP costs including 
Airport Charges had to be made in full, in priority, within 180 days from the 
Effective Date. This is evident from – (a) Clause 6.4.1(a) which states that the 
CIRP Costs are to be paid in priority to any other creditor of the Corporate 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 123 of 168 
 
 
Debtor in terms of Section 30(2)(a) of the IBC, 2016; (b) Clause 6.4.1(k) 
which states that the outstanding CIRP costs shall be paid by the Resolution 
Applicant out of the funds infused by the Resolution Applicant in the 
Corporate Debtor and as per the Implementation Schedule set out in Clause 
7.7 below; (c) Clause 6.4.1(m) which states that the CIRP cost shall be “fully 
paid and discharged after the Effective Date” before payment is made to any 
of the creditors as per the Resolution Plan; (d) Clause 6.4.1(n) which states 
that the Resolution Applicant has sufficient funds and that the CIRP costs shall 
be met out of funds infused by the Resolution Applicant; and (e) S.No. 16 of 
the Implementation Schedule under Clause 7.7 which states that the CIRP 
costs must be paid as per Clause 6.4.1 within Z+170 days.  
132. Therefore, the SRA not having infused the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 
Crore as per Clause 6.3.1(g) and S. No. 11 of the Implementation Schedule 
under Clause 7.7 within a period of 180 days from the Effective Date and 
within the multiple extensions granted therefrom, has defaulted on its 
obligation towards the payment of CIRP costs (which include airport dues) 
under Clause 6.4.1 as well.  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 124 of 168 
 
 
b. Whether Respondent No.1/SRA could be said to have failed to implement 
the Resolution Plan on account of the non-payment of workmen and 
employees’ dues as per the terms of the Resolution Plan and the order of 
the NCLT dated 21.10.2022 which was confirmed by the order dated 
31.01.2023 of this Court?   
 
133. The Resolution Plan, under Clause 6.4.2 deals with the “Treatment of 
Employees/Workmen dues, including dues of the Authorized Representatives 
of Employees/Workmen”. Clause 6.4.2(a) provides for a fixed sum of Rs. 52 
Crore to be paid to the workmen and employees towards settlement of all their 
claims. Clause 6.4.2(b) states that this payment shall be made out of the funds 
infused by the SRA in the Corporate Debtor, in priority to the payment to the 
financial creditors and as per the Implementation Schedule set out in Clause 
7.7 i.e., within 175 days from the Effective Date. Clause 6.4.2(c) provides that 
if the Liquidation Value due to the workmen and employees is not “nil”, then 
the SRA would pay such a Liquidation Value. If this Liquidation Value is over 
and above the amount proposed to be paid under the Resolution Plan, then 
such additional amounts shall be first paid out of the positive bank balance of 
the Corporate Debtor as on the Effective Date and the remaining amounts shall 
be paid out of the amounts reserved for other creditors on a pro rata basis, 
subject to a maximum of Rs. 475 Crore.  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 125 of 168 
 
 
134. The order dated 21.10.2022 of the NCLAT dealt with the entitlements of 
the workmen and employees to several payments and made the following 
observations:  
 
“71. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we arrive at 
following conclusions: 
(i) The workmen and employees are entitled for payment of 
full amount of provident fund and gratuity till the date of 
commencement of the insolvency which amount is to be paid 
by the Successful Resolution Applicant consequent to 
approval of the Resolution Plan in addition to the 24 months 
workmen dues as the workmen is entitled to under Section 
53(1)(b) of the Code. It is made clear that in addition to part 
amount of provident fund and gratuity as proposed in 
Resolution Plan to workmen, Successful Resolution 
Applicant is obliged to make payment of balance unpaid 
amount of provident fund and gratuity to workmen and 
employees. 
 
72. Our answer to Question II and III is as follows: 
(i) The workmen and employees are entitled to receive the 
amount of provident fund and gratuity in full since they 
are not part of the liquidation estate under Section 
36(4)(b)(iii). 
(ii) The workmen are entitled to receive their dues from 
the Corporate Debtor for period of 24 months as per 
provision of Section 53(1)(b) at least to minimum 
liquidation value envisaged under Section 32(2)(b) read 
with Section 53(1).

 xxx  
 
 
 xxx  
80. As observed above, in admitted claim of workmen 
provident fund, gratuity and leave encashment was included, 
and payment proposed in plan partly satisfy above dues also. 
The workmen are entitled to full payment of provident fund 
and gratuity, hence, the balance of above dues are to be paid 
by the Successful Resolution Applicant, to satisfy statutory 
obligations. Non-payment of full provident fund and gratuity 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 126 of 168 
 
 
shall lead to violation of Section 30(2)(e), hence, to save the 
plan the above payments have to be made. 
xxx 
 
 
 
 xxx  
 
 
 xxx  
128. In the forgoing discussions, we have noted that the 
liquidation value of the workmen as has been referred to in 
Form-H preferred by the Resolution Professional is Rs.113 
crores and workmen were entitled to receive at least Rs.113 
crores as per Section 30(2)(b) read with Section 53(1)(b) of 
the Code. Shri Krishnendu Datta, learned Counsel for 
Successful Resolution Applicant during his submission, 
submitted that Successful Resolution Applicant shall be 
paying an amount of Rs.113 crores to the workmen as per 
the Resolution Plan, since it was contemplated that, if 
liquidation value is more than Rs.52 crores, the liquidation 
value shall be payable to the workmen. To clear any doubt, 
we deem it fit and proper to issue direction to Successful 
Resolution Applicant to make payment to the workmen of 
Rs.113 crores as per the Resolution Plan.

134. In result, the Appeal(s) are decided in following 
manner: 
(I) The Appeal(s) of workmen and employees being Company 
Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) Nos. 643 of 2021, 752 of 2021, 801 
of 2021, 915 of 2021, 771 of 2022 are partly allowed with 
following directions: 
(a) Successful Resolution Applicant is directed to make 
payment of unpaid provident fund to the workmen till date of 
insolvency commencement, after deducting the amount 
already paid towards provident fund in the Resolution Plan 
to the workmen. 
(b) The workmen are also entitled for payment of their 
gratuity dues as on insolvency commencement date, after 
adjusting any amount towards gratuity paid under the 
Resolution Plan. 
It is made clear that entitlement of those employees and 
workmen, who were demerged into AGSL shall not be there, 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 127 of 168 
 
 
since demerger has not been treated as termination of their 
services. 
(c) The employees are also entitled for the payment of their 
full provident fund, unpaid up to the date of insolvency 
commencement date. It is made clear that full payment of 
provident fund would be of that unpaid part of provident 
fund, which has not been deposited by the Corporate Debtor 
in the EPFO. 
(d) Employees shall also be entitled for the gratuity, which 
fell due up to insolvency commencement date. 
(e) The rest of the prayers of the workmen and employees are 
denied. 
(f) The Chairman of the Monitoring Committee, erstwhile 
Resolution Professional is directed to compute the payments 
to be made to workmen and employees within one month 
from today and communicate the same to the Successful 
Resolution Applicant to take steps for payment.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
135. Thus, it was held in clear terms that the workmen and employees are 
entitled to full payment of Provident Fund and Gratuity. The non-payment of 
these amounts shall lead to a violation of Section 30(2)(e) of the IBC, 2016 
which requires that the Resolution Plan must not contravene any of the 
provisions of the law for the time being in force. Further, it was held that the 
workmen and employees are entitled to a liquidation value of Rs. 113 Crore 
instead of Rs. 52 Crore as contemplated in the Resolution Plan. The NCLAT 
directed the Chairman of the Monitoring Committee (the erstwhile Resolution 
Professional) to compute the payments to be made to the workmen and 
employees within one month and to communicate the same to the SRA. The 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 128 of 168 
 
 
RP had arrived at a figure of Rs. 226.6 Crore which comprised of Rs. 14 Crore 
towards Provident Fund dues, Rs. 188.2 Crore towards Gratuity dues and Rs. 
24.4 Crore towards damages for non-payment of Provident Fund.  
 
136. The SRA sought a clarification of the aforesaid order before the NCLAT 
and vide order dated 02.12.2022, it was made clear that the cost of paying the 
unpaid amount towards the Provident Fund and Gratuity to the workmen and 
employees has to be borne by the SRA. The same cannot be paid out of the 
amounts reserved for the other creditors of the Corporate Debtor on a pro-rata 
basis subject to a maximum of Rs. 475 Crore as stated in Clause 6.4.2(e) of 
the Resolution Plan since that was a contemplation pertaining to the 
liquidation value only and not for the dues relating to Provident Fund and 
Gratuity. An appeal against the order dated 21.10.2022 was dismissed by this 
Court vide order dated 30.01.2023. Therefore, there was no scope left for the 
SRA to avoid payment of the Provident Fund and Gratuity dues to the 
workmen and employees. Such an obligation was in addition to the payment 
of minimum liquidation value that the workmen/employees were entitled to 
under the terms of the Resolution Plan. 
 
137. The SRA had filed IA Nos. 3789-3790 of 2023 in the Company Appeal on 
16.06.2023 praying that the Gratuity Claims be allowed to be paid in three 
tranches i.e., within 3, 4 and 5 years from the Closing Date. The SRA also 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 129 of 168 
 
 
sought leave from the NCLAT to approach the EPFO Authorities under 
Section 14B to seek a reduction or waiver of the damages of Rs. 24.4 crore 
imposed on the Corporate Debtor and to also pursue an appeal against the 
order of the EPFO Authorities directing the SRA to pay the damages. 
Subsequently, on 18.08.2023, the SRA filed two other IAs 3801-3802 of 2023 
in the Company Appeal, praying that, in case the previous IA relating to the 
Gratuity and Provident Fund Claims is not allowed, then the Resolution Plan 
cannot be implemented under Section 30(2)(e) and as a consequence, the 
Lenders be directed to refund all amounts invested or infused into the 
Corporate Debtor by the SRA.  
138. The NCLAT in its impugned order has taken note of its own order dated 
21.10.2022 but has, however, only allowed the upfront payment of the 
Provident Fund dues of Rs. 12 Crore to the workmen and employees along 
with the payments that they are entitled to under the Resolution Plan. There is 
no specific direction as regard the payment obligations related to Gratuity nor 
any decision rendered on the two aforesaid IAs filed by the SRA in the 
Company Appeal. The NCLAT committed a serious error in failing to 
consider these IAs filed by the SRA and has given the impression that the SRA 
is liable to pay only the Provident Fund dues upfront.  
 
139. According to the SRA, the dues relating to the Provident Fund would be 
paid upfront in compliance with Section 11 of the Employees’ Provident Fund 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 130 of 168 
 
 
and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. However, the Gratuity Dues could 
be paid in tranches since neither the order dated 21.10.2022 of the NCLAT 
nor the order dated 30.01.2023 of this Court had imposed any timelines for 
the payment of the Gratuity Dues. Furthermore, it was submitted that the 
provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 were not so stringent. 
However, such a proposal cannot be allowed especially in light of the fact that 
the order dated 21.10.2022 of the NCLAT is unambiguous in its declaration 
that both Provident Fund and Gratuity dues have to be paid by the SRA in 
order to save the Resolution Plan from being hit by Section 30(2)(e) of the 
IBC, 2016.  
 
 
140. Therefore, by not infusing the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore as 
per the Implementation Schedule of the Resolution Plan, the SRA has 
breached the terms of the Resolution Plan which required a minimum 
liquidation value of Rs. 113 Crore to be paid towards the Workmen and 
Employees’ Dues as well. Moreover, both the Provident Fund and Gratuity 
Dues amounting to Rs. 226 Crore should also have been paid by the SRA as 
per the order dated 21.10.2022 of the NCLAT in fulfillment of its obligations, 
which it failed to do.  

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 131 of 168 
 
 
c. Whether there were sufficient grounds before the NCLAT to hold that 
Respondent No.1/SRA had contravened the terms of the approved 
Resolution Plan and that the Corporate Debtor must be directed to be 
liquidated under Section 33(3) of the IBC, 2016?  
 
141. The NCLAT in its impugned order held that the non-deposit of Rs. 150 
Crore in cash towards the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore cannot lead 
to the conclusion that the Resolution Plan had failed. The relevant 
observations are reproduced hereinbelow:  
“79. The submission of the Appellant that on account of non-
deposit INR 150 crores as directed by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court, should lead to liquidation of the Corporate Debtor, 
cannot be accepted. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in its 
judgment dated 18.01.2024 has clearly held that its order 
modifying the direction of the Tribunal is confined only to 
the permission granted to the SRA to adjust INR 150 crores 
PBG. Thus, modification of the order by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court also has to confine to the adjustment of the 
PBG. It was held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court that 
Appellant have asked for infusion of INR 350 crores and 
infusion does not include adjustment of PBG. The Hon’ble 
Supreme Court neither considered nor expressed any 
opinion on the question of liquidation of the Corporate 
Debtor, nor the order dated 18.01.2024 can be read to mean 
that non-compliance of the direction to deposit INR 150 
crores by the SRA by 31.01.2024 should lead to liquidation 
of the Corporate Debtor. The submission of the Appellant 
that non-deposit of INR 150 crores leads to failure of 
Resolution Plan, cannot be accepted. As observed above, 
consequence of non-deposit of INR 150 crores is that these 
Appeals have to be heard on merits and the question, which 
has arisen in the Appeal has to be decided regarding 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 132 of 168 
 
 
compliance of conditions precedent by the SRA by 
20.05.2022.  
 
Further submission of the Appellant that this Tribunal may 
exercise jurisdiction under Section 33, sub-section (3) in 
directing liquidation of the Corporate Debtor due to non-
compliance of deposit on INR 150 crores also cannot be 
accepted. For passing an order under Section 33, sub-
section (3), there has to be adjudication that Resolution Plan 
approved by the Adjudicating Authority has been 
contravened by the Successful Resolution Applicant. We do 
not accept the submission of the Appellant that by non-
deposit of INR 150 crores by 31.01.2024, the SRA has 
contravened the Resolution Plan and order be passed under 
Section 33, sub-section (3).  
 
In view of our above observations and conclusions, we 
answer Question Nos. v, vi, and vii in following manner:  
 
Question No. v: 
Direction of Hon’ble Supreme Court 
permitting the Successful Resolution 
Applicant to infuse INR 150 crores by 
31.01.2024 was in reference to offer 
made by Appellant in affidavit dated 
16.08.2023 
 
Question No. iv: 
The Successful Resolution Applicant 
having not been able to infuse funds by 
31.01.2024 as directed by Hon’ble 
Supreme Court vide its judgment dated 
18.01.2024, it cannot be held that 
Resolution Plan has failed and cannot 
be implemented by the SRA.  
 
Question No. vii: 
No grounds have been made out to 
direct the liquidation of the Corporate 
Debtor under Section 33, sub-section 
(3) in these Appeals.” 
(emphasis supplied)  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 133 of 168 
 
 
142. The NCLAT declined to accept the submission of the Appellant that on 
account of non-deposit of Rs. 150 Crore as directed by this Court, the 
Corporate Debtor should be liquidated. However, this was based on the 
incorrect assumption that the direction of this Court to infuse to Rs. 150 Crore 
in cash was only confined to the terms of the Lenders Affidavit dated 
16.08.2023. Previous segments of the judgment have elaborated in sufficient 
detail that the Lender’s Affidavit could not have provided for conditions 
which were incompatible with the terms of the Resolution Plan. Such an 
affidavit would have been in direct contravention with Section 31(1) of the 
IBC, 2016 which does not permit any modifications to be made in the 
Resolution Plan duly approved by the Adjudicating Authority. Therefore, the 
direction of this Court in its order dated 18.01.2024 was with respect to both 
the Lenders Affidavit and the underlying terms of the Resolution Plan. The 
same was so understood by all the parties involved.  
 
143. The Lender’s Affidavit in precise terms stated that “Failing to comply with 
the conditions mentioned in Para 8(a) to (c) above, the Corporate Debtor 
should be directed to go into liquidation”. It was in this context that this Court 
stated that, “the SRA shall peremptorily on or before 31 January 2024, deposit 
an amount of Rs. 150 crores into the designated account of SBI, failing which 
the consequences under the Resolution Plan will follow”. Therefore, it is 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 134 of 168 
 
 
incorrect to contend that this Court neither considered nor expressed any 
opinion on the question of liquidation of the Corporate Debtor. The 
consequence of non-implementation of the Resolution Plan by the SRA must 
necessarily be liquidation of the Corporate Debtor in accordance with Section 
33(3) of the IBC, 2016. Section 33(3) of the IBC, 2016 reads as thus:  
 
“(3) Where the resolution plan approved by the Adjudicating 
Authority is contravened by the concerned corporate debtor, 
any person other than the corporate debtor, whose interests 
are prejudicially affected by such contravention, may make 
an application to the Adjudicating Authority for a liquidation 
order as referred to in sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of clause 
(b) of sub-section (1).” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 
144. The non-deposit of Rs. 150 Crore had in fact lead to a failure of the 
Resolution Plan on several counts as elaborated herein. In addition to the 
breach of Clauses 6.3.1(g), 6.4.4 and S. No. 11 of the Implementation 
Schedule under Clause 7.7, the non-infusion of the first tranche payment in 
accordance with the terms of the Resolution Plan has also led to an infraction 
as regards Clause 6.4.1 on the payment of CIRP costs and Clause 6.4.2 on the 
payment of workmen/employees’ dues. Further, the payment of the Provident 
Fund and Gratuity dues of the workmen/Employees as mandated by the order 
dated 21.10.2022 of the NCLAT which was confirmed by this Court on 
31.01.2023, has also not been made by the SRA.  

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 135 of 168 
 
 
 
145. The SRA was given multiple extensions, post the Effective Date i.e., 
20.05.2022 in order to implement the Resolution Plan and infuse the first 
tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore into the Corporate Debtor. This includes the 
extensions granted by (a) the NCLT vide order dated 13.01.2023, by which 
the timeline for infusion of the first tranche payment was extended till 
15.05.2023; (b) the NCLAT vide order dated 26.05.2023, where the timeline 
of 180 days was further extended up to 31.08.2023; (c) the NCLAT vide order 
dated 28.08.2023, where the timeline of 180 days was extended up to 
30.09.2023; and (d) this Court vide order dated 18.01.2024, whereby the time 
of 180 days for infusion was extended up to 31.01.2024.  However, 
indisputably, there has been a failure on the part of the SRA to abide by all 
these extended timelines as well. No further extensions or accommodations 
can be given to the SRA in light of the multiple opportunities already granted 
as aforesaid. Further, if such a request for further extension is entertained, it 
would only serve to bring us to the position that the parties were at when the 
order of this Court dated 18.01.2024 was passed.  
 
146. In 
Kridhan 
Infrastructure 
Private 
Limited 
v. 
Venkatesan 
Sankaranarayan and Others reported in (2021) 6 SCC 94 the appellant had 
failed to fulfil its obligations under the Resolution Plan, including that of 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 136 of 168 
 
 
equity infusion, despite numerous opportunities granted over a period of 6 
months. Therefore, the CoC voted by a majority to liquidate the corporate 
debtor as a result of failure to implement the resolution plan. The NCLT had 
allowed the liquidation to proceed and the NCLAT had upheld the same. On 
an appeal before this Court, a statement was made by the successful resolution 
applicant therein that an amount of Rs. 50 Crore would be deposited on or 
before 10.01.2021. Bearing in mind that liquidation under the IBC is a matter 
of last resort, such an opportunity was granted. The time for making the said 
deposit was further extended until 25.02.2021. However, no payment was 
made. By underscoring that time is a crucial facet of the scheme under the 
IBC, this Court held that there was a failure on part of the resolution applicant 
to implement the resolution plan and it was ordered that the liquidation 
proceedings against the corporate debtor be revived. The relevant observations 
are reproduced hereinbelow:  
 
“11. The appellant has been unable to raise the funds. The 
fact of the matter, as it emerges from Mr Viswanathan's 
submissions, is that the appellant will be unable to raise 
funds from the term lenders who are insisting that the status 
of the Company should change from a company under 
liquidation to an active status. The order of liquidation has 
not been set aside. Ultimately, what the request of the 
appellant reduces itself to, is that it would raise funds on a 
mortgage of the assets of the Company and unless the 
Company is brought out of liquidation, it would not be in a 
position to raise the funds. This is unacceptable. At this 
stage, the order of liquidation has only been stayed, but a 
final view was, thus, to be taken by this Court. Sufficient

opportunities were granted to the appellant earlier during 
the pendency of the proceedings both before the NCLT 
and NCLAT. The orders of the NCLT and Nclat make it 
abundantly clear that despite the grant of sufficient time, the 
appellant has not been able to comply with the terms of the 
resolution plan. Since 9-10-2020, despite the passage of 
almost five months, the appellant has not been able to deposit 
an amount of Rs 50 crores. Time is a crucial facet of the 
scheme 
under 
IBC 
[Innoventive 
Industries 
Ltd. v. ICICI Bank, (2018) 1 SCC 407, paras 12-16 : (2018) 
1 SCC (Civ) 356] . To allow such proceedings to lapse into 
an indefinite delay will plainly defeat the object of the 
statute. A good faith effort to resolve a corporate insolvency 
is a preferred course. However, a resolution applicant must 
be fair in its dealings as well. The appellant has failed to 
abide by its obligations. In that view of the matter, we see no 
reason or justification to entertain the civil appeal any 
further. The consequence envisaged under the order of this 
Court shall accordingly ensue in terms of the forfeiture of the 
amount of Rs 20 crores. As a consequence of this order, the 
management shall revert to the liquidator for taking steps in 
accordance with law. The civil appeal is accordingly 
dismissed.” 
(emphasis supplied). 
 
147. The SRA herein has failed to infuse the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 
Crore as envisaged in the Resolution Plan despite the Effective Date being 
fixed on 20.05.2022. As a consequence, the payment of CIRP costs, workmen 
and employees’ dues etc. which must be made in priority over the dues of the 
other creditors have also not been made. More than 5 years have passed and 
the implementation of the Resolution Plan still seems to be a dim light at the 
far end of a long tunnel. Over this period of 5 years, several dues such as the 
Airport dues to be paid by the Corporate Debtor have increased multi-fold due 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 138 of 168 
 
 
to the fault of the SRA and this Court must ensure that such debts stop running 
at some point in time.  
 
148. Although one of the key objectives of the IBC, 2016 is to ensure the 
survival of the corporate debtor as a going concern, yet the same must not 
come at the cost of efficiency. In scenarios such as the present, “timely 
liquidation” is indeed preferred over an “endless resolution process”. Such a 
view will prevent the likelihood of adversely affecting the interests of all the 
creditors who have been suffering due to no fault of their own and also 
securing the maximization of value of the remaining assets.   
 
 
149. At this stage of the implementation of the Resolution Plan, it is no longer 
viable for the SRA to submit that the Resolution Plan shall automatically stand 
withdrawn according to Clause 7.6.4 of the Resolution Plan and upon, such 
withdrawal, the members of the SRA in the MC shall resign, the remaining 
members of the MC shall assume absolute control of the Corporate Debtor 
and all the amounts infused by the SRA would be refunded. This is especially 
so, since the Conditions Precedent were declared to be fulfilled and the 
Effective Date was achieved on 20.05.2022. The consequence of the failure to 
implement the Resolution Plan in terms of Clause 9.4 of the Resolution Plan 
and Clause 3.13.7(iii) of the RFRP is that the Appellants are entitled to invoke 
the PBG automatically without any reference to the SRA. Therefore, it is 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 139 of 168 
 
 
directed that the PBG may be invoked by the Appellants in accordance with 
the terms of the Resolution Plan.  
 
iii. 
Whether the timely implementation of the Resolution Plan is also one 
of the objectives of the IBC, 2016?  
 
150. The Preamble to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 reads as thus:  
“An Act to consolidate and amend the laws relating to 
reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate 
persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound 
manner for maximisation of value of assets of such persons, 
to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit and 
balance the interests of all the stakeholders including 
alteration in the order of priority of payment of Government 
dues and to establish an Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board 
of India, and for matters connected therewith or incidental 
thereto.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
151. The Report of the Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee, 2015 (hereinafter, 
the “2015 Report”) also serves to provide valuable insight into the several 
purposes for which the Code was enacted. Upon highlighting the various 
benefits of a consolidated insolvency regime, the Report also emphasizes on 
the time-bound working of the Code. The relevant observations are 
reproduced hereinbelow:  
“Speed is of essence 
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 140 of 168 
 
 
Speed is of essence for the working of the bankruptcy code, 
for two reasons. First, while the “calm period” can help keep 
an organisation afloat, without the full clarity of ownership 
and control, significant decisions cannot be made. Without 
effective leadership, the firm will tend to atrophy and fail. 
The longer the delay, the more likely it is that liquidation will 
be the only answer. Second, the liquidation value tends to go 
down with time as many assets suffer from a high economic 
rate of depreciation. 
 
From the viewpoint of creditors, a good realisation can 
generally be obtained if the firm is sold as a going concern. 
Hence, when delays induce liquidation, there is value 
destruction. Further, even in liquidation, the realisation is 
lower when there are delays. Hence, delays cause value 
destruction. Thus, achieving a high recovery rate is 
primarily about identifying and combating the sources of 
delay.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
The Report acknowledged that time and speed are of the essence for the 
working of the Code. It conceded that significant decisions cannot be made 
for the company without full clarity as to ownership and control. Therefore, 
the longer it takes for installing effective leadership, the quicker will be the 
rate of atrophy of the company. Over a period of time, this delay in taking 
control of the company will lead to liquidation being the only viable answer. 
In this context, if there is additional delay during the process of liquidation, 
the liquidation value might also reduce significantly since the company’s 
assets might suffer a high economic rate of depreciation.  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 141 of 168 
 
 
152. We hasten to add that any delay in arriving at the conclusion that the 
company is to be liquidated is also detrimental to a Company, especially when 
the Company has long awaited timely and positive action from the successful 
resolution applicant as regards the implementation of the approved resolution 
plan. Therefore, although liquidation should be the last resort, yet one should 
also ensure that further delay in arriving at this decision does not have the 
effect of hampering the realizations that can be made through liquidation.  
   
153. The decision in Innoventive Industries Limited v. ICICI Bank and 
Another reported in (2018) 1 SCC 407 held that the Maharashtra Relief 
Undertakings (Special Provisions) Act, 1959 was repugnant to the IBC, 2016 
and elaborated on the scheme of the IBC, 2016 by placing reliance on the 2015 
Report as aforementioned. The relevant observations are reproduced 
hereinbelow:  
“13. One of the important objectives of the Code is to bring 
the insolvency law in India under a single unified umbrella 
with the object of speeding up of the insolvency process. As 
per the data available with the World Bank in 2016, 
insolvency resolution in India took 4.3 years on an average, 
which was much higher when compared with the United 
Kingdom (1 year), USA (1.5 years) and South Africa (2 
years). The World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, 
2015, ranked India as country number 135 out of 190 
countries on the ease of resolving insolvency based on 
various indicia.

16. At this stage, it is important to set out the important 
paragraphs contained in the Report of the Bankruptcy Law 
Reforms Committee of November 2015, as these excerpts 
give us a good insight into why the Code was enacted and 
the purpose for which it was enacted:

Objectives 
The Committee set the following as objectives desired from 
implementing a new Code to resolve insolvency and 
bankruptcy: 
(1) Low time to resolution. 
(2) Low loss in recovery. 
(3) Higher levels of debt financing across a wide variety of 
debt instruments.”

Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 143 of 168 
 
 
154. Several decisions of this Court have highlighted the importance of a speedy 
resolution process under the IBC, 2016 in the context of either completing the 
CIRP process in a time-bound manner as per Section 12 of the IBC, 2016 or 
ensuring that the Liquidator does not cause unnecessary delay or inefficiency 
in the Liquidation process. A primary and predominant consideration behind 
minimizing delay is to ensure that the assets of the Corporate Debtor do not 
get frittered away or depreciated due to the time lag caused either during the 
CIRP or during the liquidation process overseen by the Liquidator. Such a 
time bound action is also equally important and imperative while the 
Resolution Plan is being implemented by the successful resolution applicant. 
Unnecessary delay caused in implementation of the Resolution Plan would 
also lead to similar consequences of the assets of the corporate debtor 
diminishing in value. Therefore, there is no doubt that the timely 
implementation of the Resolution Plan is also one of the underlying objectives 
of the IBC, 2016. 
155. It is in the above context that the Rules regarding the power of the NCLT 
and NCLAT to extend time, have to be discussed. Rule 15 of the NCLT Rules, 
2016 reads as thus:  
 
“15. Power to extend time.- The Tribunal may extend the 
time appointed by these rules or fixed by any order, for doing 
any act or taking any proceeding, upon such terms, if any, as 
the justice of the case may require, and any enlargement may 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 144 of 168 
 
 
be ordered, although the application therefore is not made 
until after the expiration of the time appointed or allowed.” 
 
 
156. Rule 15 of the NCLAT Rules, 2016 reads as thus:  
“15. Power to extend time.- The Appellate Tribunal may 
extend the time appointed by these rules or fixed by any 
order, for doing any act or taking any proceeding, upon such 
terms, if any, as the justice of the case may require, and any 
enlargement may be ordered, although the application 
therefore is not made until after the expiration of the time 
appointed or allowed. 
 
 
157. Rule 15 of the NCLT and NCLAT Rules, 2016 grants power to the NCLT 
and NCLAT respectively, to extend the time limits for doing any act which 
have been fixed, either by the rules or by an order, as the justice of the case 
may require. However, such power must not be exercised mechanically 
without any application of mind. An extension on the strict timelines fixed 
under the resolution plan must be done by adequately weighing the period of 
extension sought with the consequences of such extension on the continued 
implementation of the Resolution Plan. After all, such a discretion cannot be 
exercised to the detriment of the resolution plan and its implementation itself. 
While one of the reasons supporting the grant of extension would be to ensure 
the successful revival of the corporate debtor, multiple extensions may 
seriously hamper the economic feasibility of the Resolution Plan and also lead 
to an increase in the debts of the corporate debtor. Not to mention, during the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 145 of 168 
 
 
extended period, there are several costs incurred towards maintaining the 
corporate debtor as well. The feasibility and practicability of the resolution 
plan adjudged by the “commercial wisdom” of the CoC might no longer 
remain in cases where incessant extensions are granted by the NCLT and 
NCLAT under their discretionary powers.  
 
158. The discretion in extending the time limits fixed under the Resolution Plan 
must be exercised in a much more circumspect manner, especially in cases 
such as the present, which pertains to the aviation sector, wherein timely 
resolution and revival of the Corporate Debtor is all the more crucial since the 
sector operates in such a way that a continuous flow of cash is required to 
maintain the company in a position of status quo.  
 
159. We are now left to finally consider whether in view of the gross facts on 
record, we should, in exercise of our plenary jurisdiction under Article 142 of 
the Constitution, direct that the Corporate Debtor be taken in liquidation. 
 
160. This Court in Ebix (supra) had opined that the exercise of powers, even 
under Article 142, must be broadly compliant with the insolvency framework 
and its underlying objective. It was highlighted therein that the Court must 
remain cautious in granting reliefs that may run counter to the timeliness and 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 146 of 168 
 
 
predictability that is central to the IBC, 2016. The relevant observations made 
are reproduced hereinbelow:  
 
“101. Any claim seeking an exercise of the adjudicating 
authority's residuary powers under Section 60(5)(c) IBC, 
NCLT's inherent powers under Rule 11 of the NCLT Rules, 
2016 or even the powers of this Court under Article 142 of 
the Constitution must be closely scrutinised for broader 
compliance with the insolvency framework and its 
underlying objective. The adjudicating mechanisms which 
have been specifically created by the statute, have a 
narrowly defined role in the process and must be 
circumspect in granting reliefs that may run counter to the 
timeliness and predictability that is central to IBC. Any 
judicial creation of a procedural or substantive remedy that 
is not envisaged by the statute would not only violate the 
principle of separation of powers, but also run the risk of 
altering the delicate coordination that is designed by IBC 
framework and have grave implications on the outcome of 
the CIRP, the economy of the country and the lives of the 
workers and other allied parties who are statutorily bound 
by the impact of a resolution or liquidation of a corporate 
debtor.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
161. We are conscious of our recent decision Glas Trust Company LLC v. Byju 
Raveendran and Others reported in 2024 SCC OnLine SC 3032, taking the 
view that the Court must be circumspect in deviating from the prescribed 
procedure, especially in the context of the IBC, 2016. However, if such a 
deviation is made, then the Court must justify as to why the deviation was 
necessary to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. The relevant 
observations are reproduced hereinbelow:  

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 147 of 168 
 
 
“70. When a procedure has been prescribed for a particular 
purpose exhaustively, no power shall be exercised otherwise 
than in the manner prescribed by the said provisions. In such 
cases, the court must be circumspect in invoking its ‘inherent 
powers’ to deviate from the prescribed procedure. If such 
deviation is made, the court must justify why this was 
necessary to “prevent the abuse of the process of the Court”. 
71. The need to be circumspect while invoking “inherent 
powers”, when there is an exhaustive legal framework is 
amplified in the context of a legislation like the IBC. In Ebix 
Singapore (P) Ltd. v. Educomp Solutions Ltd. (CoC), a two-
judge bench of this Court, speaking through one of us (DY 
Chandrachud, J), affirmed this position and observed as 
follows: 
“Any claim seeking an exercise of the adjudicating 
authority's residuary powers under Section 60(5)(c) IBC, 
NCLT's inherent powers under Rule 11 of the NCLT Rules 
or even the powers of this Court under Article 142 of 
the Constitution must be closely scrutinized for broader 
compliance with the insolvency framework and its 
underlying objective. The adjudicating mechanisms which 
have been specifically created by the statute, have a 
narrowly defined role in the process and must be 
circumspect in granting reliefs that may run counter to the 
timeliness and predictability that is central to the 
IBC. Any judicial creation of a procedural or substantive 
remedy that is not envisaged by the statute would not only 
violate the principle of separation of powers, but also run 
the risk of altering the delicate coordination that is 
designed by the IBC framework and have grave 
implications on the outcome of the CIRP, the economy of 
the country and the lives of the workers and other allied 
parties who are statutorily bound by the impact of a 
resolution or liquidation of a Corporate Debtor.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
162. However, the aforementioned decision should in no manner be read so as 
to restrict the exercise of plenary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 148 of 168 
 
 
even while in deviating from the statutory procedure and framework of the 
IBC, 2016 or the rules and regulations thereunder, if such deviation is very 
much necessary. This Court in Glas Trust (supra) only went so far as to say 
that, where there is a prescribed procedure in place for a particular purpose, 
then that particular thing must be done only in the manner prescribed. It no 
way lays a dictum that even where cogent reasons exist warranting such 
deviation, the court would be powerless to exercise such inherent powers. In 
other words, Glas Trust (supra) only went to the extent of saying that in the 
absence of any exceptional circumstances or extraordinary reasons 
necessitating a deviation from the procedure laid down, the court should 
refrain from invoking its inherent jurisdiction to do something which 
otherwise could have been validly done in accordance with the procedure.  
 
163. We are of the considered view that where there exists extraordinary 
circumstances warranting the exercise of such powers in order to ensure that 
the very salutary purpose of the Code, 2016 is not frustrated, then the Court 
would be well-within its prerogative to exercise them to secure the object of 
the IBC, 2016.  If the proposition that there ought to be no exercise of the 
inherent powers where a procedure is laid down were to be blanketly accepted 
then it may have a very chilling effect whereby the very purpose of vesting 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 149 of 168 
 
 
this Court with inherent powers under Article 142 and Tribunals with Rule 11 
of the NCLT Rules would be rendered otiose and meaningless. 
 
164. On account of the inordinate delay in due implementation of the Resolution 
Plan, several dues including the CIRP costs of the Corporate Debtor have 
continuously multiplied. The Appellants are incurring huge expenditure and 
costs each month towards maintenance of the Corporate Debtor. The 
fundamental concern of this Court must not only be of doing substantial and 
complete justice but also to ensure expeditious resolution of the issues in the 
interests of the underlying objective of the IBC, 2016 and all the stakeholders 
involved. We must obviate the possibility of the Corporate Debtor being stuck, 
embroiled and its resolution being further delayed, especially in light of the 
delay that has already ensued.  
 
165. Having due regard to the materials on record, a determination that the terms 
of the Resolution Plan have been contravened and that there has been a failure 
to implement on part of the SRA, has already been made on a consideration 
of the issues before us. As such, since the Resolution Plan is no longer capable 
of being implemented, we must ensure that at least liquidation remains as a 
“viable” last resort for the Corporate Debtor and its creditors. Being mindful 
of the underlying objective that “Time and Speed are of the essence under the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 150 of 168 
 
 
Code” and to prevent the frustration of this objective, we have thought fit and 
necessary to exercise our plenary powers under Article 142 and direct the 
Corporate Debtor into liquidation in the manner as laid down in the IBC, 2016. 
Granting this relief to the Appellants would not run counter to the timelines 
and predictability that is central to IBC. On the contrary, it would be in 
furtherance of it. Ensuring that liquidation commences as soon as possible 
would also be in the best interests of the Corporate Debtor and the creditors 
including the workmen/employees who are yet to receive their rightful dues. 
To be precise, it would not be necessary for the parties to again approach the 
Adjudicating Authority for a determination under Section 33(3) of the IBC, 
2016 on the ground that the provisions of the approved Resolution Plan have 
been contravened.  
 
F. SHORTCOMINGS AND SUGGESTIONS TO THE IBC, 2016.   
 
166. This litigation is an eye opener for one and all and therefore, before we 
close this matter, we deem it absolutely necessary to bring to light certain 
deficiencies in the IBC, 2016 which require immediate attention. We would 
also like to definitely say something as regards the functioning of the NCLTs 
and NCLAT.  
 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 151 of 168 
 
 
167. Given the importance of the IBC, 2016 for the betterment of the economy 
at large, it is imperative that the insolvency ecosystem be continuously 
strengthened through a regular identification of its shortcomings and a quick 
redressal of its practical deficiencies. This would significantly improve its 
implementation and yield better results for all the stakeholders involved. 
While the receptiveness of the regime to the incorporation of novel and 
relevant recommendations is important, it is paramount that there also be strict 
adherence to the existing provisions of the Code, both in letter and spirit. 
 
168. Scrupulous following of the provisions of the Code along with behavioural 
and ethical discipline is especially required from the key participants of the 
IBC who are central to its design i.e., the Adjudicating Authorities, Corporate 
Debtor, Resolution Professionals, Committee of Creditors, potential and 
Successful Resolution Applicants, Approved Valuers and Liquidators.  
 
169. A Resolution Plan evolves through these players referred to above. 
However, it is the “commercial wisdom of the CoC” that assumes a position 
of superiority and becomes binding on all the stakeholders. The NCLT, which 
is the adjudicating authority and who has to approve the Resolution Plan under 
Section 31 of the IBC, 2016 also cannot trespass into the commercial wisdom 
exercised by the CoC. This decision to restrict the scope of interference on the 
commercial wisdom of the CoC was conscious and possibly taken bearing in 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 152 of 168 
 
 
mind the time delays that may arise out of a subsequent adjudication of the 
resolution plans approved by the CoC. Therefore, the commercial wisdom of 
the CoC has achieved paramount status, immune from any judicial 
intervention, to ensure the completion of the respective processes under the 
IBC, 2016 within the timelines prescribed therein.  
 
170. The position that the “commercial wisdom” of the CoC is non-justiciable 
and only a limited judicial review is available in this regard is well-settled 
through several decisions of this Court. This Court in the case of K 
Shashidhar v. Indian Overseas Bank and Ors. reported in (2019) 12 SCC 
150, held that: 
“52. As aforesaid, upon receipt of a “rejected” 
resolution plan the adjudicating authority (NCLT) is not 
expected to do anything more; but is obligated to initiate 
liquidation process under Section 33(1) of the I&B 
Code. The legislature has not endowed the adjudicating 
authority (NCLT) with the jurisdiction or authority to 
analyse or evaluate the commercial decision of CoC 
much less to enquire into the justness of the rejection of 
the resolution plan by the dissenting financial creditors. 
From the legislative history and the background in 
which the I&B Code has been enacted, it is noticed that 
a completely new approach has been adopted for 
speeding up the recovery of the debt due from the 
defaulting companies. In the new approach, there is a 
calm period followed by a swift resolution process to be 
completed within 270 days (outer limit) failing which, 
initiation of liquidation process has been made 
inevitable and mandatory. In the earlier regime, the 
corporate debtor could indefinitely continue to enjoy the 
protection given under Section 22 of the Sick Industrial 
Companies Act, 1985 or under other such enactments 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 153 of 168 
 
 
which has now been forsaken. Besides, the commercial 
wisdom of CoC has been given paramount status 
without any judicial intervention, for ensuring 
completion of the stated processes within the timelines 
prescribed by the I&B Code. There is an intrinsic 
assumption that financial creditors are fully informed 
about the viability of the corporate debtor and 
feasibility of the proposed resolution plan. They act on 
the basis of thorough examination of the proposed 
resolution plan and assessment made by their team of 
experts. The opinion on the subject-matter expressed by 
them after due deliberations in CoC meetings through 
voting, as per voting shares, is a collective business 
decision. The legislature, consciously, has not provided 
any ground to challenge the “commercial wisdom” of 
the individual financial creditors or their collective 
decision before the adjudicating authority. That is made 
non-justiciable.”  
(emphasis supplied) 
 
171. Thus, there is no doubt that the commercial wisdom of the CoC cannot be 
subjected to judicial review. However, in order to foster a much more effective 
and time-bound decision making by the members of the CoC, in the interests 
of maximization of value of the assets of the Corporate Debtor, certain self-
regulating guidelines were issued by the IBBI on 06.08.2024 with immediate 
effect. The Guidelines for Committee of Creditors are reproduced 
hereinbelow:  
“6. Guidelines  
A member of the CoC shall: -  
 
Objectivity and Integrity  
(a) follow relevant provisions of the Code and regulations, in 
letter and spirit, while performing their roles and functions.  

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 154 of 168

envisioned under the Code.  
(c) maintain objectivity during the decision-making process.  
(d) foster informed decision making and share with the CoC/ 
Insolvency Professional any relevant information relating to

discharging his duties under the Code.  
(j) facilitate expeditious appointment of various professionals 
within the timelines prescribed under the Code and 
regulations.  
(k) endeavour to resolve any inter-se disputes between the 
members, particularly in relation to claims, preferably, 
through dialogue, or other non-adversarial means, with a 
view to avoid litigation to the extent possible. 
Confidentiality 
(l) ensure at all times complete adherence to the undertaking 
regarding confidentiality of information. 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 155 of 168 
 
 
Costs 
(m) take necessary measures to ensure that the insolvency 
resolution process cost is reasonable.  
(n) expeditiously decide on all the expenses to be incurred by the 
Insolvency Professional including the going concern 
expenses of the corporate debtor and his fee.  
(o) prudently fix the fee payable to the liquidator while deciding 
to liquidate the corporate debtor. 
Meeting of the CoC 
(p) regularly monitor the activities of the Insolvency 
Professional and seek rationale of decisions/actions taken by 
him. 
(q) diligently recommend for the inclusion or otherwise of the 
belated claims collated by the Insolvency Professional and 
categorised as acceptable, in the list of creditors and its 
treatment in the resolution plan, if any.  
(r) actively participate in the presentation of valuation 
methodologies made by the Registered Valuers.  
(s) ensure the conduct of the meeting at regular intervals as 
specified in the regulations. 
Sharing of information 
(t) proactively share the latest financial statements, relevant 
extract from the audits of the corporate debtor, conducted by 
the creditors such as stock audit, transaction audit, forensic 
audit, etc. and other relevant information available, with the 
Insolvency Professional to enable efficient conduct of the 
process.  
(u) seek details of all litigation filed against or by the corporate 
debtor from Insolvency Professional and recommend 
necessary actions to Insolvency Professional to safeguard 
the interest of the corporate debtor. 
Feasibility and viability of corporate debtor 
(v) carefully review and assess the information memorandum 
prepared by Insolvency Professional and offer additional 
insights.  

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 156 of 168 
 
 
(w) duly contribute to the preparation of the marketing strategy 
by the Insolvency Professional and may also take measures 
for marketing of the assets of the corporate debtor, if 
necessary.  
(x) ensure that all resolution plans as received by Insolvency 
Professional are placed before CoC.  
(y) suitably consider the requirement of a monitoring committee 
for the implementation of the resolution plan.” 
 
172. The aforesaid guidelines may go a long way in streamlining the functions 
of the CoC. Adding to the aforesaid guidelines, we suggest that the CoC 
exercise their commercial wisdom and approve/reject the Resolution Plans 
placed before them exhibiting fairness and with good reasons. Such a reasoned 
decision making on their part will only serve to further enable the other key 
players like the Adjudicating Authorities to understand the rationale behind 
their decision and to uphold the correctness of the same. Furthermore, it is also 
suggested that the Central Government or the IBBI explore the possibilities of 
better enforcement of the standards and practices enumerated in the guidelines 
through an independent mechanism under the auspices of an oversight 
committee instead of making them self-regulatory.  This will enable the 
guidelines to achieve some level of practical and operational relevance and 
also prevent any significant lapse in decision making on the part of the CoC.  
 
173. This litigation is an eye-opener also as regards the manner in which the 
implementation of plans are handled by the Successful Resolution Applicant 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 157 of 168 
 
 
and the Lenders involved in the process. Once a resolution plan is approved 
under the IBC, 2016 the Successful Resolution Applicant undertakes a 
profound responsibility to implement the plan in both letter and spirit. This 
obligation is not merely an empty formality but an enduring commitment to 
restore the corporate debtor to viability and ensure a meaningful turnaround. 
The role of a Successful Resolution Applicant is thus far more than a 
transactional duty towards the creditors or stakeholders; it embodies a pivotal 
responsibility to the distressed entity itself, which must be approached with 
utmost dedication and an earnest sense of duty. Regardless of the challenges 
that may arise, the Successful Resolution Applicant cannot treat its obligations 
as optional or conditional, nor can it abdicate its responsibility in the face of 
unforeseen obstacles. Its efforts must reflect a determination to implement the 
plan fully and to rejuvenate the debtor company, as this is integral to the 
success of the IBC framework and the spirit of economic revival it seeks to 
foster. The approach, therefore, must not be frugal or narrowly profit-driven, 
limited to viewing the transaction through a purely commercial lens. Instead, 
it must recognize that rescuing a distressed company is a responsibility of 
significant social and economic value, demanding a holistic and responsible 
strategy. This involves a dedication to long-term outcomes, where the 
Successful Resolution Applicant adopts measures that genuinely support the 
debtor’s rehabilitation, rather than making minimal or half-hearted attempts at 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 158 of 168 
 
 
implementation. Courts and tribunals have consistently underscored that the 
Successful Resolution Applicant’s role transcends commercial interest and 
embodies a commitment to the larger purpose of corporate revival. 
Consequently, it must make thoughtful and sustained efforts, demonstrating 
adaptability and resilience even when faced with obstacles or operational 
impediments. Simply put, the Successful Resolution Applicant cannot step 
back or dismiss its obligations by attributing delays or setbacks to the conduct 
of other stakeholders, as this would undermine the very purpose of insolvency 
resolution. 
 
174. In this collaborative effort, the duty to implement the plan does not fall on 
the Successful Resolution Applicant alone; lenders and creditors are equally 
obligated to support the process by offering constructive and continuous 
cooperation. They must not impede the implementation process through 
unnecessary demands beyond the pale of the resolution plan or with delays in 
implementation plan but rather should facilitate the Successful Resolution 
Applicant’s efforts to revive the corporate debtor. Given their vested interest 
in the corporate debtor’s successful revival, lenders have a fundamental duty 
to act in good faith and with transparency, recognizing that their cooperative 
stance is essential for overcoming the inevitable challenges of the resolution 
process. The lender's role is not merely passive; it requires active support that 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 159 of 168 
 
 
aligns with the ultimate goal of the IBC, 2016 — to provide a fair and 
equitable resolution that maximizes asset value while enabling the debtor’s 
recovery. 
 
175. Therefore, the lenders must balance their financial interests with the 
broader objective of rehabilitation. They should not take an obstructive 
approach or seek to leverage the resolution process solely for individual 
benefit, as such actions would risk destabilizing the corporate debtor’s 
recovery trajectory. Instead, they must be prepared to collaborate fully, 
sharing the responsibility to make the resolution process work in practice. 
Through a spirit of cooperation and shared purpose, the Successful Resolution 
Applicant and lenders together can ensure that the corporate debtor is given 
the best chance for revival and sustained growth, reflecting the Code’s intent 
to rescue viable companies and protect broader economic interests. 
 
176. The IBC, 2016 is silent as regards the phase of implementation of the 
Resolution Plan by the Successful Resolution Applicant. This is mostly due to 
the fact that each Resolution Plan might be unique and customized to the 
specific needs of the Corporate Debtor and an excessive amount of statutory 
control over the implementation of the Plan may prove to be 
counterproductive to the cause of the Corporate Debtor. However, this has 
unfortunately led to the consequence of giving excessive leeway to the 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 160 of 168 
 
 
Successful Resolution Applicants to act in flagrant violation of the terms of 
the Resolution Plan in a lackadaisical manner. The SRAs repeatedly approach 
the Adjudicating Authority or the NCLAT for the grant of reliefs in relation 
to relaxation of the strict compliance to the terms of the Plan, including the 
timelines imposed therein. The NCLT and NCLAT more often than not, 
accede to such requests in exercise of their inherent powers under Rule 11 or 
their power to extend time under Rule 15 of the NCLT and NCLAT Rules, 
2016 respectively. It is reiterated that the NCLT and NCLAT must not 
entertain such repeated attempts at violating the integrity of a CoC approved 
Resolution Plan by accommodating the incessant requests of the Successful 
Resolution Applicants. The exercise of discretion as regards altering the 
binding terms of the Resolution Plan, including the timelines imposed, must 
be kept at a minimum, at best. The NCLTs/ NCLATs need to be sensitised of 
not exercising their judicial discretion in extending the timelines fixed under 
IBC, 2016 or the Resolution Plan, in such a way that it may make the Code 
lose its effectiveness thereby rendering it obsolete. 
 
177. Section 30(2)(d) of the IBC, 2016 states that the resolution professional 
shall mandatorily examine each resolution plan that is received to confirm that 
it provides for the implementation and supervision of the resolution plan. 
Regulation 38 of the 2016 Regulations provides for the mandatory contents of 
a Resolution Plan. Regulation 38(2) specifically states that the Resolution Plan 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 161 of 168 
 
 
shall provide for the term of the plan and its implementation schedule, along 
with adequate means for supervising its implementation. Further, under 
Regulation 38(3), a resolution plan must demonstrate that it addresses the 
cause of default, is feasible and viable, has provisions for its effective 
implementation, has provisions for approvals required and the timelines for 
the same and, that the resolution applicant has the capability to implement the 
resolution plan. Therefore, in light of these provisions of the IBC, 2016 and 
the 2016 Regulations, it can be seen that the resolution plan must be 
impermeable to any shortcuts that prevent its implementation, including 
timely implementation, by the successful resolution applicant. A 
consideration of these provisions reinforces the idea that timely 
implementation and strict adherence to the terms of the resolution plan is 
crucial.  
 
178. Furthermore, Section 74(3) of the IBC, 2016 provides for the punishment 
for contravention of the resolution plan and reads as follows:  
 
“(3) Where the corporate debtor, any of its officers or 
creditors or any person on whom the approved resolution 
plan is binding under section 31, knowingly and wilfully 
contravenes any of the terms of such resolution plan or abets 
such contravention, such corporate debtor, officer, creditor 
or person shall be punishable with imprisonment of not less 
than one year, but may extend to five years, or with fine 
which shall not be less than one lakh rupees, but may extend 
to one crore rupees, or with both.” 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 162 of 168 
 
 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
179. The Code comes down heavily on any knowing and willful contravention 
of the terms of the Resolution Plan, committed by any person, on whom the 
approved Resolution Plan has been made binding under Section 31 of the IBC, 
2016. A punishment of minimum one year which may extend up to five years 
or minimum fine of one Lakh which may be up to one Crore rupees, or both, 
has been prescribed for such a contravention. In light of such strict 
consequence provided for the contravention of the resolution plan envisaged 
under the scheme of the Code itself, there is good reason for us to ensure that 
the successful resolution applicants abide by their commitments made under 
the Resolution Plan. Therefore, it is suggested that the authorities including 
the NCLT and NCLAT must not aid the Successful Resolution Applicants in 
circumventing the strict mandates of the law by acceding to their requests to 
relax the terms of the plan itself.  
 
180. One another suggestion at our end that may aid in a coordinated and non-
adversarial implementation of the Resolution Plan by all the stakeholders is 
that the Adjudicating Authority while approving a Resolution Plan under 
Section 31 of the IBC, 2016, should record the next steps which are to be taken 
by the respective parties for commencement of implementation of the 
approved Resolution Plan. This will ensure that the parties are ad idem about 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 163 of 168 
 
 
the next round of their obligations that each of them is required to discharge 
under the approved Resolution Plan and that they do not delay the 
implementation by initiating any further litigation on this aspect. If such an 
approach is adopted, the parties would be able to put forth any difficulty that 
they might face in performing those next steps before the NCLT itself and 
seek necessary relief in that regard. Recording the next steps that are to be 
undertaken in the order of the Adjudicating Authority, will keep the parties 
more vigilant since a non-performance of the obligation may lead to a 
violation of the terms of the approved Resolution Plan and also violation of 
the order approving the Resolution Plan as well.  
 
181. As regards the implementation of the approved Resolution Plan, it is 
suggested that the IBC, 2016 statutorily provide for the constitution of a 
Monitoring Committee, once the plan has been approved, for a smooth 
handover of the Corporate Debtor to the Successful Resolution Applicant. 
Presently, such a provision is absent in the Code and it is the Adjudicating 
Authority that orders for the constitution of a Monitoring Committee to ensure 
smooth implementation of the Plan. The CoC must be empowered to 
constitute the Monitoring Committee which may, by default, include the 
Resolution Professional and also include other nominees from the CoC and 
the Resolution Applicant respectively. Such a Monitoring Committee would 
be entrusted with the powers of monitoring and supervising the resolution plan 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 164 of 168 
 
 
till the expiry of the term of the Resolution Plan. The Committee shall also be 
required to ensure all statutory compliances during the implementation of the 
plan along with updating the Adjudicating Authorities, Financial and other 
Creditors about the status of implementation of the Resolution Plan, on a 
quarterly basis.  
 
182. Moving on to certain efficiency issues within the NCLTs and NCLAT, it 
has been noticed over a period of time that there is a serious lack of timely 
admission and disposal of the applications filed as regards the initiation of 
CIRP, approval of the resolution plan and liquidation. This only adds to the 
uncertainty of the process and prolongs the dispute thereby jeopardizing the 
interest of all the stakeholders involved. Adjudication in a time-bound manner 
would help prevent any further deterioration of the value of the corporate 
entity.  The integrity of the original timelines laid down by the Code and the 
Resolution Plan must not be allowed to be violated since it would dilute the 
objective of the Code in its entirety, erode investor confidence and hinder all 
corporate restructuring efforts.  
 
183. The Members often lack the domain knowledge required to appreciate the 
nuanced complexities involved in high-stake insolvency matters in order to 
properly adjudicate such matters. It has been noticed that the benches of 
NCLT(s) and NCLAT don’t have the practice of sitting for the full working 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 165 of 168 
 
 
hours. They are particularly lacking in the capacity to manage the growing 
number of cases and giving undivided attention required in such matters. 
There are serious issues in the manner in which the insolvency matters are 
listed. There is no effective system in place before the NCLTs for urgent 
listings. The staff of the Registry is given wide power to list or not to list a 
particular matter. One of the salutary objects of the Code, 2016 is to protect 
the assets of the corporate entity in a timely manner and take prompt decisions, 
however, it has become a practice of the NCLT(s) and NCLAT to ignore the 
urgent mentionings and listings of time-sensitive matters and show no 
deference to long-pending matters resulting in value erosion of the assets of 
the Corporate Debtor and rendering their insolvency resolution process a 
foregone conclusion. Over a period of time, this Court has noticed the growing 
tendency amongst Members of the NCLT(s) and NCLAT to ignore the orders 
of this Court or act in its defiance. We put the NCLT(s) and the NCLAT to 
notice, that any act of contravention of this Court’s order and the larger rubric 
of judicial propriety will not be tolerated. The NCLT(s) and the NCLAT must 
seriously rethink their approach towards admission and disposal of insolvency 
matters, they should not act as a mere rubberstamping authority and must take 
their roles seriously in ensuring time-bound hearings and resolutions. Proper 
and effective hearings, both virtually and in-court, must be given to insolvency 

 
Civil Appeal Nos. 5023-5024 of 2024                                                            Page 166 of 168 
 
 
matters of public importance, and the NCLT(s) and NCLAT(s) must earnestly 
work towards ensuring that the IBC, 2016 achieves its avowed object. 
 
184. One another serious issue pertaining to the functioning of the NCLTs and 
NCLAT is that there is often a shortage of members in the Tribunals and 
inadequate infrastructure to support their functioning. These vacancies heavily 
impact the insolvency reform initiative undertaken by the government since 
they lead to operational inefficiencies. A shortfall of members and the lack of 
requisite strength has led to Tribunals only sitting for a few days of the week 
or a few hours in a day. Even in Tribunals where there is no vacancy, the 
absence of requisite infrastructure has forced the benches to share courtrooms 
or halls on a rotation basis. As a consequence, the strict timelines provided in 
Section 12 of the IBC, 2016 are not complied with. Filling such vacancies with 
experts having adequate domain knowledge in the field must be prioritized 
along with addressing the infrastructure needs of the Tribunals to prevent any 
adverse effect on the resolution process. There must be strict mandates 
regarding the functioning of the Tribunals within its normal working hours.  
The appointment of new members must be done in a manner such that it 
coincides with the date of retirement of the sitting members in a seamless 
manner to avoid such operational inefficiencies. Persons with high ideals & 
impeccable integrity should be appointed as Members in the NCLT as well as 
NCLAT. There should not be any political appointment.

185. It is now for the Parliament to look into our suggestions in consultation 
with the Insolvency Bankruptcy Board of India and the Ministry of Finance. 
 
G. CONCLUSION 
 
186. For all the foregoing reasons, we have reached the conclusion that the 
impugned order passed by the NCLAT is perverse and unsustainable in law. 
It has led to further complications. As a result, the appeals succeed and are 
allowed. The impugned order passed by the NCLAT is set aside.  
 
187. In the peculiar and alarming circumstances as discussed in this judgment 
and also keeping in mind the fact that almost five years have elapsed since the 
Resolution Plan was duly approved by the NCLAT and there being no 
progress worth the name, we are left with no other option but to invoke our 
jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution and direct that the Corporate 
Debtor be taken in liquidation. The NCLT, Mumbai shall now take 
appropriate steps for appointment of liquidator and all other necessary 
formalities for commencement of liquidation of the Corporate Debtor. 
 
188. The amount of Rs 200 Crore already infused by the SRA stands forfeited. 
The Lenders/ Creditors are further permitted to encash the Performance Bank 
Guarantee of Rs. 150 Crore furnished by the SRA. We accordingly order so.

judgment more particularly the suggestions made by this Court.
