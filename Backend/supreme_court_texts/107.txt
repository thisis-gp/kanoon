This appeal arises out of an order passed by the learned Single Judge 
of the High Court of Judicature at Madras dated 6th September 2021 in 
CRLRC No.413 of 2019, by which interference in the order of the Additional 
District & Sessions Judge, Tiruvallur1 dated 16th April, 2019 has been 
refused. The lower Appellate Court had modified the order of the Chief 
Judicial Magistrate2 dated 23rd November 2018 in as much as it set aside the 
appellant’s conviction under Section 18 (c) read with Section 27 (b)(ii) of

the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 19403 while confirming the conviction and 
sentence in regard to Section 18(A) read with Section 28, of the said Act.  
3. 
A brief review of facts, as borne out by the judgments of the Courts 
below is necessary for adjudication of the instant dispute.  
3.1 One Palani4 ran a clinic which on 13th October, 2015 was 
inspected by the officials of the State, viz. The Pallippattu Range 
Drug Inspector; Joint Director, Tiruvallur District Health 
Department; Zone Drug Inspector Poonamallee.  
3.2 The inspection found 29 types of allopathic medicines meant 
for distribution without the proper paperwork (license) for sale. 
Moreover, upon being questioned as to the source of procurement 
of these medicines, details remained unfurnished.  
3.3 The Drug Inspector, Pallippattu filed a complaint under 
Section 200 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 under the Sections 
noted above. Prosecution was initiated on the basis of 6 witnesses; 
12 Exhibits and with the 29 types of medicines (a small quantity5) 
recovered, being marked as material objects.  
 
3 Hereinafter referred to as ‘The Act’ 
4 Referred to as ‘The Appellant’ 
5  Annexure P-1 

3|SLP(Crl)No.256 of 2022 
 
 
3.4 Upon consideration of the evidence presented, the Trial Court 
found the case of the prosecution to have been proved beyond 
reasonable doubt and, therefore, the Appellant was sentenced to two 
years rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs. 1,00,000/-. In 
default whereof, he was to undergo three months simple 
imprisonment for the offences under Section 18(c) read with 
Section 27(b)(ii).  For the offence under Section 18A read with 28 
of the Act, the sentence was six months simple imprisonment with 
a fine of Rs. 20,000/- with one-month simple imprisonment in 
default. Sentences awarded were concurrent in nature. Further, a 
cost of Rs.2500/- stood imposed for newspaper publication under 
Section 35 of the said Act.  
3.5 On appeal, the learned Additional District & Sessions Judge, 
i.e., the lower Appellate Court was faced primarily with the issue, 
of whether it has been proved that the drugs recovered were in the 
possession of the appellant for the purpose of sale/distribution.   
3.6 In deciding this question, the Court noted that no patients or 
any other persons were examined to establish that the drugs so 
confiscated were actually sold. No bills/receipts were produced. It 
was noted that PW5 as also PW3 testified to the fact that the 
Appellant was running a medical shop, but it was observed that no 

4|SLP(Crl)No.256 of 2022 
 
 
proof had been offered to show that the drugs in the clinic were for 
sale. The Court also relied on Ex. P-10 (letter of the accused to the 
Drug Inspector) referred to as A-10 in its judgment, to state that 
there is only admission of possession but none for sale/distribution. 
It was, therefore, observed that no evidence has been put forth by 
the complainant in regard to sale and/or distribution. The offence 
under Section 18 (c) of the Act was, therefore, not proven.  
3.7 The conviction and sentence in this regard was set aside while 
others were confirmed. Accordingly, it was held that the Appellant 
was entitled to a refund of Rs. 1,00,000/-. 
4. 
A criminal revision case stood filed against the judgment and order 
of the lower Appellate Court. It was observed that the scope of a Revisional 
Court is limited and is not akin to an Appellate Court. On account of the 
absence of any perversity or infirmity in the order of the lower Courts, the 
revision was dismissed. A further prayer was made to set aside the conviction 
and sentence under Section 18(A) of the Act and vice it, a fine could be 
imposed. The same was rejected.  
5. 
Hence, the present appeal. 

5|SLP(Crl)No.256 of 2022 
 
 
6. 
 We have heard Mr. S. Nagamuthu, learned senior counsel and Mr. 
M.P. Parthiban, learned counsel for the appellant and Dr. Joseph Aristotle, 
learned senior counsel for the respondent-State.  
7. 
Before us, there is not a serious challenge to the conviction itself. 
However, it is submitted that the appellant, being a doctor, had no ill 
intention (mens rea) to contravene the law and undertake any action which 
may be scuttling the statutory provisions. It is as such prayed that the 
sentence of imprisonment be modified to that of a fine.  
8. 
A proper sentence, as has been observed by this Court in Mohammad 
Giassudin  v.  State of Andhra Pradesh6 is an amalgam of many factors 
pertaining to the offence itself as also others such as prior record if any, age, 
record of employment, education, home life, social adjustment and 
emotional and mental conditions of the offender etc.  
9. 
At present, the impugned judgment as it stands, convicts the 
Appellant under Section 18A read with Section 28 of the Act.  Both these 
provisions concern the disclosure or non-disclosure respectively of the name 
of the manufacturer.  The former stipulates a requirement for every person 
who is not a manufacturer or agent of distribution to disclose the name of the 
person from whom he has acquired such drug or cosmetic.  The latter 
 
6 (1977) 3 SCC 287 

6|SLP(Crl)No.256 of 2022 
 
 
imposes a punishment for violation of the aforesaid requirement to the tune 
of imprisonment up to a year or with a fine not less than Rs.20,000/-, or with 
both.   
10. 
In the present case, the punishment imposed is six months simple 
imprisonment with the minimum statutory fine.   
11. 
It is not in dispute that the Appellant is a doctor.  We notice that this 
Court in S. Athilakshmi v. State Rep. by The Drug Inspector7 had 
acquitted a doctor of stocking a small amount of drug as the same was not 
slated to be equal to selling medicines across the counter in a shop.  This 
offence, as already noted above, was found not proved by the lower 
Appellate Court.  
12. 
The only aspect which remains is a non-disclosure of the name of the 
manufacturer.  We find that the quantities of the 29 kinds of medicines 
recovered from the clinic run by the Appellant, were of small quantity.  In 
such a situation, non-disclosure of the name of the manufacturer/person from 
whom the said medicines were acquired, cannot be said to be endangering 
public interest (which obviously, is the primary object of the prohibition in 
law) by allowing the circulation of such substances unauthorizedly.

13.  
In the attending facts and circumstances, considering that the 
Appellant is a doctor and also keeping in view the observations of this Court 
in Mohammad Giassudin (supra), we are of the considered view that 
imposing a sentence of imprisonment would be unjustified, particularly 
when the intent to sell/distribute under Section 18(c) of the Act has been held 
unproven.  Therefore, we find it fit to modify the impugned judgment, set 
aside the sentence of imprisonment as awarded, and instead thereof, impose 
a fine of Rs.1,00,000/- on the Appellant.     
14. 
The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.  The exemption 
from surrendering granted by this Court vide order dated 7th January, 2022 is 
made absolute.   Pending application(s) if any, shall stand disposed of.
