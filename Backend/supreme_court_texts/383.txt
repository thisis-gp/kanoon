Since the issues raised in both the captioned appeals are the same, the
parties  are  also  the  same  and  the  challenge  is  also  to  the  self-same
judgment and order passed by the High Court, those were taken up for
hearing analogously and are being disposed of by this common order.
 
3
The appellant before this Court is the original first informant (complainant).
The  appellant  lodged  a  First  Information  Report  No  I-179/2012  at  the
Surendranagar City Police Station for the offence punishable under Sections
147, 148, 149, 427, 323, 325, 506(2), 384 of the Indian Penal Code1 and
Section 135 of the Gujarat Police Act. The FIR was lodged in all against five
accused persons.
 
4
The respondents before this Court are the original accused Nos 1 and 2
respectively. Out of the five accused persons, two were named in the FIR,

whereas three were not named. The respondents herein ultimately were put
to trial for the offence punishable under Sections 147, 148, 149, 329, 384,
387, 427, 506(2), 323 and 325 respectively of the IPC and Section 135 of the
Bombay Police Act.
5
The respondents herein came to be convicted by the Sessions Court for the
offence punishable under Section 325 of the IPC and were sentenced to
undergo rigorous imprisonment of five years with fine of Rs 5,000/- each. The
trial court also convicted the respondents for the offence punishable under
Section  323  of  the  IPC  and  sentenced  them  to  undergo  rigorous
imprisonment for a period of one year and for the offence punishable under
Section  135  of  the  Gujarat  Police  Act,  they  came  to  be  sentenced  with
rigorous imprisonment of one year with fine of Rs 1,000/-. 
6
The original accused Nos 3, 4, and 5, who were not named in the FIR came to
be acquitted by the trial court. 
7
Against the judgment and order of conviction passed by the trial court, the
respondents herein went in appeal before the High Court. 
8
The two captioned appeals before this Court originate from Criminal Appeal
(For Enhancement) No 906 of 2014 and Criminal Appeal No 1330 of 2014
decided by the High Court.
 
9
These two appeals, i.e. Criminal Appeal Nos 906 of 2014 and 1330 of 2014
respectively  came  to  be  preferred  by  the  appellant  herein,  one  for
enhancement of sentence and the connected appeal against the order of
acquittal so far as the original accused Nos 3 to 5 are concerned. It may not
2

SLPR 2653-54/2016
be out of place to state at this stage that the respondents as original convicts
also preferred Criminal Appeal Nos 723 of 2014 and 733 of 2014 respectively
against the order of conviction and sentence.
10
The High Court heard in all five appeals, two filed by the appellant herein,
two filed by the respondents and the fifth appeal was filed by the State of
Gujarat. The acquittal appeal filed by the State of Gujarat was against the
original accused Nos 3 to 5. The High Court disposed of all the five appeals
by  a  common  judgment.  The  operative  part  of  the  judgment  and  order
passed by the High Court reads thus:
“(a) The  impugned  judgment  and  order  dated  31.05.2014
passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Surendranagar in
Sessions Case No.14/2013 is modified only to the extent
that sentence imposed upon both original accused no.1 &
2 for conviction u/s.325 IPC is reduced from Five Years to
Four Years, without disturbing the order regarding fine and
default  sentence.  Rest  of  the  impugned  judgment  and
order remains unaltered.
(b)
Considering  the  principle  rendered  by  Apex  Court  in
Ankush Shivaji Gaikwad v. State of Maharashtra, 2013 (6)
SCC 770 and the request made by learned counsel Mr.
Hriday Buch that both Rs.2.50 lacs each, totalling Rs.5.00
Lacs  (Rupees  Five  Lacs  only),  to  the  victim  under  the
provisions  of  Section  357  Cr.P.C.,  we  do  not  find  any
reasons in the facts and circumstances of the case for
denying the said benefit in favour of both accused no.1 &
2.
(c)
Accordingly,  while  granting  benefit  of  the  judgment
rendered  in  Ankush  Shivaji  Gaikwad’s  case  (supra)  to
original  accused  no.1  &  2,  it  is  directed  that  if  both
accused no.1 & 2 deposit a sum of Rs.2.50 lacs each,
totalling Rs.5.00 Lacs (Rupees Five lacs only), before the
Registry of the concerned Sessions Court, within a period
of TEN WEEKS from today, which, in turn, shall be paid as
compensation to the victim, then both accused no.1 & 2
are  not  required  to  undergo  the  remainder  sentence
imposed  upon  them,  which  has  been  modified  by  this
Court  as  aforesaid.  On  such  deposit  being  made,  the
Registry of concerned Sessions Court shall pay the entire
3

SLPR 2653-54/2016
amount to the victim, after due verification. It is clarified
that if any one or both the accused persons fail to deposit
the amount as aforesaid, they shall surrender to custody
on  expiry  of  the  aforesaid  period  failing  which  the
investigating  agency  shall  take  necessary  steps  for
sending them to jail custody. The impugned judgment and
order stands modified accordingly.”
11
Thus, it appears that the sentence of five years’ imprisonment as imposed by
the trial court came to be reduced to four years. The High Court further held
that if an amount of Rs 2.50 lakh is paid by each of the two respondents
before it, then the respondents need not undergo even the four years’ of
sentence as reduced by the High Court. 
12
In such circumstances referred to above, the appellant (original complainant)
is before this Court with the present appeals. 
13
Mr Harin P Raval, the learned senior counsel appearing for the complainant
vehemently  submitted  that  what  has  been  done  by  the  High  Court  is
something  impermissible  in  law.  The  amount  of  compensation  which  is
awarded  to  the  victim  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  substantive  order  of
sentence which the court imposes upon holding the accused guilty of the
alleged offence. According to Mr Raval, the High Court having reduced the
sentence of five years as imposed by the trial court to four years could not
have  further  modified  the  order  of  sentence  on  the  premise  that  the
respondents are ready and willing to pay an amount of Rs 5 lakh by way of
compensation to the victim. He further submitted that the reliance placed by
the High Court on the decision of this Court in the case of Ankush Shivaji
Gaikwad vs State of Maharashtra2, is completely misplaced. 
2

4

SLPR 2653-54/2016
14
In such circumstances referred to above, Mr Raval prayed that the impugned
judgment of the High Court be set aside and the respondents be asked to
undergo sentence of four years’ rigorous imprisonment. 
15
On the other hand, these appeals have been vehemently opposed by Mr
Purvish Malkan, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents (original
accused persons). He would submit that no error much less an error of law
could be said to have been committed by the High Court in passing the
impugned order. He also submitted that it’s been now twelve years since the
incident had occurred. He also submitted that the amount of Rs 5 lakh has
been deposited before the trial court. 
16
In such circumstances referred to above, he prayed that there being no merit
in these appeals, the same may be dismissed. 
ANALYSIS
17
Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone
through  the  materials  on  record,  the  only  question  that  falls  for  our
consideration  is  whether  the  procedure  adopted  by  the  High  Court,  as
reflected in paragraph 19 of the operative part of the order, could be said to
be in accordance with law.
 
18
Section 357of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 reads thus:
“357.  Order  to  pay  compensation.—(1)  When  a  Court
imposes a sentence of fine or a sentence (including a sentence
of death) of which fine forms a part, the Court may, when
5

SLPR 2653-54/2016
passing  judgment,  order  the  whole  or  any  part  of  the  fine
recovered to be applied—
(a) 
in defraying the expenses properly incurred in the
prosecution;
(b) 
in the payment to any person of compensation for
any  loss  or  injury  caused  by  the  offence,  when
compensation  is,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Court,
recoverable by such person in a civil court;
(c) 
when  any  person  is  convicted  of  any  offence  for
having  caused  the  death  of  another  person  or  of
having abetted the commission of such an offence, in
paying compensation to the persons who are, under
the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 (13 of 1855), entitled to
recover damages from the person sentenced for the
loss resulting to them from such death;
(d) 
when any person is convicted of any offence which
includes  theft,  criminal  misappropriation,  criminal
breach of trust, or cheating, or of having dishonestly
received or retained, or of having voluntarily assisted
in disposing of, stolen property knowing or having
reason  to  believe  the  same  to  be  stolen,  in
compensating  any  bona  fide  purchaser  of  such
property for the loss of the same if such property is
restored  to  the  possession  of  the  person  entitled
thereto.
(2) If the fine is imposed in a case which is subject to appeal,
no such payment shall be made before the period allowed for
presenting  the  appeal  has  elapsed,  or,  if  an  appeal  be
presented, before the decision of the appeal.
(3) When a Court imposes a sentence, of which fine does not
form a part, the Court may, when passing judgment, order the
accused person to pay, by way of compensation, such amount
as may be specified in the order to the person who has suffered
any loss or injury by reason of the act for which the accused
person has been so sentenced.
(4)  An  order  under  this  section  may  also  be  made  by  an
Appellate Court or by the High Court or Court of Session when
exercising its powers of revision.
(5) At the time of awarding compensation in any subsequent
civil suit relating to the same matter, the Court shall take into
account any sum paid or recovered as compensation under this
section.”

SLPR 2653-54/2016
19
Way back in 1981, this Court speaking through Krishna Iyer, J. in Maru Ram
vs Union of India & Others3, held that while social responsibility of the
criminal to restore the loss or heal the injury is part of the punitive exercise;
the length of the prison term is no reparation to the crippled or bereaved and
is futility compounded with cruelty. Section 357 provides power to award
compensation to victims of the offence out of the sentence of fine imposed
on accused. Time and again this Court has reiterated that it is an important
provision but courts seldom invoke the same. It empowers the court to award
compensation to victims while passing judgment of conviction. In addition to
conviction, the court may order the accused to pay some amount by way of
compensation to victim who has suffered by the action of accused. 
20
In  Hari Singh vs Sukhbir Singh and Others4, this Court held that the
power to award compensation under Section 357 of the CrPC is not ancillary
to other sentences, but it is in addition thereto. This power was intended to
do something to reassure the victim that he or she is not forgotten in the
criminal justice system. As observed in Hari Singh (supra), it is a measure
of responding appropriately to crime as well as of reconciling the victim with
the offender. It is, a constructive approach to crimes.
 
21
The  High  Court  having  upheld  the  conviction  for  the  offence  punishable
under  Section  325  of  the  IPC  so  far  as  the  two  respondents  herein  are
concerned  and  having  reduced  the  sentence  from  five  years  rigorous
imprisonment to four years rigorous imprisonment could not have further
diluted  the  order  of  sentence  by  asking  the  accused  persons  to  pay
3
(1981) 1 SCC 107
4(1988) 4 SCC 551
7

SLPR 2653-54/2016
compensation.  In  other  words,  the  High  Court  having  once  affirmed  the
conviction and awarded sentence of four years could not have further in lieu
of the same reduced it by ordering compensation. To this extent, we have no
hesitation in holding that the High Court fell into error. 
22
The idea of victim compensation is based on the theory of victimology which
recognizes  the  harsh  reality  that  victims  are  unfortunately  the  forgotten
people  in  the  criminal  justice  delivery  system.  Victims  are  the  worst
sufferers. Victims‟ family is ruined particularly in cases of death and grievous
bodily  injuries.  This  is  apart  from  the  factors  like  loss  of  reputation,
humiliation,  etc.  Theory  of  Victimology  seeks  to  redress  the  same  and
underscores  the  importance  for  criminal  justice  administration  system  to
take into consideration the effect of the offence on the victim's family even
though human life cannot be restored but then monetary compensation will
at least provide some solace.
23
The provision of Section 357 recognizes the aforesaid and is victim centric in
nature. It has nothing to do with the convict or the sentence passed. The
spotlight  is  on  the  victim  only.  The  object  of  victim  compensation  is  to
rehabilitate those who have suffered any loss or injury by the offence which
has  been  committed.  Payment  of  victim  compensation  cannot  be  a
consideration  or  a  ground  for  reducing  the  sentence  imposed  upon  the
accused  as  victim  compensation  is  not  a  punitive  measure  and  only
restitutory in nature and thus, has no bearing with the sentence that has
been passed which is punitive in nature. 
8

SLPR 2653-54/2016
24
The  words  “any  loss  or  injury”  used  in  Section  357  of  the  CrPC  clearly
indicates that the sole factor for deciding the compensation to be paid is the
victim’s loss or injury as a result of the offence, and has nothing to do with
the  sentence that  has  been passed.  Section  357  of  CrPC  is  intended to
reassure  the  victim  that  he/she  is  not  forgotten  in  the  criminal  justice
system. It is a constructive approach to crimes based on the premise that
mere punishment of the offender may not give solace to the victim or its
family.
25
As such, when deciding the compensation which is to be paid to a victim, the
only  factor  that  the  court  may  take  into  consideration  is  the  convict’s
capacity  to  pay  the  compensation  and  not  the  sentence  that  has  been
imposed. In criminal proceedings the courts should not conflate sentence
with compensation to victims. Sentences such as imprisonment and / or fine
are imposed independently of any victim compensation and thus, the two
stand on a completely different footing, either of them cannot vary the other.
Where an accused is directed to pay compensation to victims, the same is
not meant as punishment or atonement of the convict but rather as a step
towards  reparation  to  the  victims  who  have  suffered  from  the  offence
committed by the convict.
26
If payment of compensation becomes a consideration for reducing sentence,
then  the  same  will  have  a  catastrophic  effect  on  the  criminal  justice
administration. It will result in criminals with a purse full of money to buy
their way out of justice, defeating the very purpose of criminal proceedings.
   
9

SLPR 2653-54/2016
27
Having held so as above, the last question that falls for our consideration is
how do we modify the order of the High Court. According to Mr Raval that
part of the High Court’s order be set aside and the respondents be directed
to undergo sentence of four years’ rigorous imprisonment. 
28
We could have easily done as submitted by Mr Raval, but in the facts and
circumstances of the case, more particularly, keeping in mind that a period
of twelve years has elapsed and when the respondents (original convicts)
have already deposited the amount of Rs 5 lakh, we are not inclined to direct
the respondents to undergo further sentence of four years. However, having
said so, we direct each of the respondents to deposit a further sum of Rs 5
lakh, i.e. in all Rs 10 lakh, in addition to what they have already deposited
before the trial court. This deposit shall be made within a period of eight
weeks from today. The trial court shall disburse the entire amount of Rs 15
lakh to the appellant herein (original complainant) after proper identification.
29
With the aforesaid, the appeals are disposed of.                    
30
Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
