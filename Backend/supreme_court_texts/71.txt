O R D E R 
SATISH CHANDRA SHARMA, J. 
1. 
Leave granted. 
2. 
The present appeal(s) culminate out of a common order dated 11.11.2016 
whereunder the High Court of Rajasthan (the “High Court”) enhanced the award 
of maintenance granted to the Appellant by the Family Court at Jaipur under 
Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (the “Act”) from 
Rs.3,000/- (Rupees Three Thousand) per month to (i) Rs.6,000/- (Rupees Six 
Thousand) from the date of filing the application before the High Court i.e., 
16.05.2009 up until 31.12.2005; and (ii) Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand) per 
month from 01.01.2006 onwards (the “Impugned Order”). 
3. 
The Appellant herein seeks an enhancement of maintenance awarded by 
the High Court on the ground that the maintenance awarded by the High Court is 
inadequate and does not reflect the true financial capacity of the Respondent. 
4. 
The marriage between the Appellant and Respondent came to be 
solemnized on 27.04.1982, thereafter 3 (three) children came to borne out of the 
wedlock i.e., (i) Abhishek; (ii) Aashish; and (iii) Nikki. Subsequently in 1998, the 
marriage encountered complications which led to the parties residing separately. 
Pertinently, the Respondent chose to reside with 2 (two) of his major children,

namely (i) Abhishek; and (ii) Aashish. Accordingly, the Respondent left the 
Appellant and Nikki i.e., a minor, to fend for themselves.  
5. 
In the aforesaid circumstances, the Respondent filed an application under 
Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (the “HMA”) seeking dissolution of 
the marriage between the parties. Vide an order dated 31.05.2005, an ex-parte 
decree came to be passed in favour of the Respondent. Thereafter, the Respondent 
married another lady on 20.07.2007.  
6. 
In the interregnum, the Appellant preferred an application before the 
Family Court, Jaipur seeking maintenance under Section 18 and Section 20 of the 
Act. Vide an order dated 15.04.2009, the Family Court, Jaipur allowed the 
Appellants’ application, and accordingly granted maintenance as follows:  
(i) 
Appellant: Rs.3,000/- (Rupees Three Thousand) per month w.e.f from 
15.04.2009;  
(ii) 
Nikki: Rs.5,000/- (Rupees Five Thousand) per month w.e.f from 
15.04.2009 until Nikki attained the age of majority; and  
(iii) Litigation Cost: Rs.2,000/- (Rupees Two Thousand) 
 
(hereinafter referred to as the “Underlying Order”) 
7. 
Subsequently, an application under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (the “CPC”) came to be preferred by the Appellant. Vide an 
order dated 09.09.2011, in the aforesaid application, the ex-parte order decreeing 
the divorce in favour of the Respondent came to be set aside; and accordingly, the 
application under Section 13 of the HMA preferred by the Respondent was 
restored.  
8. 
The parties preferred cross-appeal(s) against the Underlying Order of the 
Family Court, Jaipur which came to be disposed of by the High Court vide the 
Impugned Order. In the present appeal, the Appellant has drawn the attention of 
this Court to the considerable salary that the Respondent was drawing from 
Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (“BSNL”), whilst dragging his feet in relation to 
his obligations qua maintenance under the Impugned Order.

9. 
The Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant has submitted 
that the Respondents’ salary has increased significantly. In this regard he has 
relied upon a Right to Information (“RTI”) application filed with BSNL, 
whereunder it is revealed that the Respondent was last drawing a handsome salary 
of Rs.1,05,871/- (Rupees One Lakh Five Thousand Eight Hundred and Seventy-
One) per month whilst serving as Assistant Manager, BSNL. Accordingly, it is 
prayed that the maintenance awarded by the High Court ought to be enhanced 
further. Pertinently, it was also brought to the attention of this Court that the 
arrear(s) of maintenance have not been paid to the Appellant despite a categorical 
direction from the High Court to clear the arrear(s) of maintenance within 1 (one) 
year from date of the Impugned Order i.e., on or before 11.11.2017.  
10. 
On the other hand, the Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the 
Respondent submitted that the Respondent has since attained the age of 
superannuation and accordingly, no longer receives the aforementioned salary. It 
was submitted that the Respondent is only drawing pension from BSNL; and that 
the maintenance granted by the High Court ought not to be interfered with.  
11. 
Considering the position of the parties and the totality of circumstances 
surrounding the present appeal(s), we are of the considered view that the 
Appellant should be granted a sum of Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) per 
month as maintenance with effect from the date of this Order. 
12. 
We accordingly allow the appeal(s) preferred by the Appellant and enhance 
the monthly maintenance payable under Section 18 of the Act from Rs.10,000/- 
(Rupees Ten Thousand) per month to Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) per 
month with effect from the date of the pronouncement of this Order. Furthermore, 
the arrears payable in respect of the maintenance due to the Appellant shall be 
payable in equal instalments by the Respondent in addition to the regular 
maintenance as quantified by us above.

13. 
Resultantly, in furtherance of our orders above, the Family Court, Jaipur is 
directed to:  
(i) 
Quantify the total arrears due to the Appellant in terms of the Impugned 
Order;   
(ii) 
Fixate the duration and the quantum of monthly payment to be made by 
the Respondent in furtherance of arrears of maintenance as computed 
in terms of  Paragraph 13(i) above, in such a manner that the total 
amount i.e., (a) regular maintenance to the extent of Rs.20,000/- 
(Rupees Twenty Thousand); and (b) the amount quantified towards the 
extinguishment of arrears of maintenance does not exceed 50% of the 
pension drawn by the Respondent from BSNL;  
(iii) Issue necessary directions to the BSNL to ensure that the total amount 
i.e., (a) regular maintenance to the extent of Rs.20,000/- (Rupees 
Twenty Thousand); and (b) the additional monthly payment as more 
particularly identified in 13(ii) above, is credited into the Appellants’ 
bank account on an identified date of every calendar month; and  
(iv) 
A copy of this Order may also be sent to BSNL for necessary 
compliance and onward action (if any).  
14. 
Further, it is made clear that the aforementioned quantification process 
would not interfere with our direction to the Respondent to pay the Appellant 
regular maintenance to the extent of Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) per 
month with effect from the date of the pronouncement of this Order.
