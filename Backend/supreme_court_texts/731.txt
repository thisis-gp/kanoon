1. The present appeal arises from the judgment and 
order of the High Court of Judicature at 
Allahabad dated 16.01.2013 in Writ (C) No. 
50320/2010 wherein the Respondent’s Writ 
Petition was allowed, orders dated 23.03.2010, 
11.06.2010 and 31.07.2010 passed by the 
Divisional Forest Officer, Renukoot, District

Respondent and to refund/adjust the amount 
paid by the Respondent for the year 2010-2011. 
2. The facts of the matter, succinctly put, are that 
the Respondent is a Government Company which 
was incorporated with an object to carry on 
mining operations for extraction of coal and 
supply thereof to core sector and non-core sector 
and is carrying on two coal mine projects namely 
‘Krishnashila Project’ and ‘Bina Project’ in the 
district of Sonebhadra. The DFO had issued 
letters dated 23.03.2010 and 11.06.2010 to the 
Respondent seeking the deposit of annual lease 
rent for the year 2010-2011 for the forest land 
which has been transferred on lease to the 
Respondent 
for 
30 
years 
and 
23 
years 
respectively. The Respondent deposited the said 
amount under protest which further led to the 
issuing of letter dated 31.07.2010 by the DFO 
stating that since the amount has been deposited 
under protest, which is against the conditions of 
transfer, the matter is being referred to the 
higher level of the Government for cancelling the 
said 
transfer. 
Thereafter, 
the 
Respondent 
preferred a Writ Petition before the High Court 

3 
 
challenging the above-mentioned letters and the 
demand of annual lease rent by the DFO. 
3. Before moving further, we find it relevant to delve 
into the genesis of vesting of such rights in the 
Respondent. 
On 
23.12.1980, 
the 
Central 
Government issued a notification under Section 
7 of the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and 
Development) Act, 19572 of its intention to 
acquire the lands admeasuring 1657.16 hectares 
(approximately) as specified in the Schedule, and 
consequently, 
issued 
a 
declaration 
on 
17.11.1981 acquiring the said land under 
Section 9 of CBA, 1957. The said declaration was 
published in the Gazette of India, dated 
05.12.1981, 
vesting 
the 
land 
and 
rights 
described in the Schedule appended to the 
abovementioned notification absolutely in the 
Central Government free from all encumbrances 
under Section 10(1) of the CBA, 1957. Further, 
in exercise of powers under S. 11(1) of CBA, 
1957, the Union Government, by its order dated 
02.11.1982, directed that the lands and rights so 
 
2 Hereinafter referred to as “CBA, 1957” 

4 
 
vested shall, w.e.f. from 05.12.1981, instead of 
continuing to so vest in the Central Government, 
shall vest in the Government Company named 
Central Coalfields Ltd. (which was later formed 
into Northern Coal Fields Ltd. w.e.f. 28.11.1985, 
i.e. the Respondent). 
4. Thereafter, the Respondent submitted a proposal 
for its ‘Krishnashila project’ of 235.99 hectares of 
land for obtaining approval of the Central 
Government for use of the land for mining 
purpose under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 
19803. Similarly, another proposal under the 
FCA, 1980 for usage of 258 hectares of forest 
land for mining purpose for ‘Bina Coal Project’ 
was submitted to the Central Government for 
obtaining its approval.  
5. Accordingly, in pursuance of Section 2 of the 
FCA, 1980, the Central Government, vide its 
order dated 23.05.1996, granted approval for 
diversion of 258 hectares of forest land under 
‘Bina Project’, which was communicated by the 
State Government to the Respondent vide letter 
 
3 Hereinafter referred to as “FCA, 1980” 

5 
 
dated 
28.06.1998. 
Similarly, 
the 
Central 
Government, with regard to the ‘Krishnashila 
Project’, vide its letter dated 06.07.2006, granted 
approval for diversion of 235.99 hectares of forest 
land in accordance with Section 2 of FCA, 1980, 
which was communicated to the Respondent by 
the 
State 
Government 
vide 
letter 
dated 
27.07.2007. 
6. The Respondent, by virtue of Section 18A of the 
CBA, 1957, has been paying money equal to 
royalty as determined under Section 9 of the 
Mines 
and 
Minerals 
(Development 
and 
Regulation) Act, 19574. However, the letter dated 
23.03.2010 
and 
subsequent 
letter 
dated 
11.06.2010 were issued to the Respondent 
demanding the deposit of “lease rent” amounting 
to 
Rs.1,24,23,015/- 
in 
accordance 
with 
Condition No. 7 of ‘Krishnashila Project’ and 
Rs.1,91,25,593/- in accordance with Condition 
No. 12 of ‘Bina Project’. 
7. Aggrieved by the said demand for “lease rent”, the 
Respondent preferred the Writ Petition before the 
 
4 “MMDR Act, 1957”, hereinafter 

6 
 
High Court, which was allowed while observing 
that the entire area has been acquired under 
CBA, 1957 under which the State has no 
legislative competence as held in State of West 
Bengal v. Union of India.5 Therefore, where the 
State is denuded of any power to legislate in the 
matter or to exercise any executive power under 
Article 
162 
of 
the 
Constitution 
and 
no 
satisfactory basis has been disclosed by the State 
Government for claiming the lease rent from the 
Respondent, Condition No. 7 in Government 
Order dated 27.07.2007 which is unsupported 
by any legal basis, cannot be permitted to operate 
against the Respondent. The State of UP, being 
aggrieved by the said judgment, is in appeal 
before us. 
8. Since the reasoning of the High Court is majorly 
based on the judgment in the case of State of 
West Bengal (supra), we find it imperative to deal 
with the said judgment first. In the said 
Constitution Bench judgment, wherein the 
statutory scheme of CBA, 1957 was discussed in 
 
5 AIR 1963 SC 1241 

7 
 
detail, the relevant question of law under 
consideration was whether the Parliament has 
legislative competence to enact a law for 
compulsory acquisition by the Union of land and 
other properties vested in or owned by the State. 
The said question was answered in the 
affirmative by the majority. It was held that the 
power to legislate for regulation and development 
of mines and minerals being under the control of 
the Union, would by necessary implication 
include the power to acquire mines and minerals, 
thereby upholding the constitutional validity of 
CBA, 1957, and in particular Sections 4 and 7. It 
must be noted that the said judgment only delved 
into the legislative competence of the Union and 
State in matters relating to acquisition of land, 
especially in context of mines and minerals, and 
did not deliberate upon the right of the State 
Government to claim lease rent by a Government 
Company under CBA, 1957 or other related acts. 
In the instant case, the legislative competence of 
neither the Union nor the State Government is 
under challenge. The matter at hand only 
pertains to the claim of lease rent by the State 

8 
 
Government and therefore, the rationale in 
judgment of State of West Bengal (supra) is of 
no avail to the Respondent. 
9. Another case that has been dealt with in the 
impugned judgment is a decision by the Division 
Bench of the Patna High Court in Managing 
Director, 
National 
Coal 
Development 
Corporation and etc. v. State of Bihar & Ors.6 
wherein a question arose as to whether the 
Petitioner-Company is liable to pay to the State 
of Bihar dead rent by reason of the provisions of 
Section 18A of CBA, 1957 or not. In the said case, 
the following was held – 
“7. In the State counter affidavit in 
C.W.J.C. 2462 of 1979, it has been stated 
that a relationship of lessor and lessee 
exists between the State Government and 
the petitioner-company. This stand does 
not appear to be correct. As has been 
pointed out, the present cases do not 
attract Section 10(2) of the Acquisition Act 
inasmuch as there were no mining leases. 
Admittedly, these cases relate to virgin 
mineral which continues to be unworked 
till now. The case is governed by Section 
10(1) and its language in no uncertain 
terms states that the entire interest of the 
 
6 AIR 1984 Pat 280 

9 
 
State vests absolutely in the Central 
Government free from all encumbrances. 
The State is completely divested of all its 
rights and a relationship of lessor and 
lessee does not continue between the State 
and the Central Government (or for that 
matter the petitioner-company). 
8. The next question is : does S. 18A of the 
Acquisition Act create a right in the State 
to realise Dead Rent? The language of 
Section 18A quoted above, while referring 
‘royalty’ has omitted to include ‘Dead Rent’ 
in the Section. ‘Royalty’ and ‘Dead Rent’ 
are two separate and distinct liabilities 
payable by lessees and have been dealt 
with separately by two Sections of the 
Development Act, that is, Sections 9 and 
9A. The rates are also detailed in the 
second and third schedules respectively. 
The rate of royalty is related to the quantity 
of coal to be extracted while Dead Rent is 
payable area-wise. Royalty is payable on 
the extracted mineral while Dead Rent on 
area having unworked mineral. The two 
expressions cannot be treated to refer to a 
common 
claim 
by 
the 
State. 
The 
distinction between the two has been 
appreciated and discussed in the decisions 
in Bhorulal v. State of Rajasthan (AIR 1956 
Raj 161), Sethi Marble Stone Industries v. 
State of Rajasthan (AIR 1958 Raj 140) and 
Surajdin Laxmanlal v. State of Madhya 
Pradesh (AIR 1960 MP 129). The view of 
the Certificate Officer that royalty includes 
Dead Rent is, therefore, clearly illegal. It 

10 
 
must, therefore, be held that Dead Rent is 
not payable by reason of Section 18A.” 
10. Insofar as the instant case at hand, we are only 
concerned with the observations pertaining to 
Section 10 of CBA, 1957 in the above judgment 
and not with the claim of dead rent under Section 
18A thereof. However, before going into the 
applicability/utility of the above judgment, we 
find it pertinent to produce the relevant 
provisions of CBA, 1957, which are as follows: 
“7. Power to acquire land or rights in or 
over land notified under Section 4.—(1) 
If the Central Government is satisfied that 
coal is obtainable in the whole or any part 
of the land notified under sub-section (1) 
of section 4, it may, within a period of two 
years from the date of the said notification 
or 
within 
such 
further 
period 
not 
exceeding one year in the aggregate as the 
Central Government may specify in this 
behalf, by notification in the Official 
Gazette, give notice of its intention to 
acquire the whole or any part of the land 
or of any rights in or over such land, as the 
case may be. 
(2) If no notice to acquire the land or any 
rights in or over such land is given under 
sub-section (1) within the period allowed 
thereunder, the notification issued under 
sub-section (1) of section 4 shall cease to 

11 
 
have effect on the expiration of three years 
from the date thereof.” 
 
9. Declaration of acquisition.—(1) When 
the Central Government is satisfied, after 
considering the report, if any, made under 
Section 8 that any land or any rights in or 
over such land should be acquired, a 
declaration shall be made by it to that 
effect [, and different declarations may be 
made from time to time in respect of 
different parcels of any land, or of rights in 
or over such land, covered by the same 
notification under sub-section (1) of 
Section 7, irrespective of whether one 
report or different reports has or have been 
made (wherever required) under sub-
section (2) of section 8]: 
[Provided that no declaration in respect of 
any particular land, or rights in or over 
such land, covered by a notification under 
sub-section (1) of section 7, issued after 
the commencement of the Coal Bearing 
Areas 
(Acquisition 
and 
Development) 
Amendment and Validation Act, 1971 (54 
of 1971), shall be made after the expiry of 
three years from the date of the said 
notification: 
Provided further that, where a declaration] 
relates to any land or to any rights in or 
over land belonging to a State Government 
which has or have not been leased out, no 
such declaration shall be made except 
after previous consultation with the State 
Government. 

12 
 
(2) [Every declaration] shall be published 
in the Official Gazette, and— 
(a) in any case where land is to be 
acquired, shall state the district or other 
territorial division in which the land is 
situate and its approximate area; and, 
where a plan shall have been made of the 
land, the place where such plan may be 
inspected; 
(b) in any case where rights in or over such 
land are to be acquired, shall state the 
nature and extent of the rights in addition 
to the matters relating to the land specified 
in clause (a); and 
a copy of every such declaration shall be 
sent to the State Government concerned. 
 
10. Vesting of land or rights in Central 
Government.— 
(1) On the publication in the Official 
Gazette of the declaration under section 9, 
the land or the rights in or over the land, 
as the case may be, shall vest absolutely 
in the Central Government [free from all 
encumbrances]. 
(2) Where the rights under any mining 
lease granted or deemed to have been 
granted by a State Government to any 
person are acquired under this Act, the 
Central Government shall, on and from the 
date of such vesting, be deemed to have 
become the lessee of the State Government 
as if a mining lease under the Mineral 
Concession Rules had been granted by the 
State 
Government 
to 
the 
Central 

13 
 
Government, the period thereof being the 
entire period for which such a lease could 
have 
been 
granted 
by 
the 
State 
Government under those rules. 
 
11. Power of Central Government to 
direct vesting of land or rights in a 
Government company.— 
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in 
section 10, the Central Government may, 
if it is satisfied that a Government 
company is willing to comply, or has 
complied, with such terms and conditions 
as the Central Government may think fit 
to impose, direct, by order in writing, that 
the land or the rights in or over the land, 
as the case may be, shall, instead of 
vesting in the Central Government under 
section 10 or continuing to so vest, vest in 
the Government company either on the 
date of publication of the declaration or on 
such other date as may be specified in the 
direction. 
(2) Where the rights under any mining 
lease acquired under this Act vest in a 
Government company under sub-section 
(1), the Government company shall, on 
and from the date of such vesting, be 
deemed to have become the lessee of the 
State Government as if a mining lease 
under the Mineral Concession Rules had 
been granted by the State Government to 
the Government company, the period 
thereof being the entire period for which 

14 
 
such a lease could have been granted by 
the State Government under those rules; 
and all the rights and liabilities of the 
Central Government in relation to the 
lease or the land covered by it shall, on and 
from the date of such vesting, be deemed 
to have become the rights and liabilities of 
the Government company.” 
11. A bare perusal of Section 10 and 11 clearly brings 
forth a plain distinction in the nature of right 
conferred and liabilities accrued between sub-
section (1) and (2) of Section 10, as also between 
sub-section (1) and (2) of Section 11. Further, 
Section 10(1) clearly provides that when the said 
provision is applied, the land or rights in or over 
the land shall vest absolutely in the Central 
Government free from all encumbrances. The 
words “free from all encumbrances” become of 
vital importance as it clarifies that from such 
point onwards, the Central Government becomes 
the absolute owner and has sole rights and claim 
over the land. However, when the State 
Government has already granted rights to any 
person under any mining lease and the Central 
Government subsequently acquires such land 
under Section 10(2), then the rights acquired by 

15 
 
the Central Government are limited to the 
capacity of a deemed lessee of the State 
Government. Therefore, the rights conferred 
under sub-section (2) of Section 10 are limited in 
nature as compared to sub-section (1) and such 
a 
distinction 
must 
be 
appreciated 
when 
determining the nature of acquisition by the 
Central Government. It must be noted that such 
a contrast in rights under Section 10(1) and (2) is 
rooted solely in the fact if the rights under any 
mining lease are granted to any person at the 
time of acquisition by the Central Government or 
not. The Central Government shall acquire the 
character of a deemed lessee of the State 
Government only if a mining lease granted by the 
State Government in favour of any person existed 
already before the Central Government acquired 
the land and rights over it. 
12. Similarly, Section 11 which talks about the 
power of Central Government to direct vesting of 
land or rights in a Government Company draws 
an identical distinction between its two sub-
sections. Section 11(1) specifically provides that, 
notwithstanding anything contained in Section 

16 
 
10, upon the satisfaction of the Central 
Government, the land or the rights in or over the 
land shall, instead of vesting in the Central 
Government under Section 10, vest in the 
Government Company from the specified date 
onwards. This means that sub-section (1) of 
Section 11 blanketly vests the land or rights in or 
over the land in the Government Company, as it 
vested in the Central Government, without any 
further stipulations. The nature of right that 
passes onto the Government Company shall be 
exactly identical to the right that existed with the 
Central 
Government 
itself. 
However, 
the 
language of sub-section (2) of Section 11 is direct 
and absolutely unclouded when it specifically 
talks about the situation “where any rights under 
any mining lease acquired under this Act vest in 
a Government company” and on the fulfilment of 
such 
pre-requisite 
alone, 
the 
Government 
Company shall become a deemed lessee of the 
State Government as if the State Government 
had granted a mining lease in the favour of that 
Government 
Company 
under 
the 
Mineral 
Concession Rules. This provision pre-supposes 

17 
 
the existence of a mining lease granted by the 
State 
Government 
prior 
to 
the 
Central 
Government acquiring it under the CBA, 1957. 
No relationship of a lessor and lessee shall come 
into existence between the State Government 
and the Government Company if there did not 
exist any mining lease under the Mineral 
Concession Rules, at the relevant point of time, 
when such right is being vested in the 
Government Company. Simply put, when there is 
no pre-existing lease at the time of acquisition by 
the Central Government and the rights are 
subsequently vested in a Government Company, 
then such Government Company does not 
become 
a 
deemed 
lessee 
of 
the 
State 
Government.  
13. Having 
clarified 
the 
legal 
position 
and 
interpretation of the two provisions, we now move 
to the factual analysis of our case. It is 
undisputed that by virtue of the notification in 
the Official Gazette dated 05.12.1981, the land 
and rights vested absolutely in the Central 
Government free from all encumbrances under 
Section 10(1) of the CBA,1957. This means that 

18 
 
the Central Government became the absolute 
owner of the land and rights over the land from 
05.12.1981 onwards. 
14. Further, 
the 
Government 
Order 
dated 
02.11.1982 published by the Government of 
India, which was produced as Annexure P-1 
before us, clearly provided that in exercise of the 
powers conferred by Section 11(1) of the CBA, 
1957, the Central Government had directed the 
vesting of such land and rights in the 
Government 
Company, 
with 
effect 
from 
05.12.1981. It is to be noted that the rights in the 
Government Company were vested specifically by 
virtue of sub-section (1) of Section 11 and at that 
time, there did not exist any mining lease as 
provided under sub-section (2). As explained 
above, the rights under Section 11(1) are vested 
in the Government Company in the exact nature 
as they existed in the Central Government at the 
time. Therefore, when the Central Government’s 
right was free from all encumbrances and 
completely absolute, the Government Company 
also acquired an absolute right over the land. No 
question of a qualified right in the capacity of a 

19 
 
deemed lessee of the State Government arises in 
such a situation. This is by virtue of the fact that 
when Central Government acquired such rights 
and also when it was further vested in the 
Government Company, there was no pre-existing 
mining lease in favour of any person and, 
therefore, Section 10(2) and Section 11(2) 
become inapplicable in the given case. Thus, the 
land vested in the Government Company free 
from all encumbrances, subject to the conditions 
imposed by the Central Government. Therefore, 
the State Government is not entitled to claim 
itself as a deemed lessor of the Government 
Company in the given situation and the demand 
for 
“lease 
rent” 
becomes 
completely 
unwarranted. 
15. The findings of the Patna High Court in 
Paragraph 7 of the judgment in the case of 
Managing 
Director, 
National 
Coal 
Development Corporation (supra) is in lines 
with our analysis as even in that case, it was held 
that Section 10(2) is not attracted because there 
existed no mining lease prior to acquisition. The 
situation therein was also governed by Section 

20 
 
10(1) and hence, it was rightly held that the State 
Government is divested of all its rights and a 
relationship of lessor and lessee does not 
continue between the State and the Central 
Government (or for that matter the petitioner-
company). 
16. There is another judgment of this Court in 
Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. v. State of Odisha7 
that was placed before us during the course of 
arguments. However, since in the said judgment, 
the dispute was with regards to the payment of 
premium and compensation, as opposed to the 
demand for “lease rent” in our case, the 
judgment, being distinguishable on facts, is not 
applicable to the case at hand. Moreover, in the 
said case, the right of the State Government to 
claim compensation/premium under section 18A 
of the CBA, 1957, was recognized by virtue of 
State Government being a “person interested” 
under Section 2(d) of the Act. Herein, there arises 
no question of an “interested person”. The said 
judgment did not delve into the question at hand 
 
7 (2023) 4 SCC 343 

21 
 
currently, that is the distinction between the 
nature of right acquired under Section 11(1) and 
(2), and there was no discussion whether there 
was a pre-existing mining lease at the time of 
acquisition or vesting of rights or not. Hence, the 
said judgment, is clearly distinguishable on 
facts. 
17. Lastly, 
we 
also 
observe 
that 
the 
State 
Government has raised multiple contentions that 
no prior consultation of the State Government 
was made for the transfer or acquisition of the 
reserved forest block in question under CBA, 
1957. The said contention is unfounded in view 
of notification dated 23.12.1980 under Section 7, 
declaration dated 17.11.1981 under Section 9, 
Gazette publication dated 05.12.1981 under 
Section 10 and Government Order dated 
02.11.1982 under Section 11 of the CBA, 1957 
which were never challenged by the State 
Government for any infirmity. Therefore, this 
contention is of no avail to the Appellant-State 
now. 
18. Having held that the State Government’s demand 
for “lease rent” was not supported by any 

22 
 
statutory provision, such a demand cannot be 
sustained in law. The appeal is accordingly 
dismissed, albeit for reasons different than the 
one provided by the High Court in the impugned 
judgment. 
19. There shall be no order as to costs.
