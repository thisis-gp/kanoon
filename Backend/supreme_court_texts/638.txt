JUDGMENT  
 
 
 
1. 
This civil appeal arises out of the decision of the 
National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission1 in First 
Appeal No. 248/2002 dated 16.07.2012. By the said order, the 
National Commission allowed the appeal filed by the respondent-
consumer by setting aside the order passed by the UT Consumer 
Disputes Redressal Commission, Chandigarh2 and directed payment 
of compensation quantified at Rs. 7,00,000/- by the appellant, 
with 12% interest from the date of the order till actual 
payment. Questioning the decision of the National Commission, 
the appellant is before us. The brief facts necessary for 
deciding the appeal are as follows: 
 
2. 
The respondent’s wife had been suffering from abdominal 
pain. She went through an ultrasonography test, which showed

stones in her gall bladder. The appellant is a doctor, who 
performed a surgery for removing the stones on 11.09.2000 on 
the basis of an ultrasonography. However, the patient developed 
various problems after the same, such as stomach ache, 
constipation and vomiting, etc. The patient re-consulted the 
appellant, who prescribed medications for pain and other 
symptoms. However, the patient’s problems continued to persist. 
Accordingly, on the suspicion of a “biliary leak”, a second 
ultrasonography test was conducted. The report of this test 
showed “more collection of fluid in the peritoneal cavity”. On 
04.10.2000, the appellant conducted another surgery to drain 
this fluid by what is known as “needle aspiration” from the 
“Pouch of Douglas”. 
 
2.1 However, the problems continued to persist, which is when 
the appellant referred the patient to a liver-specialist. On 
16.10.2000, the liver-specialist conducted an ECRP (Endoscopic 
Cholangio Pancreatography) test. Despite the test, the 
patient’s problems were found to continue. In fact, she was 
found to have developed ‘contracted pancreatitis’. Eventually, 
due to sepsis and multi-organ failure, the patient passed away 
on 04.11.2000. 
3. 
The respondent is the patient’s husband, who filed a 
consumer complaint before the UT Commission bearing number 
Complaint Case No. 6 of 2001. He claimed a sum of Rs. 8.30 

3 
 
 
lakhs as compensation for loss of his wife’s life due to the 
appellant’s medical negligence, which included sums claimed for 
mental agony and other costs.  
 
4. 
The appellant denied the submissions advanced by the 
respondent stating that there was no medical negligence on his 
part. It was argued that the appellant’s conduct in treating 
the patient was in accordance with the prevalent medical 
practices. His case was that he promptly tried to address the 
patient’s problem after the first surgery. All the problems 
were dealt with reasonable care, and that all the screening 
measures were conducted before any surgery. It was submitted 
that the appellant had performed multiple surgeries of similar 
nature in his career and his credentials as a competent doctor 
were proven by record. Lastly, he contended that removal of 
gall bladder had no relation with the patient’s death. 
 
5. 
The complaint was dismissed by the State Commission vide 
its order dated 27.03.2002. It was of the view that the 
respondent, as a complainant, had failed to discharge his onus. 
That is, it was not proved that a mistake on part of the 
appellant caused the death of the patient. It held that the 
respondent has not proved how established medical practices 
were deviated from. Mistakes, if any, were not proven to have 
a nexus with the patient’s death.

6. 
The respondent then approached the National Commission by 
way of an appeal. In view of the allegations about non-
compliance with standard medical practice, the National 
Commission had constituted a Medical Board composed of 
experienced doctors from the G.B. Pant Hospital, New Delhi and 
summoned a report on the matter. The said report concluded that 
the appellant had taken steps which were in accordance with the 
prevailing medical standards on the issue concerned. The 
conclusions of the Board are reproduced here for convenience: 
 
Sr. 
No. 
Query 
Opinion of Medical Board 
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
(i) 
Whether 
there 
was 
any 
medical negligence in the 
surgery of cholecystectomy 
performed by Dr. P.N. Gupta 
on 
the 
patient 
on 
11.09.2000? 
Bile duct injury is a well 
known 
complication 
in 
patients 
undergoing 
Laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy and occurs 
in approximately 0.5% of 
cases. This cannot be termed 
as medical negligence as 
some patients may have an 
unsuitable 
anatomy 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
past 
episodes of cholecystitis. 
(ii) 
Whether 
there 
was 
a 
possibility of occurrence 
of post-operative biliary 
leakage and, if so, what 
were 
the 
investigative 
methods available to the 
doctor to ascertain the 
incidence of leakage? 
This point is covered vide 
supra. 
Bile 
duct 
injury 
results 
in 
biliary 
peritonitis 
or 
biloma 
formation; 
the 
standard 
investigation 
to 
detect 
this is by doing an leakage? 
USG/CT examination. 
(iii) Whether the patient having 
undergone cholecystectomy 
on 11.09.2000 could have 
Biliary ascites is usually 
not 
an 
acute 
event. 
Gradually over a period of 

5 
 
 
developed severe biliary 
leakage (leading to Biliary 
Peritonitis) suddenly on 
one date, viz., 30.09.2000? 
time the fluid goes on 
accumulating. 
When 
this 
reaches a significant level 
the patient becomes aware of 
abdominal 
distension 
or 
pain. 
(iv) 
Whether the management and 
surgical intervention by 
Dr. 
P.N. 
Gupta 
on 
30.09.2000 and 03.10.2000 
and upto his referral of 
the patient to the PGIMER 
on 13.10.2000 was according 
to the standard medical 
protocol? 
The 
management 
of 
post-
operative bile leak between 
30.09.2000 
to 
03.10.2000 
was as per standard protocol 
as he inserted a tube drain 
and 
then 
referred 
the 
patient 
for 
ERCP 
examination 
to 
Dr. 
N. 
Nagpal. 
(v) 
Whether there was any delay 
and/ or any deficiency in 
providing medical service 
in 
that 
behalf, 
particularly in respect of 
the points at (ii) and 
(iv)? 
In retrospect some of the 
investigations 
if 
done 
earlier could have detected 
the 
injury 
/bile 
collection; however, from 
the notes it appears that on 
clinical examination of the 
patient at the time, Dr. 
Gupta in his wisdom did not 
feel 
that 
further 
investigations 
were 
warranted and, therefore, 
prescribed medication for 
symptomatic 
relief. 
This 
would 
be 
medically 
acceptable. 
In 
hindsight 
this may be construed as an 
error of judgment on the 
part of the clinician but 
cannot 
be 
equated 
with 
medical negligence. 
 
7. 
 After considering the report in detail, the National 
Commission found it to be cryptic and that it did not answer 
the issue convincingly. It is in this context that the National 
Commission undertook the burden to examine the matter in detail. 

6 
 
 
It is pertinent to note that the National Commission was aware 
of the limitation in re-examining the report, and proceeded 
within the permissible legal limits to do the same. Learned 
counsels for the parties produced detailed material. Both 
parties filed medical literature to establish what the 
normative standard in such cases ought to be. We don’t find it 
necessary to reproduce the entire literature referred and 
analyzed by the Commission. It is sufficient to consider what 
literature that was cited by the parties. 
 
7.1 The respondent had produced SLEISENGER AND FORDTRAN'S 
GASTROINTESTINAL AND LIVER DISEASE, (Editors Mark Feldman, 
Lawrence S. Friedman and Marvin H. Sleisenger, 7th Edition) in 
support of his contention. On the other hand the appellant 
produced (a) BAILEY & LOVE'S SHORT PRACTICE OF SURGERY (21st 
Edition); (b) Z. Rayter, C. Tonge, C.E. Bennett, P.S. Robinson, 
and M.H. Thomas, Bile leaks after simple cholecystectomy,

19-22; and (e) Michael J. Zinner, Seymour I Schwartz, Harold 
Ellis, VOLUME II MAINGOT'S ABDOMINAL OPERATIONS (10TH edition). 
In addition to the literature supplied by the parties, the 
National Commission deemed it fit to consider (a) TEXT BOOK OF 
GASTROENTEROLOGY (VOLUME 2), (Edited by Tadataka Yamada, 5th 
edition, Published by Wiley Black) and (b) BAILEY AND LOVE'S 
SHORT PRACTICE OF SURGERY, (Edited by Norman S. Williams, 
Christopher J. K. Bulstrode & P. Ronan O'Connell, 25th edition). 
 
8. 
After a detailed scrutiny of the literature, the National 
Commission summarised the position as under: 
“a. Anatomically, the biliary tree consists of the 
left and right hepatic ducts joining to form the 
common 
hepatic 
duct, 
cystic 
duct 
from 
the 
gallbladder joining the common hepatic duct to 
form the common bile duct (CBD) and CBD and the 
pancreatic duct joining together at the ampulla of 
Vater in the D2 (second) part of the duodenum.  
b. 
With 
laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy 
widely 
replacing open cholecystectomy, the incidence of 
post-operative bile leakage due to iatrogenic (any 
adverse condition in a patient resulting from 
treatment by a physician or surgeon) injuries to 
the common bile duct or any of the preceding 
biliary ducts has increased more than two-fold. 
However, 
even 
then, 
it 
remains 
a 
"known 
complication" with a low probability/incidence 
(0.3% - 2.7%, i.e., 3-27 in 1000 cases of LC and 
0.25% - 0.5%, i.e., 2.5-5 in 1000 cases of OC). 
Bile leakage due to slipping of the ligature of or 
injuries to the cystic duct is also a known 
complication. Cystic stump leaks can occur from 
faulty clip application, slipping of the clips or 
necrosis of the cystic duct stump proximal to the 
clip, probably related to diathermy injury.  
c. 'When the anatomy of the triangle of Calot is 
unclear, blind dissection should stop.' The 
'triangle of Calot' is the triangular anatomical 

8 
 
 
space bounded by the cystic duct - inferiorly, 
cystic artery - superiorly and the common hepatic 
duct - medially). 'Dissection in the triangle of 
Calot 
is 
ill-advised 
until 
the 
lateralmost 
structures have been cleared and identification of 
the cystic duct is definitive. According to SESAP 
12 (produced and distributed by the American 
College of Surgeons) dissection in the triangle of 
Calot is the #1 cause of common bile duct injuries' 
(vide 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystohepatic_triangl
e). 
d. A major risk factor for bile duct injury is the 
experience of the surgeon. Bile duct injuries 
appear to be much more common early in a surgeon's 
experience with the technique. Other risk factors 
appear to be the presence of aberrant biliary tree 
anatomy and the presence of local acute or chronic 
inflammation.  
e. 'In 85% of cases, the injury declares itself 
post-operatively by: (1) a profuse and persistent 
leakage of bile if drainage has been provided, or 
bile peritonitis if such drainage has not been 
provided; and (2) deepening obstructive jaundice. 
When the obstruction is incomplete, jaundice is 
delayed until subsequent fibrosis renders the 
lumen of the duct inadequate.'  
f. 'Careful history-taking, clinical examination 
and investigations point to the cause of jaundice. 
Serum biochemistry confirms the diagnosis of 
jaundice 
with 
an 
elevated 
serum 
bilirubin, 
usually > 40 µmol/1 when detectable clinically. An 
obstructive pattern is recognizable in the other 
liver function tests, i.e., a high alkaline 
phosphatase 
and 
only 
mild 
increase 
in 
the 
concentration of transaminases.' 
g. For patients 'who have anything less than a 
smooth postoperative course', diagnostic imaging 
is warranted 'even in the absence of pain, fever, 
leukocytosis, or abdominal tenderness.'  
h. 'It is unnecessary and undesirable to perform 
an exploratory laparotomy solely to diagnose or 
drain an abdominal bile collection. Percutaneous 
drainage can be as thorough, and it avoids the 
morbidity of a laparotomy.'  
i. After drainage of bile collection but before 
starting any definitive line of treatment, ERCP 
(or, MRCP) is the procedure of widest choice to 
determine the source of the bile leakage and/ or 
the existence of stone and/or stricture in the 
biliary tree anatomy. The former has the added 
advantage 
of 
therapeutic 
use 
in 
certain 

9 
 
 
situation.” 
 
9. 
It is in the above referred context that the National Commission 
re-examined the report and came to the conclusion that the 
appellant’s conduct was, in fact, negligent. In conclusion, the 
National Commission’s findings may be summarized as follows; 
i. 
During the patient’s gallbladder surgery, the appellant 
switched from a minimally invasive method to an open 
surgery but he could not identify the relevant artery 
and the ducts. Despite this limitation, he went ahead 
with the procedure. 
ii. 
The appellant failed to issue a proper discharge summary. 
iii. 
The doctor disregarded the repeated complaints of 
stomach pain until the patient developed noticeable 
jaundice. He himself admitted that the patient had been 
suffering pain around that time and he was continually 
aware of the same. 
iv. 
The appellant failed to take proper consent for the 
surgeries. 
v. 
On 04.10.2000, the appellant simply tried to drain the 
bile leak, but made no efforts to identify its cause. 
His own handwritten notes and his referral to another 
doctor demonstrate this. 
vi. 
The appellant delayed referring the patient to the liver-
specialist by 8 days after the second surgery. Whereas, 

10 
 
 
medical standards required him to refer her to the ERCP 
procedure more promptly, especially when he was aware he 
could not have carried it out himself. 
vii. 
Compounding all the above acts of negligence, the 
appellant had attempted to write the records of the case 
which differed with entries made in medical records. 
viii. 
The appellant had pleaded guilty for the delay in 
referral to the liver-specialist, but had attempted to 
disguise the same with legalese. 
 
10. For arriving at its conclusions, the National Commission 
applied the principles laid down by this Court in Jacob Mathew 
v State of Punjab3 to follow the standard of medical negligence 
while examining the facts before it. It also considered the 
decision in Samira Kohli v Dr. Prabha Manchanda & Another4 to 
analyse when a patient can be said to have given valid consent. The 
conclusions of the National Commission are to the follows: 
“19. In conclusion, we are of the view that the 
respondent has to be held guilty of medical 
negligence/ deficiency in service at least on four 
counts. The respondent did not pay any attention 
to the patient's persistent complaints of pain (as 
he himself admitted in his referral note for ERCP) 
till she presented with visible signs of jaundice 
and thus unduly delayed the diagnostic tests that 
were taken only on 02.10.2000. Secondly, having 
conducted 
an 
"exploratory" 
laparotomy 
on 
04.10.2000, he failed to even attempt locating the 
cause of the bile leakage suffered by the patient 
though all standard literature (including that 
 
3(2005) 6 SCC 1. 
4(2008) 2 SCC 11. 

11 
 
 
cited by the respondent) pointed to cystic duct 
stump leak as one of the most frequent causes of 
such leakage - such a situation was particularly 
likely in this case because the cholecystectomy 
was proceeded with by the respondent despite his 
inability to clearly separate the cystic duct and 
the cystic artery before their dissection, and 
ligature. 
Further, 
after 
conducting 
the 
laparotomy, he delayed referring the patient for 
ERCP for no rhyme or reason though all standard 
literature (and hence the corpus of knowledge and 
practice based thereon expected of an ordinary 
medical practitioner of the relevant specialty) 
mandated such an investigation at the earliest 
because that is the most widely recommended way of 
both diagnosing and, in some situations also 
treating, 
bile 
anatomy 
injury/ 
obstruction 
evidenced by either stricture/obstruction in the 
biliary tree or fistular leakage of bile flow. The 
respondent himself knew of this, according to his 
repeated admissions. It is really strange that 
this failure could be pleaded as an error of 
judgment. A physician can commit an error of 
judgment in a case of more than one options of 
(or, approaches to) diagnosis and/or treatment of 
a patient's condition and he honestly believing 
one of them to be more appropriate than the other/s 
for that patient, though in retrospect that may 
tum out to be not so appropriate or advantageous 
to the patient. Here, in this case, the respondent 
knew full well that the patient must undergo ERCP 
(or, an equivalent diagnostic or diagnostic- cum-
therapeutic 
procedure), 
which 
he 
was 
not 
professionally competent to conduct. Why he 
delayed 
this 
reference 
to 
a 
qualified 
gastroenterologist/ endoscopist, or, in this case 
to the PGI, when he had not even been able to 
identify the patient's biliary anatomy injury, 
leave alone repair it, may be a 'judgment' of sorts 
of this particular surgeon but certainly not an 
error of judgment that an average informed and 
careful surgeon would make. Finally, there is 
incontrovertible evidence in the form of the 
signed consent documents that the respondent did 
not discharge the duty of disclosure in case of 
either surgery (cholecystecto1ny or laparotomy) as 
required of him under the law governing consent. 
We cannot also overlook the fact that this 
respondent's recording of important treatment 
records could be interpreted to suggest an attempt 
at "improving" his case but perhaps that was not 
deliberate. It is unfortunate that the medical 

12 
 
 
board did not go into these questions with the 
seriousness expected of an independent body of 
experts. However, there is no evidence at all that 
the acts of the respondent /OP were the proximate 
cause 
of 
Reeta's 
eventual 
death 
and 
the 
respondent/OP cannot be held to account for that.” 
 
 
11. In view of these findings, the National Commission 
proceeded to pass the following Order: 
 ”21. …the appeal is partly allowed and the 
order of the State Commission is set aside. The 
respondent 
is 
directed 
to 
pay 
to 
the 
appellant/complainant the sum of Rs.7 lakh as 
consolidated compensation, including cost, 
within four weeks from the date of this order, 
failing which the sum would be liable to be 
paid with interest @ 12% per annum from the 
date of this order till realisation.” 
 
 
12. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties. Mr. T. 
Mahipal, counsel for the appellant, submitted that the National 
Commission could not have substituted the opinion of medical 
experts with its own. In any case, the patient was given 
reasonable 
care. 
This 
is 
demonstrated 
by 
multiple 
ultrasonography tests, an x-ray test, medical prescriptions, 
post-operative care and a second surgery without any charges. 
Furthermore, the cause of death in the patient’s report was 
nowhere linked with the acts of the appellant. It was also 
stated that throughout the proceedings before the State and the 
National Commissions, the credentials about the appellant’s 
competence were never disproved. 
 

13 
 
 
12.1 Mr. Ravi Kant Sharma, counsel appearing for the respondent, 
on the other hand, submitted that the patient made repeated 
complaints about subsisting pain in her abdominal area. More 
specifically, after her discharge on 12.09.2000, she visited 
the appellant on 20.09.2000, 25.09.2000 and 30.09.2000. 
However, no diagnosis was conducted by the appellant until the 
patient visibly developed jaundice. Despite the second 
ultrasonography report disclosing bile fluid, the cause was not 
looked into. The delay in referral to the liver-specialist 
compounded the patient’s problems, and hence, her death has a 
direct nexus with the appellant’s acts/omissions. 
 
13. Having considered the matter in detail, we are of the 
opinion that the National Commission has not committed any 
error in reaching its conclusions. The judgment of the National 
Commission 
is 
well-reasoned, 
and 
depicts 
a 
detailed 
consideration of all the relevant material, including the 
opinion of the doctors who have been examined before it.  
 
14. The parties had filed two different sets of medical 
records. The medical records filed by the appellant did not 
contain a detailed record of the surgical process, nor did they 
contain the standard notings on the closure of wounds. More 
significantly, the records filed by the appellant did not cite 
whether the patient’s gall bladder contained any stones, for 

14 
 
 
which the surgery was performed to begin with. The National 
Commission correctly noted that the results of the first 
ultrasonography in the records filed by the appellant were 
similarly doubtful. While the report showed the presence of 
bile in several regions of the patient’s body, the record 
described the presence to be ‘minimal’.  
 
15. Furthermore, the appellant failed to supply the results of 
the second ultrasonography, on the basis of which the second 
surgery to drain the fluid was conducted. Crucially, nothing 
was brought to the Commission’s notice which demonstrated that 
the patient had properly consented to the second surgery.  Apart 
from the medical records filed by the parties, the National 
Commission had considered the relevant medical literature on 
the subject and whether the appellant’s conduct was in 
consonance 
with 
standard 
medical 
practice. 
As 
stated 
previously, the National Commission also considered the report 
of the Medical Board and concluded that the Board has not 
examined the medical records carefully. 
 
16. Coming to the submissions of the parties, the National 
Commission found the appellant’s submissions to be unreliable. 
It is seen that the appellant’s submissions contradicted the 
liver specialist’s submissions, insofar as the date of post-
operative visits was concerned. Another contradiction was that 

15 
 
 
while the appellant denied the patient’s visit on 28.09.2000 
before the State Commission, his records showed an entry in the 
patient’s name for the same date. Significantly, the patient 
complained to the appellant about stomach pain and constipation 
on 25.09.2000 and 28.09.2000. However, instead of investigating 
if a serious problem existed with the patient, the appellant 
merely gave out prescriptions of medicines to deal with the 
patient’s symptoms. More importantly, the appellant did not 
offer any convincing reasons for delaying the referral to a 
liver-specialist, despite being aware of the medical condition.  
 
17. Considering all the above material, the finding of the 
National Commission that the appellant’s conduct did not meet 
the required standard of ‘reasonable care’ and that he was 
negligent cannot be interfered with. The National Commission 
considered the relevant material before itself, and correctly 
relied on this Court’s decision in Jacob Mathew (supra) to 
conclude that medical negligence was proved in the facts of the 
case.  
 
18. In light of the above, we uphold the order passed by the 
National Commission in First Appeal No. 248 of 2002 dated 
16.07.2012 and dismiss Civil Appeal No. 7262 of 2012. However, 
in the facts and circumstances of the case, we deem it 
appropriate to modify the direction of the National Commission 

16 
 
 
with respect to payment of interest from @ 12% to 6% per annum. 
 
19. The Civil Appeal is disposed of in terms of the above 
directions. 
 
20. There shall be no order as to costs.
