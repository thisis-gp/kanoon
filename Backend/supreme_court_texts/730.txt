4. 
The prosecution case is as follows: 
(i)

(ii) 
Brij Bihari Prasad was also accompanied by his bodyguard – 
Lakshmeshwar Sahu, who was armed with a carbine, and other 
sepoys.  
(iii) 
Two vehicles, a Sumo car, with registration number, BR-1P-1818, 
followed by an Ambassador car, registration number of which 
could not be ascertained, entered the IGIMS hospital from the 
southern main gate, Bailey Road side and stopped near Brij Bihari 
Prasad.  
(iv) 
Occupants of the said cars, namely – Mantu Tiwari (A-4), Vijay 
Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Rajan Tiwari (A-9), and 
Shri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash Shukla (since deceased), 
Satish Pandey (since deceased) and Bhupendra Nath Dubey 
(since deceased) came out of the vehicles.  
(v) 
Mantu Tiwari(A-4) was armed with a sten gun and all others were 
armed with pistols. Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) 
abusively exhorted others to shoot at Brij Bihari Prasad while he 
himself also fired at Brij Bihari Prasad with his pistol.  
(vi) 
Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Shri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash 
Shukla (since deceased) fired at Brij Bihari Prasad from their sten 
gun and pistol respectively. 
(vii) 
Satish Pandey, Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) and 
Rajan Tiwari (A-9) fired at Lakshmeshwar Sahu.  
(viii) Both Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu collapsed and 
died.

(ix) 
Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14) suffered a gunshot wound in the cross-
fire. 
 
5. 
The post-mortem reports dated 14.06.1998 (Exhibits 9 & 9/1), proved by 
Dr. Arvind Kumar Singh (PW-7), establish the homicidal death of Brij 
Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu due to multiple gunshot injuries 
resulting in haemorrhage and shock. The multiple gunshot wound entries 
are consistent with successive firing from firearms/pistol. To this extent 
the prosecution version is unchallenged. 
 
 
6. 
As per the prosecution case, there were eleven eye-witnesses, namely, 
Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), 
Amod Kumar (PW-11), Ram Nandan Singh (PW-12), Arbind Singh (PW-
13), Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14), Kamakhya Narain Singh (PW-15), Bhola 
Prasad Premi (PW-16), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Shashi 
Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and Binod Kumar Singh (PW-19). However, 
Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Shashi 
Bhushan Singh (PW-42), and to some extent, Amarendra Kumar Sinha 
(PW-10) had supported the prosecution case. Others were hostile or 
partly hostile as they did not support the prosecution case or did not 
name/identify the perpetrators. 
 
7. 
Primarily relying on the testimonies of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), 
Mahant Ashwani Das (PW-25), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and

Reasoning of the High Court 
 
8. 
The judgment of the High Court refers to the evidence in detail, with the 
acquittal of the respondents grounded in the following findings:  
(i) 
FIR No. 336/1998, marked Exhibit 51, is ante-timed. 
(ii) 
Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) is not an eye-witness, but rather 
a planted witness, as his name was not mentioned in the 
fardbeyan (Exhibit 50).  His antecedents are questionable. 
(iii) 
The testimony of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) implicating the 
respondents-accused is unreliable because: 
(a) he is Brij Bihari Prasad’s brother-in-law; 
(b) he should have been the informant but was not, which raises 
doubts about his presence at the IGIMS hospital; 
(c) he contradicted the prosecution’s case by accepting that Rajan 
Tiwari (A-9), whom he knew beforehand, was not present 
during the incident. However, in his statement under Section 
161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 197310, he claimed that 
 
8 It is an accepted and admitted position that Captain Sunil Singh (A-5) has passed away. The appeal 
qua him shall stand abated.  
9 The appeal qua Shashi Kumari Rai (A-7) stood abated on account of his demise vide order dated 
28.02.2020. 
10 For short, “CrPC”. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 6 of 40 
 
Rajan Tiwari (A-9) was one of the assailants of Lakshmeshwar 
Sahu; and 
(d) he deposed under the pressure of his sister, Rama Devi (PW-
24), who was present in the court during the recording of his 
evidence on all (three) days.  
(iv) 
The deposition of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) is unreliable on 
the following grounds: 
(a) he is a convict in a murder case registered in the year 1979; 
(b) he did not surrender after the dismissal of his appeal by the 
High Court and was accordingly declared an absconder; 
(c) he was arrested on 04.05.2006 while deposing before the trial 
court in the present case; 
(d) he was under the patronage and protection of Brij Bihari Prasad 
and his wife, Rama Devi (PW-24); 
(e) there is a contradiction between the versions of Shashi 
Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) 
regarding their presence in the hospital room of Brij Bihari 
Prasad at IGIMS hospital. While Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-
42) claims that Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) was in the 
hospital room when he arrived there, Mahanth Ashwani Das 
(PW-25) states that Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) was 
already present in the hospital room of Brij Bihari Prasad when 
he (Mahanth Ashwani Das) reached the hospital. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 7 of 40 
 
(f) there is a discrepancy as to when the police recorded the 
statement of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) and his version of 
events on 13.06.1998 and 14.06.1998. Mahanth Ashwani Das 
(PW-25) claims that after the occurrence he and Rama Devi 
(PW-24) had proceeded to the official residence of Brij Bihari 
Prasad from IGIMS hospital at about 9:00-9:30 p.m. Mahanth 
Ashwani Das (PW-25) had left for Muzzaffarpur Math in the 
night at about 12:30 a.m. on 14.06.1998. Thus, the police could 
not have recorded the statement of Mahanth Ashwani Das 
(PW-25) in the IGIMS hospital at 12:30 a.m. on 14.06.1998. 
Further, if Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) was present at the 
time of occurrence, as deposed by him, police should have 
recorded his statement before he left the IGIMS hospital 
campus around 9:30 p.m.  
(v) 
Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) was not an eye-witness, as his 
presence is not mentioned in the fardbeyan (Exhibit 50) or the FIR 
(Exhibits 51 and 51/1). His statement under Section 161 of the 
CrPC was recorded belatedly, five days after the incident. 
(vi) 
Rama Devi (PW-24) is not an eye-witness, as she had left the 
place of occurrence prior to the incident. The police did not 
produce Rama Devi’s statement under Section 161 of the CrPC 
recorded on 13.06.1998 by the second investigating officer11 – 
Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54), who had taken charge of the 
 
11 For short, “IO”. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 8 of 40 
 
investigation in compliance with the instructions of Senior 
Superintendent of Police, Patna.  The version of Rama Devi (PW-
24) that she learnt names and details of the assailants from the 
visitors she had met earlier in the day in the hospital room is not 
mentioned in the Section 161 CrPC statements dated 18.10.1999 
and 28.03.2001 given by her to Rai Singh Khatri (PW-62), IO of 
CBI. This is corroborated by the statement of Rai Singh Khatri 
(PW-62), IO of CBI, who testified that Rama Devi (PW-24) did not 
name the assailants. Since the initial statement of Rama Devi 
(PW-24) under Section 161 CrPC recorded by Shashi Bhushan 
Sharma (PW-54) was not on record and she later failed to disclose 
the name of the assailants in her Section 161 CrPC statements to 
Rai Singh Khatri (PW-62), IO of CBI, her deposition in court, 
stating that Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Ram Niranjan 
Chaudhary (A-6), Kamakhya Narain Singh (PW-15), Arbind Singh 
(PW-13), Amarendra Kumar Sinha (Informant/PW-10), Onkar 
Singh, Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Shashi Bhushan Singh 
(PW-42) and others were present with the deceased, should not 
be relied on. 
(vii) 
The eye-witnesses did not testify about the retaliatory firing by the 
security personnel of Brij Bihari Prasad who were present at the 
scene of the occurrence. The recovery of empty cartridges and the 
firearms examination report (Exhibit-17) indicate that shots were 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 9 of 40 
 
fired from two of the four rifles which had been issued to the 
security guards. 
 
Court depositions and analysis of evidence 
 
9. 
We will now examine in some detail the court depositions of Paras Nath 
Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Amarendra Kumar 
Singh (PW-10) and Rama Devi (PW-24), before scrutinising the reasons 
given by the High Court to discredit their versions. Our discussion will 
also address the arguments raised by both sides, with particular focus 
on the contention of the respondents that the court depositions of Paras 
Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Amarendra 
Kumar Singh (PW-10) and Rama Devi (PW-24) should not be accepted. 
 
10. 
At the outset, we express our agreement with the reasoning given by the 
High Court for disbelieving the presence of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-
42) at the spot, and consequently, his deposition as an eye-witness for 
the following reasons: 
(i) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) is not mentioned as one of the 
persons present at the place of occurrence in the fardbeyan 
(Exhibit-50), as also in the FIR (Exhibits 51 and 51/1). These 
documents name the eyewitnesses. Therefore, the absence of the 
name of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) is significant. 
(ii) His statement under Section 161 CrPC was recorded on 
18.06.1998, i.e., 5 days after the date of occurrence; 
(iii) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) has deposed about taking the dead 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 10 of 40 
 
body of Brij Bihari Prasad on 14.06.1998 from Patna to Behihari 
village, the native place of Brij Bihari Prasad. Therefore, the delay 
in his Section 161 CrPC statement impairs his assertion of being an 
eyewitness, making it unworthy of acceptance; 
(iv) Although Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahant Ashwani Das 
(PW-25), and Rama Devi (PW-24) have testified to the presence of 
Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) as an eyewitness, this assertion 
should not be accepted. The fardbeyan (Exhibit P-50), being the first 
written account made immediately after the incident, is 
unexceptionable. Furthermore, the unexplained delay of five days 
in recording the statement of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) as an 
eyewitness dents the credibility of his account. 
(v) For the same reasons, the reliance of the prosecution on the court 
testimony of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), averring the 
presence of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) at the place of 
occurrence, contrary to his fardbeyan, is erratic and untrustworthy. 
Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), did not entirely support the 
prosecution case, yet being conscious of the fact that he was the 
informant of the fardbeyan, he could not completely resile. His dock 
version about the presence of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) has 
been rightly disbelieved. 
 
Testimony of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) 
 
11. 
Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) is categoric about his presence in the 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 11 of 40 
 
hospital at about 6:40–7:00 p.m. on 13.06.1998 to visit Brij Bihari Prasad. 
He named the persons who were present with him in the hospital room, 
which includes Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25). The testimony captures 
the following: 
 
(i) 
Brij Bihari Prasad went for a walk along with the people of his 
constituency and supporters who had come to see him. The police 
personnel assigned for his protection also accompanied him. 
(ii) After some time, two vehicles – a white Sumo car (Registration No. 
BR-1P-1818) and a white Ambassador car – came into the hospital 
and stopped at a distance of about 20 steps in front of Brij Bihari 
Prasad. 
(iii) Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) alighted from the Sumo 
car, which was also carrying 2-3 more persons. 2-3 other people 
also alighted from the Ambassador car. 
(iv) Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) pointed towards Brij 
Bihari Prasad and ordered that he be killed, while he himself also 
started firing shots. Others joined him in the firing. 
(v) Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) specifically identified Satish Pandey 
(since deceased) as an occupant of the Ambassador car. 
(vi) Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), who was a legislator 
from Lal Ganj, got down from the Ambassador car, while Mantu 
Tiwari (A-4), along with 1-2 more people, alighted from the Sumo. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 12 of 40 
 
(vii) Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) saw Mantu Tiwari (A-4) but did not 
know his name. He came to know about the name subsequently 
from Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) and Shashi Bhushan Singh 
(PW-42). 
(viii) Mantu Tiwari (A-4) was carrying a big firearm while Bhupendra Nath 
Dubey (since deceased) was carrying a small firearm. The other 
assailants were carrying either a revolver or a small firearm. 
(ix) Bodyguard Lakshmeshwar Sahu who was carrying a carbine, was 
also fired upon.  
(x) As a result of the firing, both Lakshmeshwar Sahu and Brij Bihari 
Prasad collapsed. 
(xi) While leaving, Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) took the 
carbine that belonged to Lakshmeshwar Sahu and raised the slogan 
“Jai Bajrang Bali”. 
(xii) After the assailants left, Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and other 
visitors went near the dead bodies of Brij Bihari Prasad and 
Lakshmeshwar Sahu. 
(xiii) Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) identified both Mantu Tiwari (A-4) 
and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) in the court. 
(xiv) While Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) identified Rajan Tiwari (A-9) 
in the court, he testified that Rajan Tiwari (A-9) was not present at 
the place of occurrence. Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) had not 
seen Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) and Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7) at the 
place of occurrence. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 13 of 40 
 
(xv) Paras Nath Chaudhary (PW-1) establishes the presence of 
Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi 
Bhushan Singh (PW-42), Ram Nandan Singh (PW-12), Mahanth 
Ashwani Das (PW-25), Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14), one Kanti, 
resident of Jamui, Kamakhya Narain Singh (PW-15), Ram Niranjan 
Chaudhary (A-6), Vijay Jha (PW-51) and 2-3 other persons at the 
IGIMS hospital. 
 
12. 
The cross-examination of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) brings the 
following aspects to light:  
(i) 
He accepted that Rama Devi (PW-24) was his sister and that she 
was present in the court on the day of the hearing but left while his 
evidence was being recorded.  
(ii) 
He affirmed that Brij Bihari Prasad was admitted to the hospital 10-
12 days before the occurrence.  
(iii) 
Before the date of occurrence, he met Brij Bihari Prasad in the 
hospital on 4-5 occasions. 
(iv) 
Brij Bihari Prasad, being in judicial custody, was admitted to IGIMS 
hospital by the jail administration.  
(v) 
He accepted that his sister, Rama Devi (PW-24), had contested 
Lok Sabha elections in the past. Rama Devi (PW-24) contested 
Vidhan Sabha elections after the death of Brij Bihari Prasad.  
(vi) 
He states that he had also taken part in the election campaign of 
Rama Devi (PW-24).  

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 14 of 40 
 
(vii) 
He denied knowing the fact that Devendra Nath Dubey, one of the 
candidates of Motihari constituency, was the main rival of Rama 
Devi (PW-24).  
(viii) He further denied that Brij Bihari Prasad along with his brother, 
Shyam Bihari Prasad, murdered Devendra Nath Dubey.  
(ix) 
He affirmed his presence at the place of occurrence and denied 
the claim that he did not witness the incident. 
(x) 
He refuted the suggestion that being the brother-in-law of Brij 
Bihari Prasad, he is giving false evidence.  
(xi) 
He also denied the claim that he was deposing at the behest of his 
sister Rama Devi (PW-24).  
(xii) 
He reiterates that Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) and others were 
present at the hospital.  
(xiii) Two guards, which included Lakshmeshwar Sahu, were walking 
beside Brij Bihari Prasad.  
(xiv) After the firing, the hospital staff and other people present started 
running in different directions.  
(xv) 
Rama Devi (PW-24) came to the hospital after the incident. He 
testifies to seeing her cry beside the dead body of Brij Bihari 
Prasad.  
(xvi) Police officers examined the dead body of Brij Bihari Prasad and 
prepared an Inquest Report. He denies signing the Inquest Report 
or any other document. 
(xvii) He had gone to the hospital the next morning on 14.06.1998.  

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 15 of 40 
 
(xviii) He mentioned that his police statement was recorded about 10-12 
hours12 after the incident but could not recall the exact date since 
it was taken seven years ago. 
 
13. 
Though it was pointed out that Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), in his 
testimony, could not remember the number of the hospital room or 
whether it was south-facing or not, this aspect would not, in our opinion, 
dent his core testimony. It is apposite to note that Paras Nath Chaudhury 
(PW-1) was aware that the hospital room was on the ground floor and 
there was a verandah after crossing 4-5 rooms on the west side. He 
further stated that there was a cycle stand, a vacant place for sitting, and 
a road which joins Bailey Road on the west side. 
 
14. 
Paras Nath Chaudhury13 (PW-1) accepts that he did not seek prior 
permission from the court or the jail authorities to visit Brij Bihari Prasad 
in the hospital, nor did he make any entry into the hospital register. This 
is also true for other visitors, a position accepted by the prosecution. The 
absence of a register entry or prior permission, a factor to be taken into 
consideration, is not sufficient reason to discard bounteous and credible 
evidence and material establishing that Brij Bihari Prasad, a political 
leader with influence, had numerous visitors and supporters meeting him 
at 
the 
hospital. 
The 
fardbeyan 
(Exhibit-50)

Page 16 of 40 
 
evidence of Rama Devi14 (PW-24) and Mahanth Ashwani Das15 (PW-
25), establish the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and other 
visitors. Further, the following witness accounts establish the presence 
of visitors and eyewitnesses:  
➢ Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) has deposed and accepted the 
presence of Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-
42), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) and 7-8 other persons.   
➢ Arbind Singh (PW-13), who was declared hostile, accepted that 
Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-
42) and 5-7 other persons had come to the hospital.   
➢ Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14), the injured witness who also turned 
hostile, deposed to the presence of two other persons 
accompanying Brij Bihari Prasad.  
 
Once the presence of a witness at the place of occurrence is 
proven, their testimony, if credible and truthful, should not be dismissed 
solely based on non-compliance with hospital and prison protocols. 
 
15. 
The reasoning given by the High Court to disregard and doubt the 
eyewitness account of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), on the premise 
that he ought to have been the informant because he is the brother-in-
law of Brij Bihari Prasad and was present at the hospital at the time of 
occurrence, is conjectural and unfounded. This fact cannot ipso facto 
 
14 See para 23. 
15 See para 17(ii).  
 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 17 of 40 
 
lead to the disavowal of his testimony. Such a presumption imposes a 
rigid formula for determining who should be an informant, which the law 
does not envision. It is an accepted and admitted position that the name 
of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) has been mentioned in the fardbeyan 
and in the FIR as one of the persons present at the hospital. Any person 
can be an informant of a case, and the police may also register a case 
on their own. The rationale of the High Court for dismissing the testimony 
of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) is fundamentally flawed.  
 
16. 
Yet another reason for rejecting his testimony stems from contradictions 
about the presence of Rajan Tiwari (A-9) as an assailant at the hospital. 
In his police statement, Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) identified Rajan 
Tiwari (A-9) as being at the hospital, but in his court testimony, he stated 
that Rajan Tiwari (A-9) was not present. In our considered view, this 
contradiction does not weaken Paras Nath Chaudhury’s (PW-1) account 
of witnessing Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna 
Shukla (A-8) commit the offence. Indian law does not recognise the 
doctrine – falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. In Deep Chand and Others 
v. State of Haryana16, this Court had observed that the maxim falsus in 
uno, falsus in omnibus is not a sound rule to apply in the conditions of 
this country. This maxim does not occupy the status of rule of law. It is 
merely a rule of caution which involves the question of the weight of 
evidence that a court may apply in the given set of circumstances.17 In 
 
16 (1969) 3 SCC 890. 
17 Ponnam Chandraiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh, (2008) 11 SCC 640.

cases where a witness is found to have given unreliable evidence, it is 
the duty of the court to carefully scrutinise the rest of the evidence, sifting 
the grain from the chaff. The reliable evidence can be relied upon 
especially when the substratum of the prosecution case remains intact. 
The court must be diligent in separating truth from falsehood. Only in 
exceptional circumstances, when truth and falsehood are so inextricably 
connected as to make it indistinguishable, should the entire body of 
evidence be discarded. 
 
Testimony of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) 
 
17. 
The deposition of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) equally supports the 
prosecution case. His testimony captures the following: 
(i) 
On 13.06.1998, he reached IGIMS hospital at about 7:00 p.m. to 
meet Brij Bihari Prasad. 
(ii) He confirmed the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1). 
Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi 
Bhushan Singh (PW-42), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Ram 
Nandan Singh (PW-12), Onkar Singh and some other people at the 
hospital. 
(iii) After a passing remark by Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) that it 
was hot in the hospital room, Brij Bihari Prasad stepped outside for 
a stroll. Brij Bihari Prasad was accompanied by Ram Niranjan 
Chaudhary (A-6), Lakshmeshwar Sahu and other security 
personnel. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 19 of 40 
 
(iv) In the meanwhile, a Sumo car and an Ambassador car came inside 
the hospital campus.  About 10-12 persons alighted from the said 
vehicles and moved toward Brij Bihari Prasad. 
(v) Mantu Tiwari (A-4) was carrying a carbine and others were carrying 
pistols. 
(vi) He specifically identified Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased), 
Shri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash Shukla (since deceased), 
Rajan Tiwari (A-9), Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) and 
Satish Pandey as the persons who alighted from the 
aforementioned vehicles. 
(vii) Mantu Tiwari (A-4), Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) and 
Shri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash Shukla (since deceased) 
fired at Brij Bihari Prasad. Others were also firing indiscriminately 
in different directions. 
(viii) Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Satish Pandey and 
Rajan Tiwari (A-9) shot at Lakshmeshwar Sahu. 
(ix) On being shot, Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu 
collapsed. 
(x) Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) took the carbine 
belonging to Lakshmeshwar Sahu and thereafter exclaimed that 
the work had been done. He raised the slogan “Jai Bajrang Bali”. 
(xi) His signed statement (Exhibit-29) was also recorded by a judicial 
magistrate. 
(xii) The occurrence took place at about 8:30 p.m. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 20 of 40 
 
(xiii) The police and CBI had interrogated him in this regard. 
 
18. 
We have carefully scrutinized the cross-examination of Mahanth Ashwini 
Das (PW-25). His cross-examination states: 
(i) 
Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) was introduced to Brij Bihari 
Prasad in 1996. This was around the same time Mahanth Ashwani 
Das (PW-25) became a disciple under Sanatan Dharma. 
(ii) 
He had also known Rama Devi (PW-24), wife of Brij Bihari Prasad, 
since 1996. 
(iii) Rama Devi (PW-24) was present in the court while his testimony 
was being recorded. However, Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) 
denies speaking to her. 
(iv) Mahanth Ashwini Das (PW-25) states that while there was no 
particular reason to meet Brij Bihari Prasad on 13.06.1998, he 
would generally meet Brij Bihari Prasad whilst in Patna. 
(v) 
Earlier also he had visited Brij Bihari Prasad in the hospital on 
another occasion, but he could not remember the date and time of 
this meeting. 
(vi) He met Brij Bihari Prasad approximately 8-10 days prior to the date 
of incident. 
(vii) He did not know the specific treatment for which Brij Bihari Prasad 
was admitted to the hospital. He states that the treatment had been 
going on for about one and a half months. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 21 of 40 
 
(viii) He denies having knowledge of any case(s) pending against Brij 
Bihari Prasad. 
(ix) He states that he is unaware of any case pending against him. 
However, he accepts that way back in 1979, a murder case was 
registered against him, for which he had remained in jail for 3-4 
months. 
(x) 
He states that he was sentenced to life imprisonment and filed an 
appeal in 1987; however, he was uncertain whether the appeal 
was still pending or had been dismissed, and he could not recall 
the grounds for the appeal. 
(xi) He did not have any documentary proof of visiting the hospital on 
13.06.1998. 
(xii) He had not made any signatures on the death summary report and 
the seizure memo. 
(xiii) He did not know if the wife of Onkar Singh (since deceased) had 
given a police statement that her husband was murdered by Brij 
Bihari Prasad due to a contract dispute. 
(xiv) Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) had deposed about remaining at 
the place of occurrence after the firing. He saw the police coming 
and lifting the dead bodies of Brij Bihari Prasad and 
Lakshmeshwar Sahu.  He left the hospital for the residence of Brij 
Bihari Prasad at 9:30 p.m., where several people, including 
Kamakhya Narain Singh (PW-15), Shiv Ji Prasad, Ram Nandan 
Singh (PW-12), Onkar Singh, and Raj Bala Verma (Collector, 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 22 of 40 
 
Patna), had already gathered. Later that night, on 14.06.1998, 
around 12:30 a.m., he departed for Muzzaffarpur Math. 
(xv) He was arrested on 04.05.2006 in Patna. Thereafter, he was given 
protection by the Bihar Government to give evidence in the present 
trial.  Armed security guards, who were generally not present with 
him, used to accompany him whilst going to the court. 
(xvi) He states that he used to reach Smriti Bhawan of Brij Bihari Prasad 
at about 5:00 a.m. Rama Devi (PW-24), her driver and security 
guards reside at the Smriti Bhawan. 
(xvii) During the firing he had hidden about 30-40 steps away from the 
hospital room. 
(xviii)He denies the suggestion of giving false evidence due to his close 
relationship with Brij Bihari Prasad. 
 
19. 
As noted above, the High Court has rejected the testimony and 
complicity of the accused by Mahant Ashwani Das (PW-25) on the 
ground that he is himself an accused in a murder case and had 
absconded despite being convicted in appeal, while he was being 
examined as a witness in the present case. The High Court had also held 
that Mahant Ashwani Das (PW-25) had the patronage of Rama Devi 
(PW-24) and the deceased Brij Bihari Prasad. 
 
20. 
The criminal background of a witness necessitates that the courts 
approach their evidence with caution. The testimony of a witness with a 
chequered past cannot be dismissed as untruthful or uncreditworthy 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 23 of 40 
 
without considering the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case, 
including their presence at the scene of the offence. In cases involving 
conflicts between rival gangs or groups, the testimony of members from 
either side is admissible and relevant. If the court is convinced of the 
veracity and truthfulness of such testimony, it may be considered. Courts 
typically assess the broader context to determine if there is sufficient 
corroboration, as long as there are no valid reasons to discredit the 
evidence. The crucial test is whether the witness is truly an eyewitness 
and whether their testimony is credible. If their presence at the scene is 
established beyond doubt, their account of the incident can be relied 
upon. Such evidence cannot be discarded merely on the grounds of 
criminal background.18 
 
Testimony of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) 
 
21. 
No doubt, Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) turned hostile, but his core 
deposition captures the following: 
(i) 
He accepts having recorded the fardbeyan (Exhibit-50) on 
13.06.1998 at about 9 p.m. It bears his signatures which are 
marked Exhibits 12 and 12/1. 
(ii) He had gone to the hospital at about 6:00 – 6:30 p.m. Some of the 
people, including Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi Bhushan Singh 
(PW-42) and 7-8 other persons, whom he did not remember, 
accompanied him. 
 
18 See State of U.P. v. Farid Khan and Others, (2005) 9 SCC 103. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 24 of 40 
 
(iii) He met Brij Bihari Prasad at about 6:30 p.m. in the ward. He states 
that the incident took place at about 8:15 p.m., and he, along with 
the others, stayed there till after the incident. 
(iv) At the time of the incident, Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) along 
with Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42), Ram 
Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) and some others, had come out for a 
stroll with Brij Bihari Prasad. 
(v) Two vehicles, a Sumo and an Ambassador car, had come in. 5-6 
persons alighted from the two vehicles and moved towards Brij 
Bihari Prasad. Thereafter, one of the assailants pointed towards 
Brij Bihari Prasad, identifying him as the Minister. The assailants 
then started firing. Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu 
were shot at, and they collapsed.  Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-
10) and others ran towards the parking lot. One of the accused took 
the carbine of Lakshmeshwar Sahu. While exiting the hospital, 
slogans of “Jai Bajrang Bali” were raised by the assailants. They 
exited in the same vehicles from the east gate. 
(vi) He does not remember the registration number of the vehicles. He, 
along with the other visitors present there, had informed the 
hospital staff, who in turn, informed the police. 
(vii) He identified Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) and Mantu 
Tiwari (A-4).  He could not identify the other accused. He claimed 
that Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) and Mantu Tiwari 
(A-4) were carrying pistols. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 25 of 40 
 
(viii) Mantu Tiwari (A-4) was not present in the court when Amarendra 
Kumar Sinha (PW-10) was being examined. However, he identified 
Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) who was present in the court. 
(ix) As he did not recognize the other accused, he was declared hostile 
and was allowed to be cross-examined by the prosecution. 
(x) In his cross-examination, he denied that Mantu Tiwari (A-4) fired 
from his sten gun. 
(xi) He also denied the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), 
claiming that he had not seen him in the hospital. 
(xii) However, he accepts in the cross-examination that he had put his 
signatures on the fardbeyan.  
(xiii) He was not cross-examined at length by the defence. 
 
22. 
We have already referred to judgments of this Court while examining the 
doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. The same principles equally 
apply when the court examines the statement of a witness who has been 
declared hostile by the prosecution. In a catena of judgments, this Court 
has observed that the evidence of a hostile witness is not to be 
completely rejected, so as to exclude versions that support the 
prosecution. Rather, the testimony of the hostile witness is to be 
subjected to close scrutiny, thus enabling the court to separate truth from 
falsehood, exaggerations and improvements. Only reliable evidence 
should be taken into consideration. The court is not denuded of its power 
to make an appropriate assessment. The entire testimony of a hostile 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 26 of 40 
 
witness is discarded only when the judge, as a matter of prudence, finds 
the witness wholly discredited, warranting the exclusion of the evidence 
in toto.19 The creditworthy portions of the testimony should be considered 
for the purpose of evidence in the case. It is in this context that we have 
to examine the testimony of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), the 
complainant/informant, who gave the fardbeyan (Exhibit P-50) on which 
basis the FIR (Exhibit P-50/51) was registered. 
 
Testimony of Rama Devi (PW-24) 
 
23. 
Rama Devi (PW-24) confirmed the presence of the witnesses – Paras 
Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and 
Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) at the IGIMS hospital. On 13.06.1998, 
Rama Devi (PW-24) had taken food to the hospital at about 2:50 p.m. 
and stayed there till about 7:00 p.m. From the hospital, she went to 
Maurya Lok to purchase some items for her sons and remained there for 
about one and a half hours. Whilst leaving Maurya Lok, she learnt about 
the attack on her husband, Brij Bihari Prasad. She immediately reached 
IGIMS hospital where she saw Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar 
Sahu lying dead in a pool of blood. Several people had gathered there. 
She established the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), 
Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) 
at the hospital.  
 
 
19 See C. Muniappan and Others v. State of Tamil Nadu, (2010) 9 SCC 567. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 27 of 40 
 
24. 
We will exclude the testimony of Rama Devi (PW-24) regarding the 
individuals who arrived in the two vehicles and the detailed version about 
the occurrence which she heard from the people present there, including 
Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and 
Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), which is hearsay. However, her 
testimony establishing the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), 
Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) 
is direct evidence and cannot be discarded. Rama Devi (PW-24) was at 
the hospital for a considerable time before and after the incident. Her 
version is factually accurate and fosters confidence. Thus, the testimony 
of Rama Devi (PW-24) can be used to partly corroborate and affirm the 
testimonies of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das 
(PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10). 
 
25. 
The testimony of Rama Devi (PW-24) is also relevant from the point of 
view of motive, a question which is not contentious, as is clear from the 
questions posed to her in her cross-examination. She has affirmed 
having contested the Lok Sabha elections against Devendra Nath 
Dubey, who was murdered. Brij Bihari Prasad, her husband, was 
implicated in the said case as an accused. Her husband was also 
arrested in MEDHA scam by the CBI. He was subsequently lodged in 
Beur Jail. Due to his ill health, he was taken to  Patna Medical College 
from where he was referred to IGIMS hospital. 
 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 28 of 40 
 
26. Mantu Tiwari (A-4) is the nephew of the late Bhupendra Nath Dubey 
(since deceased), who was the brother of Devendra Nath Dubey, a 
political rival of Rama Devi (PW-24). Devendra Nath Dubey was killed a 
day before the re-poll for the Motihari Lok Sabha Constituency. Brij Bihari 
Prasad was named as an accused in the case. The longstanding 
animosity is further highlighted by the fact that Vijay Kumar Shukla @ 
Munna Shukla (A-8) is the brother of Chottan Shukla and Bhutkun 
Shukla, who were allegedly killed by the henchmen of Brij Bihari Prasad. 
Further, Rama Devi (PW-24) testified that in 1987, there was an 
assassination attempt on her husband, Brij Bihari Prasad, statedly 
orchestrated at the behest of Raghunath Pandey (chargesheeted in the 
present case but since deceased), with Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna 
Shukla (A-8), Chottan Shukla and Bhutkun Shukla involved in the attack.  
 
Identification and non-recovery of vehicles and weapons  
 
27. 
Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) have 
identified the vehicles used by the accused on 13.06.1998. They have 
specifically deposed about a Sumo bearing registration no. BR-1P-1818. 
The Sumo and the Ambassador cars, which they have referred to in their 
depositions, were not recovered. The weapons used in the offence, 
including the carbine belonging to the deceased Lakshmeshwar Sahu, 
also could not be recovered. However, given the facts and 
circumstances of the case, the failure of the police to recover the vehicles 
and the weapons is not sufficient to undermine the credibility of the 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 29 of 40 
 
eyewitness accounts or the corroborative evidence regarding the cause 
of the homicidal deaths of Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu. 
The ocular version of the witnesses should not be disregarded solely 
because the weapon used in the crime and the vehicles allegedly used 
by the accused were not located or seized by the police.20 
 
28. 
It is significant to note that the vehicle No. BR-1P-1818 (Sumo), as per 
the deposition of the second IO, Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54), had 
been taken under a hire-purchase agreement by the late Devendra Nath 
Dubey, brother of Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased), from a 
finance company – SBR Private Limited, Calcutta. The said assertion 
had remained unchallenged in the cross-examination of Shashi Bhushan 
Sharma (PW-54). The vehicle No. BR-1P-1818 is also mentioned in the 
fardbeyan (Exhibit P-50) of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10). 
 
Forwarding of the FIR 
 
29. 
The impugned judgment has observed that the FIR (Exhibits 51 and 
51/1) is ante-timed. The High Court, in its reasoning, highlights this as 
one of the grounds for acquitting the accused. In the present case, the 
first IO, SSP Yadav, passed away before he could depose. However, 
registration of the FIR itself is not in doubt and debate and has been 
deposed to by Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10). We have evidence 
with regard to the statement of eye-witnesses which were recorded 
 
20 See Yogesh Singh v. Mahabeer Singh and Others, (2017) 11 SCC 195 which refers to several other 
decisions. See also State of Rajasthan v. Arjun Singh and Others (2011) 9 SCC 115. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 30 of 40 
 
under Section 161 CrPC on the night of occurrence, as is clear from the 
depositions of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das 
(PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10). The inquest reports of 
Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu (Exhibits 42/1 and 52) were 
prepared on the same night and, thereafter, the post-mortem was 
conducted by Dr. Arvind Kumar Singh (PW-7) at 12:30 a.m. and 1:30 
a.m. respectively on 14.06.1998.  
 
30. 
The occurrence having taken place at night on 13.06.1998, normally the 
FIR should have been sent to the jurisdictional magistrate on 
14.06.1998. However, 14.06.1998 being a Sunday was a holiday. The 
FIR was forwarded to the jurisdictional magistrate on 15.06.1998. There 
is, therefore, an explanation for the delay in forwarding a copy of the FIR 
to the jurisdictional magistrate in terms of Section 157 of the CrPC. It is 
trite law that a delay in forwarding the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate 
is not fatal to the prosecution case. This Court, in State of Rajasthan v. 
Daud Khan21, has examined the case law on the subject and held that 
when there is a delay in forwarding the FIR to the jurisdictional 
magistrate and the accused raises a specific contention regarding the 
same, they must demonstrate how this delay has prejudiced their case. 
Mere delay by itself is not sufficient to discard and disbelieve the case of 
the prosecution. If the investigation starts in right earnest and there is 
sufficient material on record to show that the accused were named and 
 
21 (2016) 2 SCC 607. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 31 of 40 
 
pinpointed, the prosecution case can be accepted when evidence 
implicates the accused. The requirement to dispatch and serve a copy 
of the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate is an external check against 
ante dating or ante timing of the FIR to ensure that there is no 
manipulation or interpolation in the FIR. If the court finds the witnesses 
to be truthful and credible, the lack of a cogent explanation for the delay 
may not be regarded as detrimental. 
 
Police Statements of Eye-witnesses 
 
31. 
The High Court, in its reasoning, takes an exception on the minor 
discrepancies regarding the place and time of recording the statement 
under Section 161 CrPC of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25). Similarly, 
the impugned judgment has adversely commented on the versions given 
by Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) 
as to who had reached the hospital at an earlier point in time. 
Considering the efflux of time of more than 4-6 years between the date 
of occurrence and recording of court testimony, these issues are at best 
superficial and peripheral and would not warrant disregarding the 
prosecution case. The questions posed to the witnesses were more in 
the nature of a memory test rather than questions posed to test the 
truthfulness and credibility of their core testimony. Equally, the 
observation of the High Court on the statement under Section 161 CrPC 
of Rama Devi (PW-24) to Rai Singh Khatri (PW-62), IO of the CBI, is 
inconsequential. Section 161 CrPC statement of Rama Devi, in which 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 32 of 40 
 
she had given the names and details of the persons who were present 
in the hospital, cannot be brushed aside solely on this ground. 
Statements under Section 161 CrPC are per se not evidence in the court. 
Rama Devi’s statement under Section 161 CrPC was recorded on 
13.06.1998 and the same was filed along with the chargesheet. She was 
not cross-examined regarding the said statement. 
 
32. 
The assertion that Rama Devi’s (PW-24) Section 161 CrPC statement 
dated 13.06.1998 to Shashi Bhushan Sharma, IO (PW-54), has not been 
included in the record is solely predicated on her cross-examination 
conducted on 21.02.2006. Rama Devi's (PW-24) acknowledgement 
during her cross-examination reflects a clear lapse in memory, likely due 
to the nearly eight-year gap and the length of her questioning. It is a well-
established fact that SSP Yadav was the IO on 13.06.1998, making it 
impossible for Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54) to have recorded her 
Section 161 CrPC statement on that date. Moreover, Shashi Bhushan 
Sharma (PW-54) was never questioned about whether he had recorded 
Rama Devi’s (PW-24) Section 161 CrPC statement on 13.06.1998. In 
fact, both the defence and prosecution agree that Shashi Bhushan 
Sharma (PW-54) took over the investigation on 14.07.1998. 
 
Attesting Witnesses and Retaliatory Firing 
 
33. 
The contention that Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and Mahanth 
Ashwani Das (PW-25) were not attesting witnesses to the inquest report, 
fardbeyan, FIR, etc. is inconsequential and does not in any way weaken 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 33 of 40 
 
their ocular evidence. Similarly, the contention that they were not injured 
during the cross-fire is nugatory as it is clear from the evidence on record 
that it was Brij Bihari Prasad who was the target of the attack. The armed 
bodyguards who were attacked had retaliated. Although it is true that the 
depositions of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and Mahanth Ashwani Das 
(PW-25) do not mention the retaliatory firing by the bodyguards, an 
independently proven fact, this alone is not a sufficient ground to dismiss 
their presence at the spot or their versions including the culpability of the 
persons who had committed the offence. 
 
Offence under Section 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC 
34. 
Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14) had averred to his presence at IGIMS hospital 
on 13.06.1998 in the evening at about 7-7:30 p.m. when he was shot at 
and received a bullet injury in his left arm during the attack on Brij Bihari 
Prasad. He called his brother, Sanjeev Kumar, who took him to Alok 
Nursing Home for treatment. Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14), however, did 
not identify the culprits. Dr. Tarkeshwar Prasad Singh (PW-8) examined 
injured Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14) on 13.06.1998 at 9:30 P.M. and issued 
the injury report dated 08.08.1998 (Exhibit-10). The deposition of Dr. 
Tarkeshwar Prasad Singh (PW-8) refers to the entry and exit wounds on 
the left arm of Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14) inflicted by a gunshot 
approximately two hours before the medical examination. In any case, it 
is proven that in spite of the number of people present, there was 
extensive firing and the use of firearms with intent to kill. The charge 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 34 of 40 
 
under Section 307 of the IPC is, therefore, established and proved. 
 
The Charge of Criminal Conspiracy 
 
35. 
The case was transferred to CBI by Notification dated 07.03.1999, 
pursuant to which it conducted an investigation. The CBI filed two 
supplementary chargesheets implicating Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Ram 
Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7) and Raghunath 
Pandey, who had since died, as conspirators who were responsible for 
the incident. A supplementary chargesheet was filed against Shashi 
Kumar Rai (A-7) on 08.11.2000, followed by a second supplementary 
chargesheet dated 20.04.2001 against Raghunath Pandey.  
 
36. 
The prosecution case makes a charge of conspiracy based on an alleged 
meeting which took place in Beur Jail where Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) was 
incarcerated. Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) is said to have reportedly met with 
Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Lallan Singh (A-3) and Ram 
Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6). However, the witnesses to this meeting, Sone 
Lal (PW-32) and Lal Babu Chaudhury (PW-39), turned hostile and did 
not support the prosecution version. This evidence is based on the 
testimony of Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54) that Sone Lal (PW-32) 
and Lal Babu Chaudhury (PW-39) informed him about the said jail 
meeting on 19.08.1998, nearly two months after the date of occurrence. 
Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-52) failed to establish how he discovered 
the purported version of Sone Lal (PW-32) and Lal Babu Chaudhury 
(PW-39). He was also unable to establish that Sanjay Singh, the inmate 
whom Sone Lal (PW-32) and Lal Babu Chaudhury (PW-39) had 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 35 of 40 
 
allegedly visited, was present in Beur Jail 2-3 days before the incident. 
There is no record of Sone Lal (PW-32) and Lal Babu Chaudhury (PW-
39) visiting Beur Jail.  
 
37. 
Further, the claim of the prosecution regarding the dubious character of 
Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) and that he encouraged Brij Bihari 
Prasad to go outside his hospital room for a walk is not directly 
implicatory. Rather, it is an assumption requiring substantial evidence to 
be established. It only expresses doubt about Ram Niranjan Chaudhary 
(A-6), an insider who could have given information.  
 
38. 
To prove the charge of conspiracy, the prosecution further relied upon 
the telephone records of Mokama landline number 32772, which was 
supposedly subscribed to by Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1). The telephone 
records indicate calls made from Mokama landline number 32772 to 
Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7), Sunil Singh (A-5) (since deceased) and Munna 
Shuka (A-8). The prosecution relied on the report dated 29.10.1999 
(Exhibit-1) submitted by Shiya Sharan Ram (PW-2), Sub-Divisional 
Engineer (Vigilance), Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, which stated that 
the landline number was subscribed in the name of one Shrawan Kumar 
Agrawal but was operational in the house of Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) at 
Mokama. However, the said report of Shiya Sharan Ram (PW-2) is 
based on the physical verification of S.M.M. Rahman, Sub-Divisional 
Engineer, Barh and Jitan Mehta, Junior Telecom Officer, Hatida, both of 
whom, have not been examined. Further, Shrawan Kumar Agrawal has 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 36 of 40 
 
also not been examined. The original report prepared by S.M.M. 
Rahman and Jitan Mehta is also not on record. The prosecution version 
establishing the landline number as belonging to Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) 
hinges on the testimony of M.L. Meena (PW-60), Assistant IO, CBI. 
However, M.L. Meena (PW-60) accepts in his testimony that he did not 
enter the house to verify the existence of a telephone set. Rather, his 
entire version is based on his interaction with the step-mother of Suraj 
Bhan Singh (A-1). The telephone records indicating the exchange of 
calls between 11.05.1998 and 11.06.1998, as deposed by Rai Singh 
Khatri (PW-62), do not substantively prove and establish the conspiracy 
charge in the absence of revelatory and weighty incriminating material. 
 
39. 
The CBI also relied upon the post-incident celebration held in village 
Khanjah Ghat on 15.06.1998 at the behest of Vijay Kumar Shukla @ 
Munna Shukla (A-8). Amod Kumar (PW-11), Sushil Kumar Singh (PW-
35) and Pooja (PW-37), who were statedly witnesses to the post-incident 
celebration turned hostile. The statement of Avadhesh Kumar Singh 
(PW-36), who did not turn hostile, was recorded one year and two 
months after the date of occurrence. The prosecution has not placed any 
material on record to showcase how M.L. Meena, IO, CBI (PW-60) had 
traced Avadhesh Kumar Singh (PW-36), though Rai Singh Khatri, IO, 
CBI (PW-62) had stated that M.L. Meena, IO, CBI (PW-60) had got in 
touch with Avadhesh Kumar Singh (PW-36). The evidence of Avadhesh 
Kumar Singh (PW-36) and Pooja (PW-37) establishing the presence of 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 37 of 40 
 
Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7), since deceased, in the post-incident celebration 
is not entirely credible. In any case, Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7) passed 
away during the pendency of the present appeals.  
 
40. 
To fortify the charge of conspiracy, the prosecution has further relied on 
the fax message (Exhibit-6) regarding the threat to the life of Brij Bihari 
Prasad. This fax message would not help the prosecution implicate the 
accused persons – Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Mukesh Singh (A-2), Lallan 
Singh (A-3) and Captain Sunil Singh (A-5) (since deceased) – on the 
charge of criminal conspiracy. 
 
Discrepancy regarding the presence of Rajan Tiwari (A-9) 
 
41. 
As noticed above, Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) in his deposition had 
categorically stated that Rajan Tiwari (A-9) was not present with the 
other accused who had murdered Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar 
Sahu. Even though Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) had referred to the 
presence of Rajan Tiwari (A-9), given the discrepancy in the statement 
of the two eye-witnesses, we feel that the benefit of doubt must be given 
to Rajan Tiwari (A-9). 
 
Conclusion 
 
42. 
Even if we completely exclude the testimony of Shashi Bhushan Singh 
(PW-42), the depositions of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth 
Ashwani Das (PW-25) and, to some extent of Rama Devi (PW-24) and 
Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) with other evidence and material are 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 38 of 40 
 
conclusive enough to prove the charge against Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and 
Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8). Bhupendra Nath Dubey and 
Captain Sunil Singh (A-5) are no more, and, therefore, we need not 
consider the evidence against them. Similarly, we need not examine the 
depositions implicating Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7), who died during the 
pendency of the present appeals. 
 
43. 
Regarding the question of conspiracy and the evidence against Suraj 
Bhan Singh (A-1), Mukesh Singh (A-2), Lallan Singh (A-3) and Ram 
Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), there is no direct ocular evidence implicating 
them through the testimonies of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and 
Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25). Since the charge of conspiracy is not 
substantiated, we will not interfere with the judgment of the High Court 
acquitting them, and they are entitled to the benefit of the doubt. 
 
44. 
In light of the above discussion, we hold and direct as under: 
a) 
The charge under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC 
against Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna 
Shukla (A-8) for the murders of Brij Bihari Prasad and 
Lakshmeshwar Sahu is proven and established beyond reasonable 
doubt. 
b) 
The charge under Section 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC 
against Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna 
Shukla (A-8) for attempting to murder, as held in paragraph 34 
above, is proven and established beyond reasonable doubt. 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors. 
 
Page 39 of 40 
 
c) 
The conviction and sentence awarded to Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and 
Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) by the trial court under 
Sections 302 and 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC are affirmed 
and restored. 
d) 
Consequently, Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ 
Munna Shukla (A-8) shall have to undergo imprisonment for life with 
a fine of Rs. 20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand Only) each under 
Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC, and in addition to 
undergo rigorous imprisonment for five years with a fine of Rs. 
20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand Only) each under Section 307 
read with Section 34 of the IPC. Both the sentences shall run 
concurrently. Section 428 of the CrPC shall apply. As default 
punishment was not imposed by the trial court, we direct that in case 
of non-payment of fine on each account, Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and 
Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) shall undergo rigorous 
imprisonment for six months.  
e) 
Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) 
are directed to surrender within two weeks from today to the 
concerned jail authorities/court to serve the remainder of their 
respective sentences. In case of failure to surrender, the authorities 
shall take appropriate measures to arrest and detain them in 
accordance with law. 
f) 
Insofar as Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Mukesh Singh (A-2), Lallan 
Singh (A-3), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) and Rajan Tiwari (A-9) 

 
 
Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 & Ors.

are concerned, we give them benefit of doubt and uphold their 
acquittal. 
 
45. 
The appeals are partially allowed and the impugned judgment is set 
aside in terms and vide the directions issued in paragraph 44 above. 
Pending applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of.
