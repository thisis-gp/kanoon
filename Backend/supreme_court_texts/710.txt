Nagpur Bench.  For the sake of convenience appellants 
are referred to hereafter in this judgment in accordance 
with the order of their rank as accused before the trial 
Court. Criminal Appeal No.1614/2018 stood abated as 
the sole appellant who was the first accused and the sole 
appellant before the Additional Sessions Judge in 
Criminal Appeal No.64/1997, died on 06.03.2022 and 
hence, the rest of the appellants in the appeals are, at 
times, commonly referred to as ‘appellant-convicts’.  The 
appellant-convicts stood the trial for offences punishable 
under Sections 302, 330, 331, 342, 343, 348, 354, 385, 387, 
193, 201, 202, 203, and 218 read with Section 34, IPC, in 
connection with the death of one Shama @ Kaliya s/o 
Nanu Uke.  Though accused No.8 (Sudhir s/o Rambhau 
Kayarkar) and accused No.9 (Ganesh s/o Raghuji 
Turkar) were acquitted of the twin offences charged 
against them under Sections 201 and 202, IPC, read with 
Section 34, IPC, the respondent State did not file an 
appeal against their acquittal before the High Court. 
2. 
For the sake of convenience, the offence(s) for 
which each one of the appellant-convicts (accused Nos. 
2 to 7) was convicted and the sentence(s) imposed 
therefor, by the trial Court, can be enumerated as

3. 
All 
the 
corporeal 
punishments 
of 
rigorous 
imprisonment imposed on the appellant-convicts were 
directed to be run concurrently.  Default sentences were 
also ordered in respect of sentences for payment of fine. 
4. 
Against the judgment of conviction, accused Nos.6 
and 7 jointly filed Criminal Appeal No.65/1997, accused 
Nos. 2 and 4 jointly filed Criminal Appeal No.76/1997, 
accused Nos. 3 and 5 separately filed Criminal Appeal 
No.77/1997 and 71/1997 respectively and the State filed 
Criminal Appeal No.88/1997 against all the convicts.  
Obviously, the State challenged acquittal of all the 
accused for the offences punishable under Sections 302 
and 354 read with Section 34, IPC, while the aforesaid 
accused persons challenged their conviction under all 
the aforesaid sections for which they were convicted and 
sentenced. 
5. 
As per the impugned common judgment, the High 
Court dismissed the appeal filed by the State and partly 
allowed the appeals filed by the appellant-convicts.  
According to the appellant-convicts, the High Court 
acquitted all of them of the offences punishable under 
Section 201 read with Section 34, IPC.   In other words, in 
respect of all the other offences for which each of them 
was found guilty and consequently convicted and 

Page 5 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
sentenced, their appeals were dismissed.  It is to be 
noted that despite the dismissal of Criminal Appeal 
No.88/1997 filed by the State and acquittal of all the 
appellant-convicts of the offence under Section 201 read 
with Section 34, IPC assigning specific reasons the State 
of Maharashtra did not move this Court against the said 
common judgment dated 12.07.2011.  
6. 
Heard learned senior counsel Sh. Nagamuthu 
appearing for the appellant-convicts and Sh. Shrirang B. 
Varma, learned counsel for the State. 
7. 
The case of the prosecution, in succinct, is as 
follows: - 
Deceased Shama @ Kalya, S/o Nanu Uke, a history 
sheeter, was taken into police custody for interrogation 
in connection with an incident of house-breaking at one 
Vijay Agrawal’s residence in Gondia and stealing 
properties worth more than rupees one lakh on 
07.12.1995 and without duly recording the arrest he was 
kept in custody.  The suspect Shama @ Kalya was 
subjected to third degree methods during interrogation, 
resulting in his death on 22.12.1995.  On 31.12.1995, an 
un-identified body, which was burnt and buried, was 
found in the forest within the jurisdiction of Tirodi police 
station in Balaghat district of the State of Madhya 

Page 6 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
Pradesh.  It is the further case of the prosecution that after 
committing 
heinous 
crime 
the 
appellant-convicts 
concocted a case and contrived false evidence to escape 
prosecution for custodial death by making one Dipak 
Lokhande disguised as Shama @ Kalya and taking him 
under cover to Bhanpur and Survai to Mulchand Radhelal 
and Tasanbai respectively on the night of 24.12.1995.  It 
is also the case of the prosecution that the appellant-
convicts made Dipak Lokhande to run away from the 
jeep to make it appear that Shama @ Kalya had escaped 
from custody.  Thereupon, PW-38 Harne was informed 
about it and entry to that effect was made in the station-
diary and consequently, false inquiry was made and 
documents were also prepared. 
8. 
The facts narrated above would reveal that going 
by the case of the prosecution, it is a case of custodial 
torture leading to custodial death. 
9. 
The Trial Court, after appreciating the evidence 
found that the prosecution had failed to establish the 
charge punishable under Section 302, IPC, and 
concluded that the prosecution had succeeded only in 
establishing charge under Section 304 -II read with 
Section 34 against accused numbers 1 to 3.  True that 
they and the others, barring accused Nos. 8 and 9, were 

Page 7 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
found guilty under certain other charged offences as 
well, and accordingly sentenced therefor, as mentioned 
hereinbefore.  However, in the appeals by the appellant-
convicts the High Court confirmed the conviction and 
sentences except under Section 201 read with Section 34 
IPC.   The acquittal of accused numbers 8 & 9 by the trial 
Court was not challenged by the State before the High 
Court.  So also, the acquittal of the appellants under 
Section 201 read with Section 34, IPC by the High Court 
is not now under challenge.  In short, the captioned 
appeals carry only the challenge of the convicts against 
their conviction under the different sections of the IPC 
and consequently imposed sentences therefor, as 
mentioned hereinbefore. 
10. 
The learned senior counsel appearing for the 
appellants would submit that there is no serious 
challenge against the conviction of the appellants for 
custodial torture.  Nonetheless, a feeble attempt was, 
indeed, made by the learned senior counsel to convince 
me that the appellants are entitled to a plain acquittal in 
respect of all the charges for which they were found 
guilty and were confirmed by the High Court under the 
impugned judgment.  Then, serious contentions were 
advanced with respect to the conviction for the custodial 

Page 8 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
death under Section 304-II read with Section 34 IPC and 
the consequential sentence imposed on the appellants.  
Having heard the rival contentions and bestowing 
anxious consideration I am of the considered view that 
even otherwise, contentions in respect of the finding on 
the charge of custodial torture warrant no serious 
consideration and the conviction and consequently 
imposed sentences, therefore, under different sections 
hereinafter to be mentioned specifically invite no 
interference. 
11. 
The facts that deceased Shama @ Kalya was taken 
into police custody on the complaint of PW-6 Vijay 
Kumar Rameshwarlal Agrawal in crime No. 315 of 95 
registered at Gondia City Police Station and that the 
appellants took him to Detective Branch Room of Gondia 
Police Station for interrogation and in that regard 
detained him for days together without adhering to the 
legal mandate for production of the arrestee within 24 
hours, since his detention, before a Magistrate having 
jurisdiction in the case, remain irrefragable, rather, 
proved and unrebutted.   While the appellant-convicts 
contend that he is an escapado, the prosecution contends 
that he was subjected to custodial torture which 
ultimately culminated in his custodial death (The 

Page 9 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
defence also put forth a case that he was arrested later 
by the Railway Police in connection with traveling in a 
train ticketless and consequently prosecuted and 
sentenced to pay fine, to counter the case of the 
prosecution that escape of Shama from police custody 
was nothing but a staged drama).  In the contextual 
situation it is apposite to refer to the decision of this Court 
in Central Bureau of Investigation v. Kishore Singh1 
wherein it was held that when a person was brought to a 
police station and locked up, obviously, he would be 
under arrest.   
12. 
The evidence of PW-1 (Amrutabai Ukey), PW-3 and 
PW-16 and others as also PWs 20 and 22 who are police 
officials, was relied on by the trial Court and also by the 
High Court to hold that the deceased was in the custody 
of the appellants and was in the Detective Branch Room 
of Gondia Police Station and was subjected to torture 
during such custody.  PW-1 is the wife of deceased 
Shama.   She would depose that she found him in the 
Detective Branch Room of Gondia Police Station on 
18.12.1995 and he was then bleeding from his legs.  
According to her, Shama told that police have cut off 
 
1 (2011) 6 SCC 369 

Page 10 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
veins of his legs and hence, he might not survive.  She 
had also deposed that on 22.12.1995, she again found 
him there and on 24.12.1995, police told her that Shama 
had escaped from their custody.  I will deal with her 
evidence, a little later, appropriately.  PW-3 turned 
hostile.  He was examined to prove that Shama was 
brought to police station for interrogation and he had 
suffered injuries on account of torture during the 
interrogation.  Indisputably, while being examined-in-
chief, 
he 
supported 
the 
prosecution 
and 
then, 
prevaricated during his cross-examination.  Thereupon, 
he was cross-examined by the prosecution after getting 
him declared as hostile.  The impugned judgment would 
reveal that to a Court question, he would admit that what 
he had stated before the Court in the morning session, 
during cross-examination on behalf of the accused, was 
false.  The demeanor of the witness as recorded by the 
courts below and his oscillation during his examination 
before the Court thus revealed the danger in accepting 
his version, on any count, without corroboration.  Since 
the maxim ‘falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus’ (false in one 
thing, false in everything) has no application in India, his 
evidence was evidently taken into consideration to the 
extent of establishing the custody of Shama in the Station 

Page 11 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
and also his sustaining injuries during such custody as 
they got corroboration from the oral testimonies of other 
witnesses.  PW-4 Mulchand deposed that when he visited 
the police station concerned, he found swelling on the 
arms and legs of Shama besides bleeding from his legs.  
PW-16 was the mother-in-law of deceased Shama.  She 
would depose that she was taken to the police station and 
was kept there for two days and simultaneously herself 
and deceased Shama were beaten by the police.    PW-
20 is a Police Officer who was on duty in the said police 
station between 05.11.1995 and 19.12.1995.   He deposed 
that on 16.12.1995 at about 3 p.m. he visited the 
Detective Branch room of the Police Station and found 
Shama @ Kalya in the presence of accused numbers 1 to 
6.  It is to be noted that he would also depose that he 
found there an old woman and a girl aged about 16 
years.  He also deposed that a compounder by name Soni 
(PW-3) was called to the police station and he dressed 
the injuries of Shama.     PW-20 would further depose that 
on 19.12.1995 he was shifted to other duties.  PW-21 was 
a lady police constable.  She would depose that she was 
called to the Detective Branch Room and was asked to 
remain present when search was being conducted.  
According to her, she found Shama @ Kalya limping 

Page 12 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
when they went to Balaghat to search his house.  PW-22 
is another Police Officer by name Sumanbai Bharatram 
Madavi.  She deposed that on 20.12.1995 she was 
deputed to duty there and she found two female suspects 
sitting in the front room of the police station.  She also 
deposed that inside the room, she found a male suspect, 
said to be the husband of one of the ladies, sitting there.  
In view of the nature of the oral testimonies of the 
aforesaid witnesses and the concurrency in the 
appreciation of their evidence on the custody and torture 
of Shama from the detective branch room of Gondia 
Police Station, I do not find any reason whatsoever 
requiring a further consideration in regard to the 
confirmation of conviction for custodial torture. But at the 
same time, I may hasten to add that the sustainability of 
conviction and sentencing for some of the offences 
would depend on the sustainability of the conviction 
under Section 304 – Part II read with Section 34, IPC.  I 
may also hasten to add that though I decline to interfere 
with the finding that Shama was subjected to torture 
while being in custody I shall not be understood of 
having given imprimatur to the finding that veins of legs 
of Shama were cut and that ultimately caused his death 
as according to me, this question is intrinsically 

Page 13 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
intertwined with the challenge against the conviction 
under Section 304 – Part II, read with Section 34, IPC.  
One aspect with respect to the acquittal (or conviction) 
for the offence under Section 201 read with Section 34, 
IPC also requires consideration, which I will deal with a 
little later. 
13. 
While considering the question of sustainability of 
the conviction under Section 304-II read with Section 34, 
IPC, in view of the position obtained in this case, I am of 
the considered view that the observation of this Court in 
Noor Aga v. State of Punjab and Anr.2, as also the 
principles enunciated by this Court in the decisions in V. 
Venkata Subbarao v. State3 and in Vishnu Dutt Sharma 
v. Daya Sapra4 cannot go in oblivion.  In Noor Aga’s 
case, this Court observed and held that superficially a 
case might have an ugly look and thereby, prima facie, 
shaking the conscious of any court.  But it is well settled 
that suspicion, however high it might be, could under no 
circumstances be held to be substitute for legal 
evidence.

3 (2006) 13 SCC 305 
4 (2009) 13 SCC 729 

Page 14 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
14. 
There can be little doubt with respect to the 
position that a Court is bound to appreciate the defence 
evidence in the same manner as it is to appreciate the 
prosecution evidence, in a criminal case.  In V. Venkata 
Subbarao’s case, this Court held that the burden as an 
accused did not have to meet the same standards of 
proof as is required to be met by the prosecution.   In 
Vishnu Dutt Sharma’s case, this Court held that the 
prosecution is bound to prove the commission of the 
offence on the part of the accused beyond any 
reasonable doubt. Certainly, the requirement to 
establish its case beyond reasonable doubt does not 
mean that the degree of proof on the part of the 
prosecution must be one beyond a shadow of doubt (see 
the decision in Iqbal Moosa Patel v. State of Gujarat5). 
15. 
The principle as to what degree of proof is 
required, is stated by Lord Denning in Miller v. 
Minister of Pensions6, thus: - 
“…that degree is well settled.  It need not reach 
certainty, but it must carry a high degree of 
probability.  Proof beyond reasonable doubt 
does not mean proof beyond the shadow of a 
doubt.  The law would fail to protect the 
 
5 (2011) 2 SCC 198 
6 (1947) 2 All ER 372 

Page 15 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to 
deflect the course of justice.  If the evidence is so 
strong against a man as to leave only a remote 
possibility in his favour which can be dismissed 
with sentence, “of course it is possible, but not 
in the least probable” the case is proved beyond 
reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will 
suffice.”  
 
16. 
 The reasons for my remarks, as above, would be 
unravelled by the following critical examination of the 
impugned common judgment and also appreciation of 
evidence, in that regard.   
17. 
The judgment of the trial Court would reveal that 
the finger print test conducted for identification of the 
dead body was accepted and acted upon.  The trial Court 
held in paragraph 59 of its judgment that the finger prints 
of Shama @ Kalya are identical with the finger prints of 
unknown dead body, is acceptable.  “Had Shama @ 
Kalya not been criminal, whose record slips would not 
have been available, there was no chance of identification 
of dead body”, the trial Court further held thus in 
paragraph 101 of its judgment.  However, a bare perusal 
of the impugned common judgment would disclose that 
even while confirming the conviction under Section 304 
part-II read with Section 34, IPC and also the 

Page 16 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
consequently imposed sentence therefor, the High Court 
had reversed the twin foundational findings of the trial 
Court for the conviction under Section 304 part-II read 
with Section 34, IPC.  Furthermore, the High Court 
assigned its own reason for finding the appellants not 
guilty for the offence committed under Section 300, IPC, 
punishable under Section 302, IPC.   It is to be noted that 
the Trial Court despite the absence of medical evidence 
as to the injury of cutting off veins on the legs took that 
the prosecution has succeeded in establishing that the 
deceased Shama @ Kalya had sustained such injuries 
and at the same time, held that the said injuries would not 
attract clause (3) of Section 300, IPC that speaks of 
causing bodily injury which is sufficient in the ordinary 
course of nature to cause death.   Based on such opinion 
and holding that in the circumstances obtained accused 
Nos.1, 2 and 4 should be clothed with the knowledge that 
the injuries which Shama @ Kalya had so sustained were 
likely to cause death, found them guilty for having 
committed the offence falling squarely under Section 304 
part-II with the aid of Section 34, IPC.  As already noted, 
the trial Court did so after accepting the opinion on 
finger print test and the consequent identification of the 
dead body as that of Shama @ Kalya.  

Page 17 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
18. 
The evidence on record would reveal that what was 
traced from Garra Chowky, within the jurisdiction of 
Tirodi Police Station, on 31.12.1995 was an unidentified, 
burnt body.  Taking note of the said position, in 
paragraph 102 of the impugned common judgment the 
High Court held thus: - 
 
“102.  In view of the fact that the dead body was 
beyond identification and recognition, by patent 
identification marks, only sources of identification 
left to the prosecution were:  
[a] 
DNA test 
[b] 
Comparison of finger print marks.” 
 
 
19. 
Upon finding that no DNA test was done and then 
holding that even if it was done it would not have the 
value of a conclusive proof as to the contents thereof, the 
High Court went on to consider the sustainability of the 
finding on the finger print test by the Trial Court.   
Contextually, it is worthy to refer to paragraphs 105 to 
108 of the impugned common judgment.   They read 
thus: - 
 
“105. In so far as the aspect of finger prints is 
concerned, prosecution has made efforts to 
demonstrate that finger prints, subject-matter, 

Page 18 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
match with those of the dissected fingers of 
corpse, and do prove that those are of one and 
the same person. 
 
106. Prosecution has proved that the finger 
prints of the dissected fingers, which were used, 
were of the dead body, subject-matter. 
 
107. The evidence of PW 41 - Sharad Dayaram 
Girhepunje at pages 1471 onwards of the paper-
book, however, fails to positively prove that the 
finger prints, which were used as a basic 
document to be the finger prints of Shyama, 
were not so proved to be that of Shyama taken 
by a particular person with maintenance of due 
record thereof, and the purpose for which those 
were taken by proving those to have been 
recorded in relation to a particular crime. 
 
108. In the result, reliance of the prosecution to 
prove that the dead body, subject-matter, was 
that of Shyama is based on guess work than on 
positive evidence. Result is that unless it is 
proved that the dead body was that of Shyma, 
the evidence in relation to efforts made by the 
accused persons to mutilate the said body and 
thereby destroy the evidence are rendered like 
a hazy picture, and do not constitute proof of 
charge under Section 302 of Indian Penal Code, 
and, therefore, charge to destroy evidence of 
murder is not proved to that extent.” 

Page 19 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
20. 
A scanning of the afore-extracted paragraphs 
would show that the High Court had clearly arrived at the 
conclusion that even if it could take that the prosecution 
had succeeded in proving that the finger prints kept in 
the police station would match with the dissected fingers 
of the corpse, it had failed to establish that the finger 
prints, which were used as basic document to be the 
finger print of Shama and thereby, that the recovered 
dead body was that of deceased Shama.   Evidently, the 
High Court held that the evidence of PW-41, Sharad 
Dayaram Girhepunje failed to prove positively that the 
finger prints that were used as a basic document to be 
the finger prints of Shama, taken by a particular person 
entrusted with the duty of maintenance of due record 
thereof. It is such cumulative consideration that 
constrained the High Court to reverse the conclusion of 
the Trial Court and ultimately to hold that the finding that 
the dead body was that of Shama was based on guess 
work than on positive evidence. The aforesaid 
paragraphs would show that after appreciating the 
evidence, the High Court held that unless it is proved that 
the dead body is that of Shama, the evidence in relation 
to efforts made by the accused persons to mutilate the 
said body and to destroy the evidence would not 

Page 20 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
constitute the proof of charge under Section 302, IPC. In 
short, assigning specific reasons the High Court 
reversed the finding of the trial Court that the opinion on 
the fingerprint test is acceptable and the prosecution 
had thus succeeded in proving the identity of the 
recovered body as that of Shama.  After holding thus, it 
was further held that unless it is proved that the dead 
body was that of Shama, the evidence in relation to 
efforts made by the accused persons to mutilate the said 
body could not be taken as proof for destruction of 
evidence of murder of Shama.  At this juncture, I will 
refer to the other aspect of acquittal (or conviction) for 
the offence under Section 201 read with Section 34, IPC, 
referred to earlier by me as one that also requires 
consideration.    
21. 
In paragraph 77 of the judgement of the trial Court 
it was observed thus: -   
“Whatever be reason, but there is no direct 
evidence in this case, that all the accused No.1 
to 9 had caused disappearance of the dead body 
of deceased Shama @ Kalya by nothing it to 
fire”. 
 
22. 
After making such observation, the trial Court held 
that there was no other alternative except to hold the 

Page 21 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
accused Nos.1, 2 and 4 guilty for causing the 
disappearance of the body by mutilating it and 
accordingly guilty of the offence under Section 201 read 
with Section 34, IPC.  In the above circumstances, the 
observations and findings at paragraph 108 of the 
impugned judgment of the High Court can only be qua 
accused Nos.1, 2 and 4.  
23. 
Now, it is to be noted that on another count, the 
Trial Court held accused Nos.3, 5, 6 and 7 guilty of the 
offence under Section 201, IPC.    In paragraph 85 of the 
judgment of trial Court it was observed and   held: - 
“……A false record came to be prepared about 
escape of Shama @ Kalya. Apart from that even 
the arrest of Shama @ Kalya and taking him for 
the purpose of investigation itself was a false 
preparation of the record and thus false 
information. All the accused No. 1 to 7 seem to 
have been involved in this drama played in the 
night on 24.12.1995 right from showing of arrest 
of Shama @ Kalya. Therefore, so far as offence 
U/s. 201 of IPC is concerned I hold the accused 
No. 3,5 to 7 guilty for giving false information 
which they knew it to be false.” 
  
24. 
The judgement of the trial Court would further 
reveal that on 17.02.1997 when it was brought to notice 
that while typing the final order, conviction in respect of 

Page 22 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
the offences under Sections 201, 218 read with Section 
34, IPC were not typed due to oversight and bona fide 
mistake, a corrigendum of the order of conviction was 
issued on 17.02.1997 on the following lines: - 
“Accused No. 1 to 7 are convicted of the offence 
under Section 201, 218 R/w Section 34 of IPC and 
are sentenced to suffer R.I. for one year and to 
pay a fine of Rs. 1,000/- each in default to suffer 
further S.I. for four months on each count”.  
 
 
25. 
Thus, it can be seen that though on different counts 
the trial Court held accused Nos.1 to 7 guilty under 
Section 201, IPC the High Court acquitted accused 1, 2 
and 4 of the charge under Section 201 read with Section 
34, IPC only in respect of causing disappearance of body 
by mutilating it.  Therefore, the question is whether the 
acquittal of the accused Nos. 1, 2 and 4 under Section 201 
read with Section 34, IPC by the High Court got any 
impact on accused Nos. 2 and 4 as also accused Nos.3 
and 5 to 7 in relation to the other count, referred 
hereinbefore. 
26. 
Now, in the impugned common judgment, the High 
Court after reversing the finding of the trial Court on the 
evidence based on fingerprint test held that the charge 
in relation to the screening of evidence by mutilating the 

Page 23 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
dead body of Shama @ Kalya was not proved but failure 
of prosecution in identification of dead body of Shama 
would not exonerate the accused from the charge of the 
screening evidence and other charges. Thereafter, upon 
considering the evidence on the charge of offence under 
Section 201, IPC read with Section 34, IPC, the High 
Court held in paragraphs 111 – 113 of the impugned 
common judgment thus: - 
“111. In the result, this Court concludes that 
based on facts proved by the prosecution, it has 
succeeded in proving all charges, except the 
proof of destruction of evidence as regards dead 
body. 
 
112. Prosecution has failed to prove offence 
punishable under Section 201 read with Section 
34 
of 
Indian 
Penal 
Code 
for 
causing 
disappearance of evidence by destroying the 
dead body of Shyama, incorporated in sixth part 
of charge framed against accused persons. 
 
113. Based on findings and conclusions 
recorded in para 112, the accused are acquitted 
of those charges.” 
  
27. 
In view of the afore-extracted paragraphs from the 
impugned common judgment of the High Court as also 
what is referred from the judgment of the trial Court, it is 

Page 24 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
evident that the contention of the appellant-convicts that 
there is wholesome acquittal of their conviction under 
Section 201, read with Section 34 IPC cannot be the 
correct position.  As specifically made clear in 
paragraph 112 as extracted above, the acquittal under 
Section 201, IPC was with respect to causing 
disappearance of evidence by destroying the dead body 
of Shyama.  Therefore, the question as to whether the 
appellant-convicts concerned still stand convicted on 
the other count. 
28. 
In the light of the observations and findings in 
paragraphs 105 to 108 and 112 of the impugned common 
judgment, and the reversal thereunder of the aforesaid 
twin foundational findings of the trial Court, the main 
question to be considered is whether any evidence was 
available to hold the appellants guilty under Section 304 
part-II read with Section 34, IPC.  Certainly, the answer 
to the aforementioned question qua Section 201, IPC also 
would depend upon the outcome of its consideration.  
Before continuing with such consideration, it is relevant 
to note that despite such reversal of the findings and 
observations by the High Court which are fatal to the 
case of the prosecution regarding custodial death, 
neither the State nor any relative, who falls within the 

Page 25 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
expression ‘victim’, did not prefer any appeal against the 
impugned common judgment.  
29. 
There can be no doubt that it is imperative, firstly, 
to prove homicidal death of the very person whose death 
was allegedly caused by the accused concerned to hold 
the accused concerned guilty, either under Section 300, 
IPC punishable under Section 302, IPC or under Section 
304, IPC.   In the decision of Harendra Nath Mandal v. 
State of Bihar7, this Court held that before an accused is 
held guilty and punished under first part or second part 
of Section 304, IPC, a death must have been caused by 
the assailant under any of the circumstances mentioned 
in the five exceptions to Section 300, IPC.  I shall not be 
understood to have held that recovery of the dead body 
of the particular person whose death was allegedly 
caused by the accused is always required to sustain a 
charge of murder or that of commission of offence under 
Section 304, IPC. 
30. 
Contextually, it is only apposite to note that the 
expression ‘corpus delicti’ got no reference to corpses.  
Virtually, it means that before seeking to prove that 
accused is the author of the crime concerned, it must be 
 
7 (1993) 2 SCC 435 

Page 26 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
established that the crime charged has been committed.  
In fact, the said Latin expression is used with reference 
to the establishment of the fact that an offence has been 
committed, as opposed to the proof that a given person 
has committed it.  I may hasten to add that, at times, the 
said expression is found to be used in the sense “dead 
body of the victim of alleged homicide".   In the decision 
of Sevaka Perumal & Anr. v. State of Tamil Nadu8, it was 
laid down that it would not be essential to establish 
corpus delicti, but the factum of death of the deceased 
concerned must be established like any other fact.  In the 
decision of Ram Chandra and Ram Bharosey v. State of 
Uttar Pradesh9, it was held that in law, a conviction for an 
offence did not necessarily depend upon the corpus 
delicti, i.e., the dead body, is being found.   However, 
there 
must 
be 
reliable 
evidence, 
direct 
or 
circumstantial, of commission of murder, though corpus 
delicti is not traceable.  In the decision of Mani Kumar 
Thapa v. State of Sikkim10, it was held that in a trial for 
murder it is neither an absolute necessity nor an 
essential ingredient to establish corpus delicti, but the 
 
8  (1991) 3 SCC 471 
9 AIR 1957 SC 381 
10 (2002) 7 SCC 157 

Page 27 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
factum of death of the deceased concerned must be 
established like any other fact.  Furthermore, it was held 
that in some cases it would not be possible to trace or 
recover corpus delicti owing to a number of possibilities 
such as dead body might have been disposed of without 
trace. Taking into account such possibilities it was 
furthermore held that if the recovery of dead body is to 
be held to be mandatory to convict an accused, in many 
cases, the accused would manage to see that the dead 
body is destroyed, which would have afforded the 
accused a complete immunity from being held guilty or 
from being punished.  It was therefore held that what is 
required in law to base a conviction for an offence of 
murder is that there should be reliable and plausible 
evidence, like any other fact, that death was committed 
and it could be proved by direct or circumstantial 
evidence albeit the dead body could not be traced.  
Thus, the law laid down in the aforesaid decisions, which 
was consistently being followed, would reveal that 
conviction of an offence referred above did not depend 
upon whether the dead body is found, if reliable 
evidence, direct or circumstantial, of the commission of 
homicide is established despite the non-tracing of the 
dead body.  Having held thus, I may hasten to add that 

Page 28 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
the same cannot be the position, rather, the position 
would be different, when prosecution itself got a case 
that the dead body was recovered.  Indisputably, it is 
one thing to say that the dead body is not traceable and 
another thing to say and claim that the dead body is 
traced and it is of that person allegedly murdered by the 
accused.  Once the dead body is traced and subjected to 
autopsy and necrotomic and other evidences are 
adduced to bring out the cause of death, failure to prove 
that the dead body is of that very person allegedly done 
to death by the very accused, must have fatal and 
adverse consequence on the prosecution case.  As noted 
earlier, a case that dead body is untraceable and a case 
where it is traced and evidence is adduced in a bid to 
prove the identity of the deceased are different and 
distinct.  In the latter case, upon failure to prove, the 
prosecution cannot be permitted to advance a case that 
the dead body is untraceable.  In the decision of State v. 
Sushil Sharma11, a Division Bench of the Delhi High 
Court held that there would be absolutely no room, in a 
criminal case, for conjectures and surmises and the 
prosecution is supposed to establish its case as is put 
 
11 2007 SCC OnLine Del 255 

Page 29 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
forth by it and if the case is disbelieved on any aspect by 
the Court, then the Court could not make out a new case 
on its own for the prosecution.  I am in full agreement 
with the law thus laid.     
31. 
In the case on hand, evidently the very case of the 
prosecution is that the body recovered from forest area 
within jurisdiction of Tirodi Police Station is that of the 
deceased Shama @ Kalya, and it is to prove the same that 
the fingerprint test was conducted and relied on.  I have 
already found that though trial Court accepted and acted 
upon the opinion of the fingerprint test and that the said 
finding was reversed by the High Court.  In categoric 
terms, the High Court held that the reliance of 
prosecution to prove that the dead body, subject matter, 
was that of Shama is based on guess work than on 
positive evidence.  I have already taken note of the fact 
that the trial Court after accepting the opinion of the 
fingerprint test held that but for the availability of record 
slips, Shama @ Kalya being a criminal, there would not 
have been any chance of identification of the dead body.  
In such circumstances when once identification of the 
dead body as that of Shama @ Kalya based on fingerprint 
test is reversed by the High Court, in the absence of 
appeal by the State or the victim, it could not be said that 

Page 30 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
the dead body is that of Shama @ Kalya, either for 
holding the appellant-convicts guilty of the offence 
under Section 300, IPC punishable under Section 302, 
IPC, or under Part -I / Part-II of Section 304, IPC.   
32. 
Though, I have already held that upon failure to 
prove the case put forth that the recovered dead body is 
that of the person allegedly murdered by the accused, 
the prosecution cannot be permitted to raise a 
contention that the dead body is not traceable or that in 
such eventuality the Court also cannot make out a new 
case on its own for the prosecution, I think it only proper 
to proceed with further consideration of the present 
case.   
33. 
In the contextual situation, it is also relevant to refer 
to the decision of this Court in State of Karnataka v. M.V. 
Mahesh12.  Even in the absence of corpus delicti, it is 
possible to establish in an appropriate case commission 
of murder on appropriate material being made available 
to the court, it was held therein.  Therefore, the question 
is when the opinion on the fingerprint test is eschewed 
from the evidence, what survives to sustain the finding of 
 
12 (2003) 3 SCC 353 

Page 31 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
guilt of appellant-convicts concerned under Section 304, 
Part-II, IPC, in the case on hand. 
34. 
The case on hand allegedly, being a case of 
custodial death, as an abundant caution, I have taken 
pain to see whether any other material and acceptable 
evidence was adduced by the prosecution to establish 
homicide of Shama @ Kalya by the appellant-convicts 
during his illegal custody.  It is a fact that none of the 
prosecution witnesses had deposed to the effect that 
he/she had seen the veins of legs of Shama @ Kalya in a 
cut off state or that he/she had seen his dead body 
anywhere in Gondia City Police Station including in any 
part of the Detective Branch Room.   True that PW-1 and 
PW-16 have spoken to have seen Shama being beaten 
while in police custody.   Hence, in the absence of any 
such specific statement from any of the prosecution 
witnesses while being examined and in the absence of 
any medical evidence in that regard, the question is how 
the Trial Court and the High Court arrived at the 
conclusion that veins of legs of Shama @ Kalya were cut 
off and such injuries, though not sufficient in the ordinary 
course of nature to cause death, ultimately caused his 
death while being in custody.  

Page 32 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
35. 
In the contextual situation, it is relevant to deal 
further with the oral testimonies of the witnesses.  PW-1, 
Amrutabai, the wife of Shama @ Kalya would depose that 
Shama was involved in several theft cases and used to be 
in jail frequently.  She would also depose that he had 
plans to dispose of property at Kalamana.  PW-16, who is 
the mother-in-law of Shama @ Kalya had also deposed in 
regard to his proposal to dispose of property at 
Kalamana. The relevance of their evidence in regard to 
disposal of Kalmana property will be looked into later, in 
another context.   Evidence of PW-1, Amrutabai would 
reveal that while being examined-in-chief, she deposed 
that on 18.12.1995 she was tortured in a room by some of 
the accused and Shama was also brought to the said 
room later and then she saw him bleeding from his legs.  
She would further depose that on being enquired Shama 
would say that police had cut the veins of his leg and he 
might not survive and therefore, she would have to look 
after their children.  She would further depose that on 
22.12.1995, she found swelling on his feet and also 
bleeding from it.   One Compounder, Soni was brought 
to treat them.  According to her, Shama was treated for 5 
days and though she had been there for 5 days since 
17.12.1995, she was given treatment only for a day.   She 

Page 33 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
also deposed that when she went to speak to Shama she 
found his eyes and mouth were shut and he did not speak 
to her.  According to her, she told the accused that the 
police had killed him to which they replied that he was 
only pretending.  She would further depose that at about 
5 or 6 pm she was released and, thereafter, on 25.12.1995 
she, along with PW-16, her children, one Anil and her 
brother-in-law, went to Detective Branch Office of the 
police station and when enquired about Shama she was 
told that he had escaped from police custody. 
36. 
It is to be noted that in the context of the oral 
testimony of PW-1, as above, she was confronted with 
her Ext. 130 statement as also Ext.131, which was her 
statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short “Cr.PC.”) for the 
purpose of contradicting her.   In the light of the decision 
of this Court in Utpal Das & Anr. v. State of West Bengal13 
there can be no doubt that a statement recorded under 
Section 164, Cr.PC., can also be used like a statement 
under Section 161, Cr.PC, to cross-examine the maker of 
it and to contradict him.  Evidently, serious omissions 
were brought out by confronting PW-1 with such 
 
13 (2010) 6 SCC 493 

Page 34 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
statements, with respect to the alleged disclosure of 
Shama that the accused had cut off veins of his leg and 
statement that he would not survive and, therefore, she 
should look after the children.  Though in the chief 
examination she deposed to have been told as above by 
Shama while confronting with Ext. 131 they were brought 
as omissions which PW-1 could not explain.  So also, it is 
evident on being confronted with Ext.130, her statement 
in Court that after being beaten Shama shut off his eyes 
and mouth and did not speak to her, was brought as 
omissions.  A perusal of Section 145 of the Evidence Act, 
1872 would reveal that a witness could be cross-
examined as to previous statement in writing only in 
respect of a fact relevant to the matter(s) in question, for 
the purpose of contradicting him in the manner provided 
therein.  Omissions amounting to contradiction that 
militate against the core of the prosecution case alone is 
material as in such circumstances it would have a 
bearing on the credibility of the witness concerned.  In 
the decision in Shri Gopal & Anr. v. Subhash & Ors.14, 
this Court held that omission to state a fact amounts to 
contradiction.  In the light of the matters in question the 
 
14 (2004) 13 SCC 174 

Page 35 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
position that the aforementioned omissions are serious 
and amounting to contradictions cannot be disputed in 
view of the fact that they militate against the core of the 
prosecution case.  In this context it is to be noted that 
they are crucial points of facts brought out by the 
prosecution through the testimony of PW-1 Amrutabai in 
Court.  Injury due to cutting off the veins of the legs of 
Shama @ Kalya was taken as an injury that ultimately 
caused his death, though, it was held not sufficient in the 
ordinary course of nature to cause death.  The judgment 
of the trial Court would further show that the statement 
said to have been made by Shama to PW-1, during the 
cross-examination, that owing to such cutting of vein he 
might not survive and she would have to take care of the 
children, was taken as dying declaration by the trial 
Court.  Statement of PW-1 in the Court that on 22.12.1995 
after they were beaten up, she went to speak to Shama 
and then, his eyes and mouth were shut and he did not 
speak, were also given due weight as a fact ignoring that 
they were brought as serious omissions.  Thus, the 
circumstances reveal that in respect of matters in 
question involved in the case those omissions brought 
out during cross-examination of    PW-1 are material and 
serious enough to tantamount to contradictions militating 

Page 36 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
against the core of the prosecution case and, therefore, 
got a bearing on the credibility of the witness.  Some of 
the other witnesses referred to hereinbefore mentioned 
only about the bleeding injuries seen on Shama, and at 
any rate none of them spoke about seeing injury of 
cutting off veins on his legs much less about seeing the 
accused persons cutting off the veins.  I have already 
taken note of the fact that there is no medical evidence 
revealing that the veins of legs of Shama were cut off.  
That apart, it is to be noted that the postmortem report 
conducted on the un-identified body also would not 
reveal noting of any antemortem injuries much less 
cutting of veins on the legs. 
37. 
In the said circumstances taking note of the facts 
that dead body traced out and subjected to postmortem 
was not identified to be that of Shama, that no 
antemortem injuries were found on the dead body 
coupled with the omissions amounting to contradiction 
that militates against the core of the prosecution case, 
there was no justification for the trial Court to arrive at a 
conclusion that the veins of legs of Shama were cut off 
and the said bleeding injury ultimately caused his death.  
These aspects were not at all considered by the High 
Court under the impugned common judgment. 

Page 37 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
38. 
Paragraph 18 of the judgment, would reveal that it 
was the further case of the prosecution that accused 
persons hatched a plan and conspiracy and made PW-8 
Dipak Lokhande disguised as Shama @ Kalya and made 
him to sit in a vehicle along with them.  According to the 
prosecution after the vehicle had taken and turned near 
Agrasen Bhavan, Dipak Lokhande was asked to jump 
from vehicle and no sooner the vehicle was slowed down 
near the speed-breaker, Dipak Lokhande obliged to the 
request and then the accused persons started shouting 
that Shama @ Kalya escaped from the custody.  It is also 
the case of the prosecution that to suit a case of escape of 
Shama @ Kalya from custody certain documents were 
created rather some entries were made in the station 
diary records.  Thus, prosecution put forth such a case to 
establish that the accused persons had staged such a 
drama in a bid to create a belief that Shama @ Kalya 
escaped from their custody.  Dipak Lokhande who was 
examined by the prosecution as PW-8, evidently did not 
support the case of the prosecution.  It is to be noted that 
his evidence was appreciated by the Trial Court in 
paragraph 48 of its judgment and observed that it is not 
expected from such a stock panch and a regular 
informant who is on the parole of police to go against 

Page 38 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
local police.  It is also a fact that though a charge under 
Section 202, IPC was framed against accused Nos. 1, 2 
and 4 as well they were not found guilty on the said 
charge.  The High Court instead of taking into account 
the fact that it was a case put forth by the prosecution and 
to prove the same PW-8 was examined and he turned 
hostile, observed that a specific case of Shama’s escape 
from custody was raised by the defence.  The High Court 
went on to observe that having taken such a specific 
defence the appellants failed to establish the same and 
therefore, it must have its consequences.  In other words, 
it was held that proving the same was the burden of the 
appellants. 
In 
the 
contextual 
situation, 
another 
incongruency occurred in the consideration of the 
evidence by the Trial Court and the High Court is also 
noteworthy.  As noticed hereinbefore, it is the case of the 
prosecution that such a drama was staged by the 
accused to show that Shama had escaped from their 
custody.  As noticed earlier, Dipak Lokhande who was 
examined by the prosecution to prove the same did not 
support the case of prosecution.  It is in this context that 
an Order dated 07.01.1996 passed by Railway Court, 
JMFC, Railway, Raipur in C.No.12/96 of S.E. Railway 
under Section 137/174 of Railways Act, 1989, the 

Page 39 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
certified copy of which was produced by the accused No. 
1 assumes relevance.  The appreciation of the same by 
the Trial Court in paragraph 54 of its judgment, is 
required be extracted, to know the nature of 
appreciation made by the Trial Court.  It reads thus: - 
“……It is defence of accused No. 1 that a person 
by name Shama was convicted by Railway 
Court. Raipur on 7.1.96 for traveling without 
ticket.  He has produced the certified copy of the 
order of Railway Court. Raipur.  This was an 
attempt to show that Shama was alive.  
Considering the circumstances and conduct of 
the policemen.  It appears that the certified copy 
which is produced to show that Shama was 
convicted on 7.1.96 cannot be pertaining to 
Shama @ Kalya.  It was an attempt to circumvent 
the case of prosecution.  It was known to accused 
persons that offence was to be registered 
against them.  The certified copy discloses that 
Shama was found while traveling between 
Gondia to Raipur without ticket.  As per 
practices of Railway he was asked to pay Rs. 50/- 
but it is said that he denied and therefore, he 
was prosecuted.  We have to see firstly Shama 
was dreadful criminal who will not be so easily 
caught by Railway police accordingly if he 
would have been by chance caught, he will 
choose to pay Rs. 50/- From the certified copy it 
appears that he was convicted on admission and 

Page 40 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 200/- Defence has 
not arranged to examine the railway employee 
who has charged sheeted the alleged Shama @ 
Kalya.  This record produced by defence cannot 
be taken to be pertaining to Shama @ Kalya the 
record seems to have been prepared so that 
there should be some record about Shama @ 
Kalya.  The record seems to have been prepared 
so that there should be some record about 
Shama @ Kalya being alive.  It is difficult to 
believe that Shama would never meet his 
children wife and mother.  There was no reasons 
for Shama to avoid his arrest, because he was 
convicted in 11 Criminal cases.  For this reason, 
I have no hesitation to reject the theory of 
defence about Shama @ Kalya having fled away 
from the custody of Police.”         
          
39. 
Despite such consideration by the Trial Court on 
the aforesaid evidence based on suppositions and 
conjectures, the High Court in the impugned judgment 
observed that the defence, for reasons best known and 
best advice they must have been rendered chosen to be 
happy and satisfied with the defence of cross-
examination and they did not deem it appropriate to take 
recourse to any defence whatsoever. 

Page 41 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
40. 
The legally and factually incorrect approach of the 
High Court is evident from paragraphs 61 and 62 of the 
impugned common judgment.  They read thus: - 
“61. For the accused persons at least to create 
a doubt in the evidence brought by the 
prosecution in the mind of the Court, and some 
belief  in favour of accused, that the accused 
have some defence and the prosecution story is 
debatable, defence could have chosen to lead 
any evidence including their own testimonies 
of denial, stating that on particular days and 
dates, on which the prosecution witnesses  
claim to have been brought to the Detective 
Branch Room of the Police Station, were not at 
all also called or detained or kept under the 
domain of police or were ill-treated. 
 
62. The defence has, for the reasons best 
known and best advice they must have been 
rendered, chosen to be happy and satisfied 
with the device of cross-examination.  They did 
not deem it appropriate to take recourse to any 
defence evidence, whatsoever.” 
 
 
41. 
Thus, it is evident that the High Court failed even to 
take note of the fact that such a document was available 
before the trial Court, but the trial Court appreciated the 
same only in the manner mentioned above.  This 
assumes relevance in the context that the prosecution 

Page 42 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
itself had put forth the case of escape from custody by 
Shama @ Kalya, but described it as a drama staged by 
the defence to create a belief that Shama @ Kalya was 
escaped from the custody.  When the witness examined 
to prove the same turned hostile and the defence 
evidence suggesting probabilising such an escape was 
produced, it was incumbent on the part of the court(s) to 
consider the same, in accordance with law.  In this 
context, it is to be noted that the very judgment of the 
trial Court itself would reveal that what was produced by 
the first accused was certified copy of an order in a 
summary trial whereunder a person by name Shama @ 
Kaloo s/o Nanu, shown to be a resident of Kalamana was 
convicted for travelling ticketless in a train between 
Gondia to Raipur.  I have already noted earlier that PW-
1 and PW-16 deposed that Shama @ Kalya wanted to 
dispose of property at Kalamana.  The way in which it was 
appreciated 
by 
the 
trial 
Court, 
as 
extracted 
hereinbefore, would reveal that the said piece of 
evidence was brushed aside by the trial Court making its 
own suppositions and presumptions.  There can be little 
doubt with respect to the position that a Court is not 
justified in deciding a case upon its own suspicions or 
suppositions after discarding the evidence adduced by 

Page 43 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
the parties and that defence evidence is also to be 
appreciated in the same manner as it is to appreciate the 
prosecution evidence, but with the understanding that in 
the case of accused the standard of proof required is only 
preponderance of probabilities. 
42. 
In the context of the reasoning of the High Court 
that the defence had failed to prove its specific plea of 
escape, it is only appropriate to consider the aforesaid 
factual and legal position.  I have already noted that the 
prosecution has put forth a case that the accused had 
staged a drama to create evidence that Shama @ Kalya 
had escaped from police custody and to prove the same, 
prosecution got examined PWs, but he turned hostile 
and did not support the prosecution.  Ignoring the 
evidence from the defence, which was discussed in 
detail though rejected by the Trial Court, the High Court 
held that the defence did not adduce any evidence, but 
had chosen to be happy and satisfied with the device of 
cross-examination and further held that for the failure to 
prove the specific plea the accused have to suffer the 
consequence.  Before considering evidence adduced by 
defence, elaborately discussed by the Trial Court, I will 
consider certain established principles of criminal law.  
Indisputably, it is an established principle of criminal 

Page 44 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
law that it is the burden of the prosecution to establish 
the guilt of the accused.  This Court in the decision in 
Paramjeet Singh v. State of Uttarakhand15 held in 
unambiguous terms that the burden of proof squarely 
rests upon the prosecution and further that the more 
serious is the crime, the stricter is the proof required.   
43. 
In view of the afore-mentioned reasoning given by 
the High Court it is also relevant to refer the decision of 
this Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of 
Maharashtra16.  This Court held that the prosecution 
must stand or fall on its own legs and it could not derive 
any strength from the weakness of the defence.  
Furthermore, it was held that the weakness of the 
defence could only be called as additional link to aid the 
prosecution and that it is not the law that where there is 
any infirmity or lacuna in the prosecution case, the same 
could be cured or supplied by a false defence or plea 
which is not accepted by a court.  It is also worthy to refer 
to the decision of this Court in V. Venkata Subharao’s 
case (supra).  The burden on accused did not have to 
meet the same standard of proof as is required to be 
made by the prosecution, it was held therein.  There can 
 
15 (2010) 10 SCC 439 
16 [AIR 1984 SC 1622] 

Page 45 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
be no doubt with the position that unlike the duty cast on 
the prosecution where proof has got to be beyond 
reasonable doubt, in the case of accused, he got to 
establish through a preponderance of probabilities that 
the evidence produced is acceptable to the court.  I have 
already referred to and extracted the relevant 
paragraph in the judgment of the trial Court dealing with 
the certified copy of the order dated 07.01.1996 of the 
Railway Court, Raipur convicting one Shama, S/o Nanu 
residing at Kalamna Nagar for travelling in a train 
between Gondia to Raipur, ticketless. Evidently, the 
afore-extracted paragraph from the judgment of the trial 
Court would reveal that the said piece of evidence of 
defence was never put to test whether it satisfies the 
standard of preponderance of probabilities, but was 
declined on consideration based on suppositions, 
surmises and conjectures.  Evidently, being a certified 
copy of an order passed by a Court viz., the Railway 
Court, Raipur the trial Court could not have declined to 
accept its existence in view of Section 43 of the Evidence 
Act. 
44. 
In terms of the combined reading of Sections 43 
and 79 of the Evidence Act, the trial Court could not have 
declined to accept the existence of the order dated 

Page 46 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
07.01.1996 of Railway Court, Raipur.  Since the existence 
of the said order dated 07.01.1996 cannot be said to be 
not a relevant fact or fact in issue, in view of the 
circumstances obtained in the case, upon its production, 
its evidentiary value should have been considered by 
applying degree of preponderance of probability.  In 
this context, it is only relevant to refer to following 
relevant extract from paragraph 24 of the decision of this 
Court in Dr. N.G. Dastane v. Mrs. S. Dastane17:-  
“24…  The belief regarding the existence of a 
fact may thus be founded on a balance of 
probabilities. A prudent man faced with 
conflicting probabilities concerning a fact-
situation will act on the supposition that the fact 
exists, if on weighing the various probabilities 
he finds that the preponderance is in favour of 
the existence of the particular fact. As a prudent 
man, so the Court applies this test for finding 
whether a fact in issue can be said to be proved. 
The first step in this process is to fix the 
probabilities, the second to weigh them, though 
the two may often intermingle. The impossible is 
weeded out at the first stage, the improbable at 
the 
second. 
Within 
the wide 
range 
of 
probabilities the Court has often a difficult 
choice to make but it is this choice which 
 
17 [(1975) 2 SCC 326] 

Page 47 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
ultimately 
determines 
where 
the 
preponderance of probabilities lies…” 
 
45. 
While considering the identity of the accused who 
stood convicted under the said order dated 07.01.1996 it 
is relevant to note the initial observation of the trial Court 
at paragraph 54 of its judgment.  At the risk of repetition, 
it is referred to hereunder thus: - 
“The certified copy disclose that Shama was 
found while travelling between Gondia to 
Raipur without ticket.” 
 
 
46. 
In this context, it is to be noted that neither the trial 
Court nor the High Court arrived at a specific finding that 
the order dated 07.01.1996 of the Railway Court, Raipur, 
was not in existence or that it pertains to the conviction 
of a different person.  How can such an order be ignored 
by stating that being a dreadful criminal he would not 
have been caught easily or even if caught he would have 
avoided arrest and conviction by depositing a fine of Rs. 
50/-.  It is in this context that the further case of the 
prosecution, that to create an impression that Shama @ 
Kalya had escaped from police custody and the accused 
had staged a drama, has to be looked into.  According to 
the prosecution, in that regard one Dipak Lokhande was 

Page 48 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
made to disguise as Shama @ Kalya and made to jump 
from a police vehicle by the accused.  The evidence 
would reveal that though prosecution itself had 
examined the said Dipak Lokhande, a police official to 
prove the said case, but he turned hostile and did not 
support the prosecution case.  It is in this context that the 
decision of this Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda’s 
case (supra) holding that it is not the law that where there 
is any infirmity or lacuna in the prosecution case, the 
same could be cured or supplied by a false defence or 
plea which is not accepted by a court, assumes 
relevance.  In such circumstances, the order dated 
07.01.1996 mentioned above only probabilise the case 
of defence.  It is in the aforesaid context that the failure 
of the prosecution to prove that Shama’s homicidal death 
had occurred in Detective Branch room of Gondia police 
station has to be viewed.  It is relevant to note that the 
prosecution had examined one Gopal Dinaji Bansod as 
PW 11 to prove disposal of dead body by police.  The 
impugned judgment itself would reveal that he was 
declared hostile and despite being cross-examined on 
behalf of the prosecution nothing relevant could be 
elicited.  It is also to be noted that both the trial Court and 
the High Court failed to appreciate the evidence of PW-

Page 49 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
38, who was a superior officer of the accused and spoke 
about not only certain entries made in the case diary with 
respect to the escape of Kalya and a report on the said 
incident but also of the fact he came to know that one 
person by Shama was arrested at Raipur for travelling 
without ticket.  These aspects also were not taken into 
account by the trial Court as also the High Court.   
47. 
To sum up, it is not inappropriate to extract 
paragraph 110 of the impugned common judgment 
which reveal the principle adopted by the High Court in 
appreciating the evidence in the case on hand and it 
reads thus: - 
“110.  In so far as the aspect of burden of the 
prosecution and duty of defence in regard to 
these points is concerned, the prosecution 
evidence rises to the level as expected for proof 
of facts, and as discussed earlier in this 
Judgment, the accused persons have failed in 
discharge of their duty of rebuttal which rests on 
them in an unqualified manner and the degree. 
 
48. 
Thus, paragraphs 61, 62 and 110 of the impugned 
common judgment would reveal that it is the wrong 
application of the principle of appreciating the evidence 
in criminal cases that ultimately resulted in the 
conclusions and findings compelling the High Court to 

Page 50 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
confirm the judgment of the trial Court except to the limit 
referred above.  Therefore, the appeals except Crl. 
Appeal No. 1614/2012 which stood abated owing to the 
death of the sole appellant, must succeed to the following 
extent. 
49. 
In the absence of evidence regarding homicidal 
death of Shama @ Kalya in Gondia City Police Station 
coupled with the defence evidence, which could stand 
the test of preponderance of probabilities and the other 
circumstances favourable to the accused emerging from 
the other circumstances and failure of the prosecution to 
establish the case put forth by it.  Appellants in Crl. 
Appeal No.1617 of 2012 viz., Accused No. 2 (Ravindra) 
and Accused No. 4 (Hans Raj) are entitled to be acquitted 
for commission of offence under Section 304 Part II read 
with Section 34, IPC, granting the benefit of doubt.  There 
is absolute absence of medical and oral evidence to find 
that the prosecution had succeeded in proving that 
Shama @ Kalya being in custody sustained any ‘grievous 
hurt’ or sustained a kind of hurt, falling in one or the other 
of the eight kinds of hurt (firstly to eighthly given under 
Section 320, IPC).  This is because I have already 
declined the finding that Shama @ Kalya had sustained 
the injury of cutting of veins of his legs.  In such 

Page 51 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
circumstances, the conviction of accused Nos. 2 
(Ravindra), No. 3 (Manohar), No. 4 (Hans Raj) and No. 5 
(Vishnu) under Section 331 read with Section 34, IPC 
cannot be sustained. 
50. 
In view of confirmation of the finding on custodial 
torture their conviction and consequential sentence 
under Section 330, 348 and 387 read with Section 34, IPC 
is to be confirmed.  Since the conviction under Section 
330 covers Section 323, IPC no separate sentence for 
voluntary causing hurt is to be imposed. 
51. 
In view of the conclusions and finding in respect of 
the offence under Section 304-Part II read with Section 34, 
IPC, and the consequential acquittal of the convicts 
concerned granting benefit of doubt the convicts under 
the other offences are also entitled to get benefit of 
doubt, as those offences have relation with the main 
crime.  Consequently, conviction based on finding guilt 
under Section 201, 202, 203 and 218 read with Section 34, 
on appellants-convicts concerned are also liable to be 
set aside. 
52. 
The above discussion and conclusion would 
inevitably invite interference with the conviction of the 
appellant-convicts under Section 201, IPC read with 
Section 34, IPC, on all other grounds than for causing 

Page 52 of 53 
Criminal Appeal Nos.1614-1618 of 2012 
disappearance of evidence by destroying the dead body 
of Shama @ Kalya mentioned in paragraph 112 of the 
impugned common judgment of the High Court. 
53. 
In the result, I dispose of all the appeals as under: - 
I. 
Crl. Appeal No.1614 of 2012 stands abated. 
II. 
Crl. Appeal Nos.1615, 1616, 1617 & 1618 of 2012 
are partly allowed and the common judgment 
dated 12.07.2011 of the Nagpur Bench of the 
Bombay High Court stands set aside except to the 
extent whereunder appellants in Crl. Appeal 
No.1617 of 2012 viz., Ravindra (A2) and, Hans Raj 
(A4), appellant in Crl. Appeal No.1618 of 2012 
viz., Manohar (A3) and, appellant in Crl. Appeal 
No. 1616 of 2012 viz., Vishnu (A5) are convicted 
under Sections 330, 348 and 387, IPC, and 
sentenced to undergo one year of rigorous 
imprisonment and a fine of Rs.1,000/- each and in 
default to suffer simple imprisonment for four 
months on each count. Accordingly, all the 
appellant-convicts are acquitted of all the other 
offences for which each of them was convicted 
and sentenced.  In view of this judgment further 
action is required only in respect of A2 to A5 viz., 
appellants in Crl. Appeal Nos. 1617 of 2012, 1618 

Page 53 of 53

of 2012 and, 1616 of 2012, that too in case any 
sentence 
remains 
unserved 
in

of 
confirmation of conviction and sentence under 
Sections 330, 348 and 387 read with Section 34,

CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL Nos. 1614-1618 of 2012 
Manik and others
 
 
… Appellants
Versus
The State of Maharashtra
         … Respondents
J U D G M E N T
SANJAY KUMAR, J
1.
Having perused the erudite judgment authored by my learned
brother, Justice C.T. Ravikumar, I find myself unable to subscribe to some
of the views and conclusions noted therein. Hence, this differing opinion.  
2.
At the outset, though my learned brother has prefaced his verdict by
stating that Criminal Appeal No. 1614 of 2012 filed by Manik, s/o Sitaram
Jibhkate, stands abated as he died on 06.03.2022, I do not find anything
on record to support and substantiate this statement. I, therefore, proceed
on  the  assumption  that  this  appeal  also  remains  alive  for  active
consideration, along with the other four appeals. 
1

3.
A crucial aspect to be kept in mind while considering these
cases is that all the appellants are members of the police force and the
allegation  against  them  is  of  misuse  and  abuse  of  their  powers,  in
resorting to custodial torture of Shama @ Kalya, s/o Nanu Ukey, and
tampering with evidence. This ultimately resulted in registration of Crime
No. 315 of 1995 for offences punishable under Sections 302, 330, 331,
342, 343, 348, 354, 385, 387, 201, 202, 193 and 218, all read with Section
34, of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). The appellants in these appeals
are Accused Nos. 1 to 7. Sudhir, s/o Rambhan Kayarkar, and Ganesh, s/o
Raghuji Turkar, Accused Nos. 8 and 9, were acquitted by the Trial Court of
charges under Sections 201 and 202 IPC, read with Section 34 IPC, and
the same attained finality. 
4.
 
Details of the conviction and sentencing of Accused Nos. 2 to 7
having been set out at length by my learned brother, there is no need to
replicate the same except to the extent of adding that Accused No. 1,
Manik,  the  appellant  in  Criminal  Appeal No.  1614  of  2012,  was  also
convicted by the Trial Court for offences punishable under Section 304
Part II, 330, 331, 348, 387, 201 and 218 IPC, all read with Section 34 IPC,
and  he  stood  acquitted,  along  with  the  other  accused,  of  offences
punishable under Sections 302 and 354 IPC, both read with Section 34
2

IPC. Thereafter, in appeal, the High Court held that the prosecution had
failed to prove the offence punishable under Section 201 IPC, read with
Section 34 IPC, in so far as it related to causing disappearance of the
body of Shama and all the appellants stood absolved of the same. 
5.
 
It may be noted that Vishwanath and Dilip, Accused Nos. 6 and
7, who jointly filed Criminal Appeal No. 1615 of 2012, already served out
their sentence and were released from prison. This aspect was noted by
this Court on 05.10.2012, while granting leave in these five cases. Further,
it was noted that Manohar, Accused No. 3, had undergone imprisonment
for about 1 year and 10 months out of the sentence of 3 years, while
Vishnu, Accused No. 5, had completed about 1 year imprisonment out of a
similar sentence of 3 years. As regards Manik, Ravindra and Hansraj,
Accused Nos. 1, 2 and 4, it was noted that they had undergone only 2
years out of the sentence of 7 years imprisonment. In such circumstances,
bail was granted only to Manohar and Vishnu, Accused Nos. 3 and 5, and
not to the other three accused/appellants. It was only on 16.02.2015, that
these three accused/appellants were also granted bail, taking note of the
fact that they had completed approximately 5 years in jail. 
6.
 
Ergo,  at  this  stage,  we  are  concerned  mainly  with  Manik,
Accused  No.  1;  Ravindra,  Accused  No.  2;  Manohar,  Accused  No.  3;
3

Hansraj, Accused No. 4 and Vishnu, Accused No. 5. As the State has not
chosen to approach this Court against the dismissal of its appeal by the
High Court, which was filed in the context of the acquittal of the accused
under Section 302 IPC, read with Section 34 IPC, that aspect stands
settled. This failure on the part of the State is, in itself, a cause for concern
as this was a case of police brutality and use of third-degree methods,
which ought to have prompted the State to take a more rigorous stand so
as to set an example and instill discipline in its police machinery. However,
the State of Maharashtra did not deem it appropriate to do so. Be that as it
may. 
7.
Sufficient  evidence  having  been  adduced  before  the  Trial  Court,
which found favour with the High Court also, my learned brother has
confirmed that custodial torture of Shama stands duly proved. As pointed
out by this Court in  State of U.P. vs. Ram Sagar Yadav and others1:
“Police officers alone, and none else, can give evidence as regards the
circumstances in which a person in their custody comes to receive injuries
while in their custody. Bound by ties of a kind of brotherhood, they often
prefer to remain silent in such situations and when they choose to speak,
they put their own gloss upon facts and pervert the truth. The result is that,
persons on whom atrocities are perpetuated by the police in the sanctum
1 
(1985) 1 SCC 552
4

sanctorum of the police station, are left without any evidence to prove who
the offenders are”. 
8.
In  Bhagwan Singh and another vs. State of Punjab2, this Court
observed: “If a person is in police custody, then what has happened to him
is peculiarly within the knowledge of the police officials who have taken
him  into  custody.  When  the  other  evidence  is  convincing  enough  to
establish that the deceased died because of the injuries inflicted by the
accused, the circumstances would only lead to an irresistible inference
that the police personnel who caused his death must also have caused
disappearance of the body”. 
9.
Given this settled legal position, it would suffice at this stage to note
that several witnesses from within the police department, such as, Dilip
Madhuprasad  Sawwalakhe  (PW-20),  Shalikram  Sarasram  Nimkar
(PW-23), Sumanbai (PW-22), and Dayaram Bakaram Sonkusare (PW-19),
and independent witnesses, such as, Tejlal Karulal Pachbhaye (PW-10)
and Kuwarlal Buddusao Dohare (PW-9), the staff from Hotel Anand at
Balaghat,  where  the  appellants  kept  Shama  overnight,  confirmed  that
Shama was injured and bleeding. His wife, Amrutabai (PW-1), stated that
when she saw Shama in the police station on 18.12.1995, he was bleeding
from both legs and he told her that the police had cut the veins in his legs.
2 
(1992) 3 SCC 249
5

Sureshkumar Kharagchand Soni (PW-3), the compounder who treated
Shama while he was in police custody, turned hostile but the fact remains
that his testimony, for what it is worth, also confirms the injured state of
Shama,  consequent to the  third-degree methods used on  him by the
appellants. In such circumstances, it can be safely surmised that Shama
was in the illegal custody of the appellants since 16.12.1995, at the very
least, and suffered prolonged third-degree treatment till 24.12.1995. That
being so, it is very difficult to believe the story projected by the appellants
that Shama escaped from their custody at about 11:00 PM on 24.12.1995.
It is highly improbable that he would have been in a physical state of
fitness to flee, by jumping from a moving jeep in a crowded residential
area, and evade the police. 
10.
Significantly, Shalikram Nimkar (PW-23), being a member of the
police force, confirmed in his deposition before the Trial Court that the
entry in the police record about the escape of Shama was false. The facts
narrated  by  him  were  recorded  by  the  Trial  Court  in  para  48  of  its
judgment.  He  stated  that  he  was  attending  to  the  Station  Diary  on
24.12.1995 when Manik, Accused No. 1, approached and requested him
to make an entry that Shama was reported to have been seen in the
railway yard. PW-23 stated that he inquired with Manik as to why such an
6

entry should be recorded when Shama was in police custody. PW-23
admitted that this entry was wrong but, as Manik was his superior, he had
to oblige him. 
11.
 
‘Life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient
premises’ 3. This art would be all the more essential in the repertoire of a
Judge, who may be presented with incomplete and, sometimes, incorrect
information, while adjudicating a case. Appearances can be manipulated
and  may  be  completely  deceptive,  by  deliberate  design.  It  would  be
gullible  for  a  Court  to  accept  appearances  at  face  value,  however
unconvincing they may be, and play into the hands of those who seek to
dishonestly  deceive  it.  In  the  present  case,  the  appellants  cleverly
concocted the story of Shama escaping from their custody and created a
record to buttress it. Not content therewith, the appellants also cooked up
what is clearly a fabricated saga of Shama surfacing in Raipur and being
convicted by the Railway Court there, on 07.01.1996, for travelling without
a ticket. Even if it is assumed for a second that the police version of
Shama’s escape is true, it would require another huge leap of faith to
believe that Shama, a fugitive from the law, would have willfully refused to
pay 50/-, while caught travelling ticketless between Gondia and Raipur,
₹
and would have preferred to go before the Railway Court to suffer and

7

document  a  conviction,  whereby  he  had  to  pay  200/-  as  fine.  This
₹
convenient story was apparently devised for the purpose of creating a
record of Shama being alive on that date. 
12.
Significantly,  the  prosecution  did  not  gather  any  further
evidence in relation to this conviction at Raipur. No witness from Raipur
was examined to identify and prove that it was the very same Shama who
had suffered the conviction there. In the absence of clinching proof of
Shama being actually alive, the only possible inference that can be drawn
from his established and prolonged torture by the appellants is that he
would have died while in their custody. No doubt, the High Court, in its
wisdom, chose to disbelieve the fingerprint evidence and did not sustain
the Trial Court’s finding that the body that was exhumed at the behest of
the appellants was that of Shama. At best, the exclusion of this evidence
would  only  mean  that  the  dead  body  of  Shama  was  not  traceable.
However, as rightly pointed out by my learned brother, production of a
dead body to prove a murder is not necessary in the eye of law. ‘Corpus
Delicti’ is  a  Latin  phrase  that  broadly  means  –  ‘body  of  the  crime’.
Generally,  this  principle  has  reference  to  the  requirement  of  the
prosecution proving that the crime has been committed, so as to charge
the delinquent and secure a conviction. 
8

13.
In  Sevaka Perumal and another vs. State of Tamil Nadu4,
this Court observed that it is not an absolute necessity or an essential
ingredient to establish the corpus delicti in a trial for murder, as the factum
of death must be established like any other fact. To base a conviction for
murder,  this  Court  held  that  there  must  be  reliable  and  acceptable
evidence that the offence of murder was committed and it must be proved,
either by direct or circumstantial evidence, even if the dead body is not
traceable.

Merely because the appellants were clever enough to trump up a
story of Shama escaping from their custody and the happenstance of the
exhumed body, recovered at their instance, no longer figuring in the picture
due  to  rejection  of  the  fingerprint  evidence,  it  would  be  improper  to
proceed on the assumption that the law laid down in  Sevaka Perumal
(supra) would not be applicable. Doing so would impel the Court to fall into
the  trap  of  the  ingenious  and  wily  appellants,  who  have  cunningly
concocted and falsified records to escape their just deserts. 
15.
This is the major point of divergence between our views. My learned
brother has acted upon the premise that once the dead body is said to
have been traced and it is, then, not proved to be of that person, it would
be  fatal  to  the  case  of  the  prosecution.  Permitting  this  premise  to

gain acceptance would mean that those in the police organization, who
resort to such nefarious methods, can take this easy way out to ward off a
finding of guilt. When sufficient evidence is available to conclude that
Shama was in no position to escape from the custody of the appellants,
the inevitable corollary that follows is that he died due to their torture while
in their custody.
16.
It is high time that our legal system squarely faces the menace of
police  excesses  and  deals  with  it  by  putting  in  place  an  effective
mechanism to obviate such inhuman practices. Long ago, Prof. Upendra
Baxi had observed: “What is truly striking about India is the lack of respect
for rule of law, not just by the people but those who make and enforce
them” 5.  A few years later, Prof. Srikrishna Deva Rao pointed out that
excessive use of force is a product of the police culture that rationalizes
physical abuse as appropriate punishment for persons who are viewed as
trouble-makers or deviants. He asserted that lack of proper legal restraint
on police powers is one of the main reasons for continuous police abuse
and that torture by the police is violative of the right to life and personal
liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution6.

In the words of Mohammed Ghouse: ‘Torture or killing of a person in
police custody is, to put it mildly, illegal. But the real question is when gold
rusts, what can iron do? Who can police the police? Because of the
system of linkages, the accountability of police to the political process is
purely notional. So, the question arises whether courts can police the
police? It is unfortunate that the State has done little to reform the system
to control such abuse of power by the police by institutionalizing a regime
to detect, prosecute and punish wrongdoers within the police organization.
The recommendation of the National Police Commission for a mandatory
judicial inquiry by a District and Sessions Judge still remains on paper.
Organizational accountability is perhaps the only means of ensuring that
the  rank  and  file  within  the  police  department  respect  and  honour
Constitutional values while discharging their functions and do not abuse
the power that comes with it by resorting to third degree methods within
the secrecy and safety of police lock-up’ 7. 
18.
In fact,  in  Ram  Sagar  Yadav (supra), this  Court  had  suggested
amendment of the law relating to burden of proof in case of custodial
deaths. In response thereto, the Law Commission of India, in its 113th
Report (1985) on ‘Injuries in Police Custody’, recommended insertion of
7 
Mohammed Ghouse, "State lawlessness and Constitution of India: A study of custodial deaths",  
Comparative Constitutional Law 270 (Mahendra P. Singh ed., 1989).
11

Section 114-B in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, so as to reverse the
burden of proof in cases of custodial death onto the police themselves.
Despite decades having passed since then, this recommendation has not
come to fruition.
19.
Irrespective of that step being taken, the fact remains that when
sufficient evidence is adduced to prove custodial torture by the police, it is
then for the police themselves to prove their innocence, be it in a case of
death in police custody or even if such a victim goes missing or vanishes.
Notably, Section 29 of the Indian Police Act, 1861, makes willful breach of
regulations  by  a  policeman  and  causing  of  unwarrantable  personal
violence  to  any  person  in  his  custody,  punishable  with  fine  or
imprisonment. Further, Police Manuals invariably hold those in charge of
police stations responsible for the safe custody of all the prisoners housed
therein.

Deepak  Lokhande  (PW-8)  allegedly  impersonated  Shama  on
24.12.1995 and staged a performance to support the police version that
Shama had escaped from their custody on that night. Neither this parody
nor the record of Shama suffering conviction before the Railway Court at
Raipur can be allowed to dupe this Court, as intended by the guileful
appellants. The appellants have been let off rather lightly by convicting
12

them only under Section 304 Part-II IPC. Their careless disregard for the
value of human life warranted a much more stringent punishment being
visited upon them. In such circumstances, giving in to their duplicitous
stories and permitting them to escape punishment would only add insult to
injury.
21.
I  would,  therefore,  respectfully disagree  with  the  conclusion
drawn by my learned brother that, in the absence of evidence regarding
the homicidal death of Shama @ Kalya, the appellants are entitled to be
acquitted of the charge under Section 304 Part-II IPC read with Section 34
IPC, by granting them the benefit of doubt. On the contrary, I would
maintain the convictions and sentences of the appellants, as confirmed by
the High Court, and dismiss all the appeals.
