of the High Court. The husband is the appellant in 
appeal @ SLP(C) No.4109/2023 and the wife is the 
appellant in appeal @ SLP(C) No.19922/2023. The 
husband is praying for further reduction of the 
maintenance amount and the wife is praying for 
enhancement of the same. For our purpose, the wife 
will be referred to as the ‘appellant’ and the husband 
as the ‘respondent’.  
3. The factual background of the present case is that 
the marriage between the appellant wife and 
respondent husband was solemnised on 15.09.2008 
according to Christian customs. The respondent 
husband had one son from his previous marriage and 
there are no issues from this marriage. As the 
relations between the parties got estranged, on 
19.03.2019, the respondent husband filed a petition 
for divorce being IDOP No.1284 of 2019 under 
Section 10(i) of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 stating 
that the parties have developed incompatibility. He 
alleged cruelty while citing various incidents and 
prayed for divorce.  
4. During the pendency of the divorce petition, the 
appellant wife herein filed an application being I.A 
No.1 of 2019 in IDOP No.1294 of 2019 before the 

SLP(CIVIL) NO.4109 OF 2023

Family Court, Chennai praying for maintenance of 
Rs.2,50,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh and Fifty Thousand 
only) per month along with litigation expenses 
amounting to Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh 
only). The wife claimed that the husband is a 
Cardiologist in MJ Hospital, Cochin and draws a 
salary of Rs.1,50,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and Fifty 
Thousand only) per month. Plus, he has further 
income from a joint venture, by virtue of which he is 
earning a sum of Rs.20,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty 
Lakh only) per month. Further, he is earning rental 
income from his properties in Cochin to the tune of 
Rs.2,73,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh and Seventy Three 
Thousand only) and Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty 
Thousand only) from his house in Chennai. 
Additionally, it was claimed that he owns several 
other properties. The wife stated that she has a M.Sc. 
degree in Clothing and Textile and she worked in 
2012 for about ten months. However, the husband 
was against her working and she was forced to leave 
her job.  
5. The Family Court, after evaluating the status, 
standard of living, income and assets of the parties, 
held that Rs.1,75,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and 

SLP(CIVIL) NO.4109 OF 2023 
 
Page 4 of 9 
 
Seventy Five Thousand only) per month would be a 
reasonable amount to be paid to the wife as interim 
maintenance and directed the respondent husband 
herein to pay the same, vide order dated 14.06.2022. 
Aggrieved by this, the respondent husband filed an 
appeal being Civil Miscellaneous Appeal No. 1539 of 
2022 before the Madras High Court challenging the 
same. The Madras High Court partially allowed the 
appeal vide impugned order dated 01.12.2022 by 
reducing the interim maintenance amount to 
Rs.80,000/- (Rupees Eighty Thousand only) per 
month, effective from the date of the petition, i.e. 
03.07.2019 until the disposal of the divorce 
proceedings.  It is this order which has given rise to 
the present appeals. 
6. We have heard the learned counsels for the respective 
parties.  
7. The Family Court upon perusal of records and 
evidence on both sides in order to fix interim 
maintenance, found that it is clear that after 
desertion, the appellant wife had no other place to 
reside and thus, chose to seek shelter with her 
mother-in law, who is aged 93 years. Later on, 
considering the health of the aged mother-in law, the 

SLP(CIVIL) NO.4109 OF 2023 
 
Page 5 of 9 
 
appellant wife started residing with her elder brother. 
Family Court also observed that the respondent 
husband failed to produce his income tax returns. 
However, documents produced by the appellant and 
evidence of both parties in this regard would clearly 
reflect the fact that the respondent is a renowned 
expert in cardiology and has a number of worthful 
properties and is the only legal heir to his father who 
has passed away. His mother is running the age of 
93. He is accruing all the incomes from the properties 
owned by his mother and himself and is also found 
to have been in possession of a school, though it is 
stated to be running in losses. However, the 
respondent did not come forward with any proof to 
this effect.  
8. The Family Court also noted that the respondent 
specifically stated that when the parties were residing 
together, he engaged two maids on 24x7 basis to aid 
them in their domestic work and maintenance and 
the appellant is accustomed to these comforts. The 
Family Court therefore compared the status, 
standard of life, income source, properties, its 
possession, rights and liabilities of the respondent 
and found that the appellant cannot be denied to 

SLP(CIVIL) NO.4109 OF 2023 
 
Page 6 of 9 
 
enjoy the privileges as enjoyed by the respondent. 
Upon this consideration, the Family Court found it 
reasonable to award a sum of Rs.1,75,000/- (Rupees 
One Lakh and Seventy Five Thousand only) as 
interim maintenance to be paid to the appellant by 
the respondent per month from the date of the 
petition being 03.07.2019 till the disposal of the main 
divorce petition being OP 1284 of 2019.  
9. The High Court, on the other hand, while allowing the 
appeal of the husband and modifying the order of the 
Trial Court noted that the Hospital in Kerala agreed 
to pay a sum of Rs.1,25,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and 
Twenty Five Thousand only) per month as salary to 
the respondent husband in 2017. Further, the joint 
venture agreement is of the year 2015 and there is no 
evidence to suggest that the respondent was still 
receiving the said amount from the builder and that 
the sale consideration received by him cannot be 
treated as ‘monthly income’. The Bank statements on 
record pertained to a few months in the years 2017, 
2018 and 2019 and the High Court stated that those 
do not assist them in determining the present income 
of the appellant and did not take those into 

SLP(CIVIL) NO.4109 OF 2023 
 
Page 7 of 9 
 
consideration for the purpose of deciding the 
quantum of maintenance.  
10. The High Court held that the respondent, being a 
Cardiologist, 
earned 
a 
monthly 
income 
of 
Rs.1,25,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and Twenty Five 
Thousand only) is established and that he and his 
mother received a rent of Rs.2,73,301/- (Rupees Two 
Lakh Seventy Three Thousand and Three Hundred 
One only) per month, of which he received only half 
amount. Based on these two considerations, the High 
Court concluded that the appellant wife established 
the respondent’s income to at least Rs.2,50,000/- 
(Rupees Two Lakh and Fifty Thousand only) per 
month. The High Court took note of the fact that the 
appellant sacrificed her employment after the 
marriage and determined that the reasonable 
amount of interim maintenance to be one third of the 
respondent’s income which was Rs.80,000/- (Rupees 
Eighty Thousand only) per month.  
11. We find that the High Court has erred in reducing the 
quantum of maintenance to Rs.80,000/- (Rupees 
Eighty Thousand only) per month. The High Court 
has considered only two sources of income for the 
respondent. Firstly, the sum of Rs.1,25,000/- 

SLP(CIVIL) NO.4109 OF 2023 
 
Page 8 of 9 
 
(Rupees One Lakh and Twenty-Five Thousand only) 
that he earns from working as a Cardiologist at the 
Hospital. Secondly, the rent amount he and his 
mother receive from a property, of which the High 
Court has stated that he receives half the amount 
only. However, the High Court has not dealt with the 
findings of the Family Court wherein the respondent 
is said to own a number of worthful properties and 
the fact that he is the only legal heir of his father. The 
Family Court found that the respondent is accruing 
all the incomes from the properties owned by his 
mother. The High Court has not dealt with the aspect 
of the number of properties owned by the respondent 
and looked at the rental income from one property. 
The Family Court also noted that the respondent was 
found to be in possession of a school and could not 
substantiate his claim that the school was running in 
losses. Therefore, the High Court has overlooked 
certain aspects relating to the income of the 
respondent which were looked at by the Family 
Court. Further, it is also on record that the appellant 
is not working as she sacrificed her employment after 
the marriage. The appellant was accustomed to a 
certain standard of living in her matrimonial home 

SLP(CIVIL) NO.4109 OF 2023 
 
Page 9 of 9 
 
and therefore, during the pendency of the divorce 
petition, is also entitled to enjoy the same amenities 
of life as she would have been entitled to in her 
matrimonial home.  
12. Consequently, we allow the appeal of the appellant 
wife and set aside the order of the Madras High Court 
dated 01.12.2022 and restore the order of the Family 
Court. The respondent husband is directed to pay a 
sum of Rs.1,75,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and Seventy 
Five 
Thousand 
only) 
per 
month 
as 
interim 
maintenance as per the order of the Family Court 
dated 14.06.2022.  
13. The appeal of respondent husband is accordingly 
dismissed in view of the above reasoning.
