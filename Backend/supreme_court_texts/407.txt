1. 
These interlocutory applications have been preferred by the 
applicant M/s Shewalkar Developers Limited being aggrieved by

No. 20, Civil Station, Pachmarhi, District Hoshangabad, Madhya 
Pradesh. The total area of these two plots is around 59,265 sq. ft. 
and 49,675 sq. ft., respectively.  
2. 
The applicant herein approached the Madhya Pradesh High 
Court by filing Writ Petition No. 14478 of 2006 seeking a direction 
to the respondents to favourably consider the prayer of the 
applicant. Vide order dated 22nd November, 2006, the Division 
Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court permitted the applicant to 
approach the Central Empowered Committee(hereinafter being 
referred to as ‘CEC’) constituted under the directions given by this 
Court in Writ Petition(Civil) No. 202 of 1995. Consequently, the 
applicant preferred an application to the CEC seeking permission 
to construct the health/eco-resort on the land mentioned above 
asserting that the said chunk of land was not a forest land and 
had been acquired under valid title deeds and thus, the prayer for 
permission to construct may be allowed. However, the prayer made 
by the applicant was not accepted whereupon, the applications 
under consideration came to be filed before this Court.  
3. 
The State Government had previously taken a stand in its 
counter that the land in issue falls within the limits of Pachmarhi 
Wildlife Sanctuary and therefore, by virtue of the directions issued 

3 
 
by the CEC vide letter dated 2nd July, 2004, no commercial activity 
was permissible thereupon, without the permission of this Court.

revisions against the mutation orders issued in favour of 
Kripa Torry and Sanjay Bhandari(purchasers of land from 
Dennis Torry) and vide order dated 9th August, 2004,  these 
revisions were allowed holding that the transfer of land by the 
perpetual land holder Rodrigues in favour of Dennis Torry on 
8th September, 1977 was illegal and without force of law and

Pradesh is with respect to the identification of the land owned by

Pachmarhi Wildlife Sanctuary. Considering the above contention, 
this Court raised the following query on 22nd November, 2023: -  
“2. We, therefore, direct the Collector, Hosangabad to file an 
affidavit annexing therewith a map of the aforesaid area of 
395.939 hectares and also specify as to whether the land 
belonging to the applicant(s) is within those 395.939 hectares 
or beyond that area.”

In compliance of the said direction, an affidavit has been filed 
on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh(also referred to as, 
‘compliance affidavit’). The relevant portions thereof are extracted 
hereinbelow: - 
“2. That, this Hon'ble Court has raised following queries to the

that the land mentioned, NazulBhumi Sheet No.20, Plot No.14/3 
and 14/4, area 59255 sq. ft. and 49365 sq. ft. total area 108900

Khasra in the Government of M.P. The plot No.14/3, 14/4 is 
within the area of 395.939 hectares which was excluded 
from the Panchmarhi Wildlife Sanctuary.

That, it is respectfully submitted that in respect of Plot 
No.14/3 and 14/4 a report was sought from Sub-Divisional 
Officer, Revenue, Pipariya whereby it was reported that Plot 
No.14/3 and 14/4 are recorded in name of State of M.P. in Sheet 
No.20 of Nazul Maintenance Khasra No.2023-24, said land of 
Plot No.14/3 and 14/4 is vacant on the spot, there is no kind

jurisdiction of Chief Executive Officer, Special Area 
Development Authority (SADA), Pachmarhi, In respect of

8. 
That, on 03.01.2014, the Hon'ble High Court of M.P. at 
Jabalpur passed an order in W.P. No.8098/2018 in petition filed 
by Kripa Tori and others challenging the order dated 15.03.2011 
of the Board of Revenue. The Hon'ble High Court set aside the 
order dated 15.03.2011 and thereby restored the previous order 
dated 22.07.1995 whereby the order of the Nazul Adhikari had 
been affirmed. 
A true copy of the order dated 03.01.2014 passed by the Hon'ble 
High Court of M.P. at Jabalpur in Writ Petition No.8098/2011 is 
being marked and filed herewith as Annexure A-9. 
It is pertinent to mention here that the aforesaid order dated 
03.01.2014 of the Hon'ble High Court is in respect of Plot 
No.14/1 and 14/2 whereas the applicant herein is claiming relief 
in respect of Plot No.14/3 and 14/4 which were purchased by 
Ashutosh S/o Shriram Shewalkar and M/s Shewalkar 
Developers Pvt. Ltd. on 13.09.1991. The said Plot No.14/3 and 
14/4 at present are recorded in the name of State of M.P. as 
Nazul Land. The State of Madhya being aggrieved with the order 
dated 03.01.2014 has filed an appeal before the Division Bench 

11 
 
of the Hon'ble High Court which is pending adjudication as Writ 
Appeal No.2100/2019. 
9. 
That, it is submitted here that the said proceedings

and the present intervenor M/s Shewalkar Developers was 
not a party before any of the Revenue Courts or the High 
Courts. 
10. That, as per notification dated 19.08.2017, the area 
under the entire Pachmarhi region admeasuring 1532.521 
hectares has been declared as "Eco-sensitive Zone" and the 
Plot No.14/3 and 14/4 fall within the notified boundaries of 
said notification. 
11. That, in view of notification dated 09.08.2017 "no new 
resort can be constructed and only repairs etc. can be done". 
Moreover, the Hon'ble High Courtvide interim order dated

making following observation:- 
"Subject to hearing other side, further construction in and 
around Pachmarhi Hill Resort is stayed till further order". 
The aforesaid clarification about stay order being applicable only 
to new construction has been reiterated by the Hon'ble High 
Court in its order dated 22.01.2004 in following words:- 
“By further order dated 13.07.2004, the interim order was 
clarified that the order of stay will not come in the way of 
repairing of roads by the State or carrying out repairs to existing 
building by respective provided, however, that repairs work of 
any building can be undertaken only after taking due permission 
from the concerned authority.”” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (emphasis supplied) 
10. Shri D.S. Naidu, learned senior counsel representing the 
applicant drew the Court’s attention to the order dated 15th 
December, 2000 passed by the Department Officer(SDO), Pipariya 
on the application preferred by the applicant seeking mutation 
based on a registered sale deed dated 13th September, 1991 
executed by the land owner Dennis Torry in favour of the 
applicant. The SDO accepted the said application taking note of 

12 
 
the fact that Plot No.14 admeasuring 3,23,365 sq. ft. was entered 
in the name of Dennis Torry who sought and was granted 
permission to sell the plot in question, by the Government of 
Madhya Pradesh vide order dated 1st May, 1991.  Thereafter, by a 
registered sale deed dated 13th September, 1991, Dennis Torry had 
sold the subject plots of land to Ashutosh Shewalkar on behalf of 
the applicant company. Consequently, the SDO directed that the 
land sold by Dennis Torry should be mutated in the name of M/s 
Shewalkar Developers Ltd. through Ashutosh Shewalkar, resident 
of Nagpur.  There is no dispute that the aforesaid order passed by 
the jurisdictional Revenue Officer in favour of the applicant has 
not been questioned in any Court of law. 
11. Shri Naidu also drew the Court’s attention to the report of the 
CEC dated 16th June, 2020, as per which the permission to 
construct has been denied to the applicant on the ground that the 
State of Madhya Pradesh had filed an affidavit stating that the land 
falls in the Pachmarhi Wildlife Sanctuary and that the same had 
been purchased in violation of the provisions of the Wild 
Life(Protection) Act, 1972. 
12. Shri Naidu contended that this objection raised by the State 
with reference to the Eco Sensitive Zone(hereinafter being referred 

13 
 
to as ‘ESZ’) notification dated 9th August, 2017 is totally against 
the material available on record.  He drew the Court’s attention to 
the site map dated 26th December, 2023(Annexure A-1 annexed 
with the compliance affidavit dated 12th February, 2024 filed by 
the respondent-State of Madhya Pradesh) to contend that as a 
matter of fact, the land owned by the applicant is located right on 
the periphery of the Nazul land, at a distance of about 10 kms. 
from the forest area and therefore, the same is well beyond the ESZ 
area. 
13. Shri Naidu further submitted that in view of the categoric 
assertion made in the compliance affidavit dated 12th February, 
2024, filed on behalf of the State, it is clear that the plots in 
question are located in the urban area of Pachmarhi and thus, 
there is no question of these plots being covered either under the 
wildlife sanctuary or the ESZ area. He thus urged that the 
applicant deserves the relief sought for. 
14. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondents 
have opposed the submissions advanced by Mr. Naidu.  Learned 
counsel for the State of Madhya Pradesh urged that the plots in 
question are subject matter of litigation in the writ appeal pending 
before the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court and 

14 
 
thus, the applicant should await the outcome of the aforesaid writ  
appeal before seeking permission to construct the health/eco-
resort on the land in question.   
15. His further contention was that the plots in question are 
recorded in the name of the State of Madhya Pradesh and hence, 
the applicant cannot claim any right thereupon. 
16. Mr. K. Parameshwar, learned Amicus Curiae appearing on 
behalf of the CEC submitted that in view of the ESZ notification 
dated 9th August, 2017, permission to raise a new construction on 
the land in question cannot be granted and whatever permissions 
are sought for, have to be routed through the CEC. 
17. Learned counsel appearing for the Union of India adopted the 
submissions advanced by the standing counsel for the State and 
learned Amicus Curiae. 
18. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the 
submissions advanced at bar and have gone through the material 
placed on record. 
19. It is not in dispute that the applicant herein was never 
impleaded in any of the proceedings before the Revenue Courts or 
the High Court as has been emphatically stated in Para-9 of the 

15 
 
compliance affidavit dated 12th February, 2024. It is thus, clear 
that irrespective of the fact that the order passed by the District 
Collector dated 9th August, 2004, purportedly covers entire area of 
the Plot No. 14 and the transactions done in favour of and by 
Dennis Torry, the sale deed executed in favour of the applicant and 
the mutation made in its name had never been questioned in any 
Court of law. Neither the Revenue Department nor the State 
Government authorities took the trouble of impleading the 
applicant as party in any of the abovementioned litigations. The 
title acquired by the applicant over the subject plots not having 
been challenged, attainted finality and thus the State cannot claim 
a right thereupon simply because at some point of time, the plots 
came to be recorded as Nazul lands in the revenue records. The 
categoric stand in the compliance affidavit filed by the 
State(reproduced supra) fortifies the claim of the applicant that 
these plots are falling under the urban area. 
20. In this background, the applicant is justified in claiming that 
its proprietary rights guaranteed under Article 300A of the 
Constitution of India cannot be infringed merely on account of the 
pending writ appeal before the Madhya Pradesh High Court. 

16 
 
21. Resultantly, we are of the firm opinion that the permission 
sought by the applicant for raising construction of health/eco-
resort cannot be opposed only on account of pendency of the writ 
appeal before the Madhya Pradesh High Court. However, it can be 
said without a cavil of doubt that activities, if any, on the Plot Nos. 
14/3 and 14/4 purchased by the applicant from Dennis Torry 
would have to be carried out strictly in accordance with the ESZ 
notification dated 9th August, 2017, issued by the Ministry of 
Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Nonetheless, the 
applicant would be at liberty to satisfy the authorities that the 
plots in question are beyond the Eco-Sensitive Zone.  
22. Furthermore, since the writ appeal pending before the 
Madhya Pradesh High Court arises out of the orders passed in 
relation to the title rights of Dennis Torry, from whom the applicant 
purchased the plots in question, the activities, if any, undertaken 
by the applicant on the said plot of land would also remain subject 
to the outcome of the said writ appeal.  
23. We, therefore, direct that the application filed by the 
applicant for raising construction on plot Nos. 14/3 and 14/4 shall
