3. Smt. Sasikala and K. Satyanarayana (original 
vendees) entered into an agreement to sell dated 
24.05.1981 with Muni Venkata Reddy and his 
four sons (original vendors) for sale of Survey 
No.129, New No.220/01, Site No.14 situated at 
Kodihali Village, HAL, S.B. Area, Bangalore-17 
measuring East to West 132 feet and North to 
South 40 feet total 5280 sq. feet (hereinafter 
referred to as the “property in dispute”). The total 
sale consideration was stated to be Rs.29,000/-, 
out of which, an advance of Rs.12,000/- was paid 
at the time of agreement to sell dated 24.05.1981. 
The balance amount was to be paid at the time of 
registration of the sale deed. The necessity for 
sale had arisen because of want of funds by the 
vendors. The stipulated period was fixed as three 
months, but as there were restrictions of 
registration of sale deeds with respect to similar 
revenue sites and survey numbers, as such, the 
sale deed would be executed immediately after 
the cancellation of the said Government Order. 
The agreement to sell also mentioned that 
possession of the site would be given that very 
day. 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017

4. After expiry of three months from the date of 
agreement, when the plaintiffs did not come 
forward to get the sale deed executed, the 
defendant no.1 sent communication dated 
23.09.1981 to the plaintiff stating that he has not 
come forward to solve the problem as the 
decision to sell was only because of his financial 
problems. The defendant extended the period of 
three months' time by another week from that 
day and if he did not get any information from 
their side, he would give the site to some other 
party. Thereafter, after waiting for two more 
months, legal notice was given through Advocate 
to the plaintiffs on 18.11.1981 stating that, as he 
had failed to get the sale deed executed within 
three months after payment of balance amount 
of Rs.17,000/-, defendant no.1 has forfeited his 
earnest money; the agreement dated 24.05.1981 
has come to an end,  and; as such, he had lost 
all interest and right over the said property and 
had also lost the earnest money because of its 
forfeiture. It was also stated that he was not in a 
position to pay the balance amount of the sale 
price. 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 4 of 33 
 
5. A reply was given by the plaintiffs through their 
Advocate on 
02.12.1981 
stating 
that 
the 
plaintiffs had not only given Rs.12,000/- as 
advance money but had further given additional 
Rs.2,000/-, for which no receipt was issued. 
Thus, the total advance amount was Rs.14,000/-. 
It was also stated that as per the agreement, 
although the period mentioned was three months, 
but there was a further stipulation that as there 
was restriction for registering the sale deeds 
pertaining to similar revenue sites, as such, it 
was only after cancelling of such restrictions by 
the Government that the sale deed was to be 
registered. As such, the agreement would be alive 
till the Government lifts the ban on registering 
the sale deeds pertaining to similar revenue sites. 
It further mentioned that as soon as registration 
of documents is opened, they would get the sale 
deed registered. It was also stated that forfeiture 
of the amount was without any right and the 
agreement could not be treated as cancelled. It 
was also denied that plaintiffs did not have 
money to pay the balance sale price. 
6. In response to the above reply, defendant no.1, 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 5 of 33 
 
through his counsel, again replied on 11.12.1981 
denying the payment of additional amount of 
Rs.2,000/-. It further stated that the contract 
had been entered because of urgent need of 
money by the defendants and the price for sale 
had been lowered to Rs.29,000/- because of 
urgency, even though the property was then 
valued at more than Rs.50,000/-. The balance 
amount was to be paid, in any case, within three 
months, which plaintiffs had failed to do, as such, 
the forfeiture had been rightly done. It was also 
stated that plaintiffs had been deliberately 
delaying and that they were never ready from the 
very beginning with the funds. Plaintiffs did not 
give any reply to the communication dated 
11.12.1981. 
7. After above correspondence, the defendants 
executed two sale deeds on 22nd April, 1983 and 
on 22nd June, 1983 in favour of defendant nos.6 
and 7 of part of the land agreed to be sold to the 
plaintiffs. There is also a reference of a third sale 
deed in favour of one C. Nagaraju with respect to 
the remaining area covered under the agreement 
to sell. Thus, the total area under the agreement 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 6 of 33 
 
to sell dated 24.05.1981 had been sold by the 
defendants 1 to 5 in favour of defendant nos.6, 7 
and C. Nagaraju. 
8. It was after the execution of the two sale deeds 
mentioned above, the plaintiffs instituted suit for 
specific performance and permanent injunction 
in the Court of Civil Judge, Bangalore on 
29.07.1983 registered as O.S. No.2188 of 1983. 
The defendants filed written statements and 
prayed for dismissal of the suit on various 
grounds. Both parties led evidence. The Trial 
Court vide judgment dated 22.10.2002 decreed 
the suit for specific performance and directed the 
defendants 1 to 7 to execute the sale deed in 
favour of the plaintiffs after accepting the balance 
consideration within three months from the date 
of the order. However, it denied the relief of 
permanent injunction on the finding that the 
plaintiffs were not in possession of the suit land. 
The present appellant alone preferred appeal 
before the High Court, which was registered as 
RFA No.362 of 2003. The High Court, by the 
impugned judgment dated 17.12.2015, has 
dismissed the appeal giving rise to the present 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 7 of 33 
 
appeal. 
9. The pleadings as reflected from reading of the 
plaint are as follows: 
(a) Parties had entered into an agreement to sell 
dated 24.05.1981. The defendants 1 to 5 were 
to transfer the property in dispute in favour of 
the plaintiffs for total sale consideration of 
Rs.29,000/-, out of which Rs.12,000/- was 
paid as advance and a further amount of 
Rs.2000/- was paid on 22.07.1981, thus, 
totalling the advance amount to Rs.14,000/-. 
The transaction was to be completed within 
three months from the time when the 
Government would remove the restriction for 
registration of the sale deed of lands similar to 
the property in dispute and that the expenses 
were to be borne by the plaintiffs.  
(b) In paragraph-4, it was stated that the 
plaintiffs were always ready and willing to 
perform their part of obligation and that they 
are ready even now to perform their part, 
however, it was the defendants 1 to 5 who had 
been dragging their feet and had been taking 
time for performing the remaining part of the 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 8 of 33 
 
agreement. They also became elusive and 
non-committal. The reason for the same was 
that the price of the property had shown an 
upward trend and, as a result of which, 
defendants were backing out. The plaintiffs 
also tendered the money and the draft sale 
deed requesting the defendants to execute the 
sale deed but they denied the execution as 
period of three months had expired.  
(c) A reference was also mentioned in the plaint 
with regard to the notice given through an 
Advocate on 19.11.1981. A reference to the 
restrictions 
on 
registration 
by 
the 
Government was also mentioned and it was 
stated that the period of three months would 
run from the time, the restriction was lifted.  
(d) It was also mentioned that the plaintiffs 
sought intervention of well-wishers to settle 
the matter amicably but the same did not bear 
any fruit.  
(e) It further mentioned that the defendants 1 to 
5 have proceeded to sell two portions of the 
property in dispute in favour of defendant 
nos.6 and 7, who were fully aware of the 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 9 of 33 
 
earlier agreement to sell in favour of the 
plaintiffs, but despite the same they got the 
sale deed executed in their favour; that the 
defendants 1 to 5 were attempting to sell the 
remaining portion of the scheduled property.  
(f) Accordingly, after stating the cause of action, 
the valuation of the suit and the payable court 
fees, relief claimed was for a direction to the 
defendants to transfer the property in dispute 
in favour of the plaintiffs by way of absolute 
sale and to get the sale deed executed and 
registered in accordance with law in terms of 
the agreement dated 24.05.1981. Further, 
relief of granting permanent injunction was 
also claimed restraining the defendants 1 to 5 
from alienating or otherwise dealing with any 
portion of the plaint scheduled property and 
from interfering in their possession. 
10. Defendants 1 to 5 filed a common written 
statement which briefly raised the following 
issues and objections: 
a) A plea was taken that the contents of the 
agreement to sell disclosed only the name of 
defendant no.1 and not of his four sons 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 10 of 33 
 
defendants 2 to 5. As such, the agreement was 
only by defendant no.1 and not by defendants 
2 to 5 and, as such, not binding upon them.  
b) It was next stated that the advance amount 
paid was only Rs.12,000/- at the time of 
execution of the agreement to sell. No further 
amount of Rs.2,000/- was paid as alleged.  
c) It was next stated that the plaintiffs were never 
ready and willing to perform their part of 
contract at any point of time, which was agreed 
to be three months, or even thereafter. The 
defendant had also given repeated notices but 
despite the same, the plaintiffs never came 
forward to clear the balance amount as the 
defendants were in need of money, they were 
left with no option but to execute the sale deeds.  
d) It was also stated that even after the 
restrictions for registration had been removed 
by the Government of Karnataka, the plaintiffs 
did not come forward to pay the balance 
amount and get the sale deed executed. This 
fact was clearly mentioned in their notice dated 
11.12.1981 but no reply to the same was given 
by the plaintiffs.  

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 11 of 33 
 
e) It also stated that plaintiffs were middlemen 
and not genuine purchasers. They never had 
any funds to fulfil the contract.  
f) It was specifically pleaded that time was 
essence of the contract. It was clearly denied 
that the plaintiffs ever came forward to tender 
the balance amount to get the sale deed 
executed. It was also denied that any 
Panchayat was convened to resolve the issue.  
g) Lastly, it was stated that the entire property 
had been sold and given in possession of the 
subsequent defendants 6, 7 and C. Nagaraju.  
h) It was denied that the plaintiffs were ever put 
into possession. 
11. Defendant no.6 also filed a written statement 
denying the plaint allegations and stating that he 
was in possession from the date of the sale deed 
in June, 1983. 
12. On behalf of the plaintiffs, four (4) witnesses were 
examined. Plaintiff no.1 was examined as PW-1 
and three (3) other witnesses were examined as 
P.W.-2 to 4, two of whom were marginal 
witnesses to the agreement to sell. Nine (9) 
documents were filed and marked as Exts. PW-1 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 12 of 33 
 
to PW-9 on behalf of the plaintiffs. On behalf of 
the defendants, one of the sons of defendant no.1 
was examined as DW-1 and, further, one of the 
sons of defendant no.6 was examined as DW-2. 
On behalf of the defendants, fourteen (14) 
documents were filed and exhibited as Ext. DW-
1 to DW-14. 
13. The Trial Court framed as many as 12 issues 
which are reproduced hereunder: - 
“1. 
Whether defendants 2 to 5 agreed 
to sell the suit property to the plaintiffs? 
 
2. What are the amounts advanced by 
plaintiffs to defendants 1 to 5? 
 
3. Whether the plaintiffs paid a further 
sum of Rs.2000/- on 22.07.1981 as 
further advance to defendants 1 to 5? 
 
4. Whether the time is the essence of the 
contract for sale and as the plaintiffs 
failed to perform their part of the 
obligation within the period of three 
months, the plaintiffs cannot specifically 
enforce the contract? 
 
5. Whether the suit agreement is not 
enforceable for all or any of the reasons 
stated by the defendants 1 to 5? 
 
6. Whether the defendants nos.6 and 7 
are not the bona fide transferee for value 
of two portions of the plaint schedule 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 13 of 33 
 
properties without notice to the alleged 
contract for sale? 
 
7. Whether the defendant 6 had no 
knowledge of the suit agreement for sale 
between the plaintiffs and defendants 1 
to 5 and she is a bona fide purchaser for 
value? 
 
8. Whether the plaintiffs have lost their 
right even to claim refund of the amounts 
paid by them to defendants 1 to 5 ? 
 
9. Whether the defendants 1 to 5 have 
committed breach of the terms of the 
agreement of sale by their stand taken 
not to execute the sale deed after expiry 
of three months and also by selling two 
portions of the schedule property in favour 
of the defendants 6 and 7? 
 
10. 
Whether the plaintiffs are entitled 
to the relief of specific performance in 
respect of the suit property? 
 
11.Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the 
relief of permanent injunction? 
 
12. 
To what relief is the plaintiff 
entitled?” 
 
14. The findings of the Trial Court on the above 
issues are given in paragraph 16 of the judgment 
which is reproduced hereunder: 
“1. 
In the affirmative 
2.      
Rs.12,000/-

15. As already noted above, vide judgment dated 
22.10.2002, the Trial Court decreed the suit for 
specific performance only and declined the relief 
for permanent injunction. The High Court, after 
hearing the counsel for the parties, framed six 
points for consideration, which are reproduced 
hereunder: 
“1. 
Whether plaintiffs have proved 
that agreement of sale dated 24.05.1981 
has been duly executed by defendants 1 
to 5? 
 
2. Whether parties to the agreement dated 
24.05.1981 had agreed that time is the 
essence of said contract? 
 
3. Whether agreement of sale dated 
24.05.1981 is hit by any of the provisions 
of Contract Act, 1872? 
 
4. Whether defendant no.6 proves that he 
is a bona fide purchaser of portion of suit 
schedule property without notice of earlier 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 15 of 33 
 
agreement of sale dated 24.05.1981? 
 
5. Whether 
defendant 
no.7 
i.e. 
Respondent no.9 herein is entitled for an 
opportunity to file written statement and 
as such, matter requires to be remanded 
back to the trial court by setting aside 
judgment and decree under challenge? 
 
6. Whether judgment and decree passed 
by the trial court decreeing the suit O.S. 
No.2188/1983 for specific performance 
suffers from any patent illegality on 
account of either non-appreciation of 
available 
evidence 
or 
erroneous 
appreciation 
of 
evidence 
calling 
for 
exercise of appellate jurisdiction by 
setting aside the same? And what order?” 
 
16. On point No.1, the High Court held that 
agreement to sell was executed by all the 
defendants i.e. 1 to 5. On point no.2, the High 
Court held that time was not the essence of 
contract. On point no.3, it held that the contract 
was not opposed to public policy nor hit by 
Section 23 of The Indian Contract Act, 1872. On 
point no.4, it was held that defendants 6 to 7 had 
failed to discharge the burden that they were 
bona fide purchasers for value without notice. On 
point no.5, it was held that defendant no.7 had 
lost the opportunity to contest and on point no.6, 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 16 of 33 
 
the High Court held that the judgment of the 
Trial Court did not suffer from any infirmity on 
any count and, accordingly, proceeded to dismiss 
the appeal while confirming the judgment of the 
Trial Court.      
17. We have heard Sri Arvind Verma, learned Senior 
Counsel appearing for the appellants and Sri 
Sanjay 
Parikh, 
learned 
Senior 
Counsel, 
appearing for the respondents and have perused 
the material on record.  
18. The submissions of Mr. Verma on behalf of the 
appellant are briefly summarized hereunder: 
a) No evidence was produced by the plaintiffs 
regarding the alleged ban on registration of 
revenue sites/survey numbers similar to the 
land in suit. 
b) Only bald and vague averments have been 
made to show that the plaintiffs were ready 
and willing to perform their part. No specific 
details were mentioned, as such, the suit was 
hit by Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act, 
19631. 
 
1 In short, “the Act, 1963 ” 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 17 of 33 
 
c) The appellant was a bona fide purchaser for 
value without notice. He had exercised due 
diligence before purchasing the part of the 
land in suit. As the agreement to sell dated 
24.05.1981 was an unregistered document, 
even the Sub-Registrar's Office could not have 
provided any information regarding the said 
agreement to sell. 
d) The High Court failed to consider the effect of 
the provisions contained in Section 53(A) of 
the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 2  which 
extended full protection to the appellant. 
e) The possession of the land in dispute was 
never with the plaintiffs and has throughout 
remained with the appellant and other 
subsequent purchasers. 
f) The High Court committed serious error in not 
relying upon the correspondence between the 
defendant no.1 and the plaintiffs relating to 
the request of the defendant no.1 regarding 
payment of balance consideration and for 
getting the sale deed executed as registered. 
 
2 In short, “the Act, 1882” 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 18 of 33 
 
g) It would be highly inequitable to grant the 
specific performance after 43 years in order to 
disturb the settled proprietary possession of 
not only the appellant but also the other 
subsequent purchasers.  
h) The High Court ought to have denied specific 
performance, however, any other relief could 
have been considered and moulded in favour 
of the plaintiffs. 
i) The plaintiffs did not seek decree for 
declaration of the sale deeds in favour of the 
appellant as null and void or for its 
cancellation. Further no relief for possession 
was sought as such the suit would be barred. 
19. Shri Verma, learned counsel appearing for the 
appellants relied upon the following judgments in 
support of his submissions:

Aniglase Yohannan Vs. Ramlatha

(5) 
Azhar Sultana Vs. B. Rajamani and 
others7;   
20. On the other hand, Sri Sanjay Parikh, learned 
Senior Counsel appearing for the contesting 
respondents made the following submissions, 
which are summarized hereunder: 
a) The appeal is concluded by concurrent findings 
of fact recorded by both the Courts below. 
b) There is no perversity in the judgment of the 
High Court warranting interference under 
Article 136. 
c) The appellant No.2/defendant no.7 has no 
right to challenge the impugned judgment as 
he failed to file written statement or adduce 
any evidence before the Trial Court. 
d) The 
application 
filed 
by 
defendant 
no.7/appellant no.2 under Order 41 Rule 33 of 
CPC before the High Court had been rejected. 
 
5 (005) 7 SCC 7

7 (2009) 17 SCC 27 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 20 of 33 
 
He could, thus, make submissions only on the 
rejection of his application under Order 41 
Rule 33 CPC and not on merits. 
e) The original vendors, defendant nos.1 to 5, did 
not challenge the judgment and decree of the 
Trial Court. 
f) Defendant no.6 had died during the pendency 
of the proceedings and was succeeded by six 
legal representatives, out of whom, only one i.e. 
the 
appellant 
no.1 
has 
challenged 
the 
judgment. 
g) No benefit can be granted to the appellant or 
the subsequent purchasers under Section 19(b) 
of the Specific Relief Act as they had due notice 
and knowledge of the agreement to sell and, 
therefore, their contract of sale was not bona 
fide. 
h) The plaintiffs have fully established and proved 
their readiness and willingness both in their 
pleadings as also through their evidence. 
i) Time was not the essence of the agreement as 
it was contingent upon the lifting of the ban 
imposed 
by 
the 
State 
Government 
on 
registration. 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 21 of 33 
 
j) The agreement to sell did not compulsorily 
require registration to bring a suit for specific 
performance as the same is permitted under 
the proviso of Section 49 of the Registration Act, 
19088. 
k) Relief of possession is inherent in a suit for 
specific performance and separate relief for 
possession is not required to be claimed.

another Vs. Vasantha22;  
22. Having considered the submissions, our analysis 
is as follows: 
(i) Relief of specific performance of contract is a 
discretionary relief. As such, the Courts while 
exercising 
power 
to 
grant 
specific 
performance of contract, need to be extra 
careful and cautious in dealing with the 
pleadings and the evidence in particular led 
by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have to stand 
on their own legs to establish that they have 
made out case for grant of relief of specific 
performance of contract. The Act, 1963 
provides certain checks and balances which 
must be fulfilled and established by the 
plaintiffs before they can become entitled for 
such a relief. The pleadings in a suit for 
specific performance have to be very direct, 
specific and accurate. A suit for specific 
performance based on bald and vague 
pleadings must necessarily be rejected. 
Section 16(C) of the 1963 Act requires 
 
22 (2022) SCC Online SC 2096 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 24 of 33 
 
readiness and willingness to be pleaded and 
proved by the plaintiff in a suit for specific 
performance of contract. The said provision 
has been widely interpreted and held to be 
mandatory. A few of authorities on the point 
are referred hereunder: 
a) In the case of Man Kaur v. Hartar Singh 
Sangha23, this Court held in paragraph 40 
which is reproduced hereunder: 
“40………A person who fails to aver and 
prove that he has performed or has always 
been ready and willing to perform the 
essential terms of the contract which are to 
be performed by him (other than the terms 
the 
performance 
of 
which 
has 
been 
prevented or waived by the defendant) is 
barred from claiming specific performance. 
Therefore, 
even 
assuming 
that 
the 
defendant had committed breach, if the 
plaintiff fails to aver in the plaint or prove 
that he was always ready and willing to 
perform the essential terms of contract 
which are required to be performed by him 
(other than the terms the performance of 
which has been prevented or waived by the 
plaintiff), 
there 
is 
a 
bar 
to 
specific 
performance in his favour. Therefore, the 
assumption 
of 
the 
respondent 
that 
readiness and willingness on the part of the 
plaintiff is something which need not be 
proved, if the plaintiff is able to establish 
 
23 (2010) 10 SCC 512 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 25 of 33 
 
that the defendant refused to execute the 
sale deed and thereby committed breach, is 
not correct………….” 
 
b) In the case of U.N. Krishnamurthy (Since 
Deceased) 
Thr. 
Lrs. 
v. 
A.M. 
Krishnamurthy 24 , following was held in 
paragraph 46: 
“46. It is settled law that for relief of specific 
performance, the Plaintiff has to prove that 
all along and till the final decision of the suit, 
he was ready and willing to perform the part 
of the contract. It is the bounden duty of the 
Plaintiff 
to 
prove 
his 
readiness 
and 
willingness by adducing evidence. This 
crucial facet has to be determined by 
considering all circumstances including 
availability of funds and mere statement or 
averment in plaint of readiness and 
willingness, would not suffice.” 
 
c) In the case of His Holiness Acharya Swami 
Ganesh Dassji v. Sita Ram Thapar25, it was 
held under paragraph 2:  
“2. There is a distinction between readiness 
to perform the contract and willingness to 
perform the contract. By readiness may be 
meant the capacity of the plaintiff to 
perform the contract which includes his 
financial position to pay the purchase price. 
For determining his willingness to perform 
 
24 (2022) SCC Online SC 840 
25 (1996) 4 SCC 526, 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 26 of 33 
 
his part of the contract, the conduct has to 
be properly scrutinised. There is no 
documentary proof that the plaintiff had 
ever 
funds 
to 
pay 
the 
balance 
of 
consideration. Assuming that he had the 
funds, he has to prove his willingness to 
perform his part of the contract. According 
to the terms of the agreement, the plaintiff 
was to supply the draft sale deed to the 
defendant within 7 days of the execution of 
the agreement, i.e., by 27-2-1975. The draft 
sale deed was not returned after being duly 
approved by the petitioner. The factum of 
readiness 
and 
willingness 
to 
perform 
plaintiff’s part of the contract is to be 
adjudged with reference to the conduct of 
the party and the attending circumstances. 
The court may infer from the facts and 
circumstances whether the plaintiff was 
ready and was always ready and willing to 
perform his part of the contract. The facts 
of this case would amply demonstrate that 
the petitioner/plaintiff was not ready nor 
had the capacity to perform his part of the 
contract as he had no financial capacity to 
pay the consideration in cash as contracted 
and intended to bide for the time which 
disentitles him as time is of the essence of 
the contract.” 
 
(ii) In the present case, we find from a perusal of 
the plaint that, at the first instance, the 
plaintiffs failed to plead specifically with 
details about the restriction said to have been 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 27 of 33 
 
imposed by the State on registration of sale 
deeds relating to similar survey numbers and 
revenue sites. No details of the Government 
Order are mentioned. Neither the Government 
Order is placed on record as evidence to 
connect that such restriction was actually 
applicable to the land in question. 
(iii) Defendant nos.1 to 5 executed sale deeds in 
April and June, 1983 in favour of the 
appellant as also other purchasers. It is 
recorded by the Trial Court as also the High 
Court, that these sale deeds were executed by 
the defendants 1 to 5 after depositing some 
betterment 
charges, 
getting 
the 
land 
converted and then effecting the transfer. The 
plaintiffs do not seem to have ever approached 
the defendants to get this kind of a status 
change and, thereafter, get the sale deeds 
executed. It has not come either in pleadings 
or in evidence of the plaintiffs that the alleged 
ban imposed by the State Government had 
been lifted but still the sale deeds were 
executed in favour of the appellants and other 
purchasers in 1983.  

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 28 of 33 
 
(iv) If the plaintiffs were actually keen, ready and 
willing to get the land transferred or get the 
agreement to sell enforced, they should have 
made an effort in that regard. Neither any 
specific date has been mentioned in the 
pleadings or in the evidence, on which date 
the plaintiffs tendered the balance amount 
with a request to the defendants 1 to 5 to get 
the land status changed and execute the sale 
deed, 
or 
otherwise 
also, 
request 
the 
defendants 1 to 5 to execute the sale deed 
with the same status of the land in suit. 
(v) Even before filing a suit, there is no evidence 
forthcoming on behalf of the plaintiffs to show 
that they tendered the balance consideration 
or a draft sale deed to the defendants 1 to 5 
and requested for execution and registration 
of the sale deed. 
(vi) The Courts below have proceeded to hold that 
there was readiness and willingness primarily 
relying upon the restriction imposed by the 
State. According to them, as the restriction 
had not been lifted, there was no obligation on 
the part of the plaintiffs to have expressed any 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 29 of 33 
 
readiness or willingness. However, the Courts 
below failed to take into consideration that 
there was no evidence regarding the said ban. 
Further the Courts below also failed to take 
into consideration that a keen and a willing 
buyer would have found out a way for 
execution of the sale deed just as defendants 
6& 7 and C. Nagaraju. 
(vii) 
The Courts below also fell into error in 
recording a finding that the defendants 1 to 5 
had committed breach of contract and had 
dishonestly proceeded to get the status of the 
land changed and, thereafter, execute the sale 
deed in favour of the appellant and other 
purchasers.  
(viii) It is clear from the record that the 
defendant no.1 had given a written notice in 
September, 1981, then legal notice in 
November, 
1981 
and 
also 
another 
communication 
in 
December, 
1981 
requesting for payment of balance sale 
consideration and, thereafter communicating 
that advance amount had been forfeited and 
the agreement to sell had come to an end as 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 30 of 33 
 
the plaintiffs failed to get the sale deed 
executed 
within 
three 
months. 
After 
December, 1981, the plaintiffs kept silent. 
They 
neither 
responded 
to 
the 
last 
communication of the defendant no.1 of 
December, 1981, nor did they take any steps 
to file the suit for specific performance of 
contract for more than one and a half years 
after the defendant no.1 had communicated 
forfeiture of the earnest money and the 
cancellation of the agreement to sell. There is 
no communication from the plaintiffs after 
December, 1981 till July, 1983 when they 
filed the suit. There is not even a notice by the 
plaintiffs before filing the suit of showing their 
readiness and willingness by tendering the 
amount of balance sale consideration and 
sending a draft sale deed for approval and 
fixing a date for execution and registration of 
the sale deed. 
(xi) We are thus unable to agree with the findings 
of the courts below that the plaintiffs were 
always ready and willing to get the sale deed 
executed and registered. As a matter of fact, 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 31 of 33 
 
the conduct of the plaintiffs throughout gives 
credence and strength to the contention of the 
defendant nos.1 to 5 that the plaintiffs never 
had the funds available with them to clear the 
balance sale consideration and that they were 
middlemen only interested in blocking the 
property and, thereafter, selling it on a higher 
price to third parties and make profit thereof. 
The plaintiffs were never the real purchasers 
interested in buying the land in suit for 
themselves. 
(x) Under such facts and circumstances as 
discussed above, we are of the confirmed view 
that the decree of specific performance was 
not warranted in the present case and ought 
to have been denied and the suit was liable to 
be dismissed. 
(xi)  
In view of the finding on the issue of 
readiness and willingness being decided 
against the plaintiffs in the facts of the 
present case, we are not inclined to enter into 
other arguments raised by the learned Senior 
Counsel for the parties. 
(xii). However, in order to adjust equities 

SLP (CIVIL) NO. 2246 OF 2017    
 
Page 32 of 33 
 
between the parties, as the plaintiffs made a 
payment of Rs.12,000/- as advance money on 
24.05.1981 or before, that being an admitted 
position, 
they 
need 
to 
be 
suitably 
compensated for the same. About 43 years 
have passed since the date of the agreement 
to sell. According to the appellant as stated in 
the written brief, the value of the property is 
about four crores. The respondents have not 
given any such figure of the approximate 
value of the property in question. Considering 
the facts and circumstances, we direct that 
the appellant compensate the plaintiffs by 
paying an amount of Rs.24 lakhs in lieu of the 
advance and further Rs.6 lakhs as cost of 
litigation. Total amount of Rs.30 lakhs to be 
paid within a period of three months from 
today and file proof of such payment before 
this Court within the next four months. In the 
event, such proof is not filed, the Registry will 
list the matter before the Court immediately 
after expiry of the aforesaid period for further 
orders.

23. The 
Appeal 
is, 
accordingly, 
allowed. 
The 
impugned order is set aside. The suit is 
dismissed, however, with the direction as 
contained above regarding payment of Rs.30 
lakhs by the appellants to the plaintiffs-
respondents within the time stipulated above. 
24. Pending application/s, if any, is/are disposed of.
