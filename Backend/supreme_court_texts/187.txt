rigorous imprisonment under Sections 25/ 27 of the Arms Act, 
1959 (the “Arms Act”) with fine of Rs. 5,000/- and in default of

months.  
3. 
The 
judgment 
of 
conviction 
and 
sentence 
was 
unsuccessfully assailed by the appellant before the High Court of 
Judicature at Allahabad (the “High Court”) vide Criminal 
Appeal No. 1462 of 2018, titled ‘Shahid Ali v. State of U.P.’ 
which came to be dismissed by the High Court vide an order 
dated 04.04.2019 (the “Impugned Order”).  
4. 
On 03.12.2021, this Court issued notice limited to the 
question of nature of offence, that is, as to whether the Appellant 
could be held guilty of the offence under Section 304 Part I or 
Part II of the IPC as against Section 302 IPC.  
5. 
The facts of the case reveal that an FIR was lodged by PW1 
- Gulab Ali i.e., the chowkidar of village Katena Sikeriya, District 
Firozabad, at Police Station Jasrana, by stating that on 
17.03.2016, the marriage ceremony of the daughter of 
Nizamuddin was being celebrated. Pertinently (i) Ishfaq Ali (the 
“Deceased”); (ii) other co-accused person i.e., Shahid Ali; and 
(iii) other relatives were also invited to the said marriage. It was 
further stated in the FIR that on 17.03.2016 at about 3:30PM i.e., 

SLP(Crl.) No. 9454 of 2021 
 
Page 3 of 11 
 
amidst the marriage ceremony, the Appellant shot at Ishfaq Ali 
which resulted in an injury on his neck and ultimately led to his 
demise on the spot itself. In the FIR, previous enmity between 
the Deceased and the accused came to be revealed. Furthermore, 
it was stated that a large number of person(s) saw the alleged 
incident as there were many people at the marriage ceremony. 
Accordingly, an FIR came to be registered as Crime Case No. 
108 of 2016 under Section 302 IPC at PS Jasrana, District 
Firozabad. The said FIR has been proved as Ex. Ka-13. 
Thereafter an entry regarding FIR was made in the G.D. Rapat 
No. 34 Ex. Ka-4 on 17.03.2016 at 1705 hrs. Thereafter, PW 10 
i.e., Lokendra Pal Singh, Station House Officer at Police Station 
Jasrana, investigated the matter, conducted inquest on the dead 
body of the Deceased and prepared an inquest report (Ex.Ka-7). 
The site plan (Ex.Ka-5) was also prepared. The dead body of the 
Deceased was brought to the hospital and a post-mortem was 
carried out by a Medical Officer i.e., Dr. Nitin Jaggi, on 
18.03.2016. The statement of accused who was arrested was 
recorded in jail by the investigating officer and accused 
confessed to his guilt in his statement recorded under Section 161 
of Cr.P.C. Another FIR was also registered against the Appellant 
for an offence punishable under Section 25/27 of the Arms Act 
on 08.04.2016 which came to be registered as Case Crime No. 
147 of 2016, at PS Jasrana. An investigation was carried out in 

SLP(Crl.) No. 9454 of 2021 
 
Page 4 of 11 
 
pursuant to the FIR(s) and a charge-sheet was filed. The case was 
committed to the court of Sessions by the Magistrate and charges 
were framed for inter alia an offence punishable under Section 
302 of the Indian Penal Code and for offences punishable under 
Section 25/27 of the Arms Act.

8. 
The evidence on record has been carefully examined by 
this Court. PW1 Gulab Ali who was the informant of the case has 
initially supported the prosecution case. He has categorically 
stated that the Deceased was shot at with the country made pistol 
and the bullet hit him on his neck and thereafter succumbed to 
his injuries on the spot.   However, in his cross-examination, the 
same witness Gulab Ali stated that did not see the alleged incident 
with his own eyes and that he is unaware of any old enmity 
between the Deceased and the Appellant. He has further clarified 
in his cross-examination that he spoke about the enmity between 
the parties on the basis of hearsay evidence of the people who 
were present at marriage ceremony. 
9. 
PW2 Idrish Ali i.e., son of the Deceased who was present 
at the spot initially supported the prosecution case in his 
examination-in-chief, however, subsequently during his cross-
examination he has stated that there was no enmity between the 
Deceased and the Appellant his father and his father Ishfaq Ali 
was shot dead by some person on 17.03.2016.  PW2 also turned 
hostile during the trial.  PW3 Nizamuddin whose daughter’s 
marriage was being solemnized on 17.03.2016, also initially 
supported the prosecution case, however, in his cross-
examination, he has stated that the Appellant was his Bhanja and 
that he did not see the Appellant firing the shot at Deceased.  PW4 
Raju Ali also categorically stated that there was no enmity 

SLP(Crl.) No. 9454 of 2021 
 
Page 6 of 11 
 
between Appellant and the Deceased and he was also declared as 
a hostile witness by the prosecution.  In his cross-examination, 
he has categorically stated that he has not given any statement 
incriminating the accused to the police.  PW5 Mohd. Shakeel 
who was also allegedly present at the time of incident did not 
support the prosecution case and he was also declared hostile.  
PW6 Shamsher Ali also did not support the prosecution case and 
he has categorically stated that he has not given any statement 
under Section 161 Cr.P.C. implicating the accused.  He was also 
declared hostile.  PW7 Chaman Babu, another eye witness, was 
also declared hostile.  PW 8 Dr. Nitin Jaggi who carried out the 
post-mortem stated before the Court that the Deceased died on 
account of gunshot wound and supported the prosecution case to 
the extent that he has carried out the post-mortem.  He has 
supported his opinion that the Deceased died on account of 
haemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem gun shot injuries.  PW9 
Head Constable Kshetrapal Singh who was a formal witness 
supported the prosecution case and proved the First Information 
Report which was lodged on 17.03.2016.  PW10 Station Officer 
Lokendra Pal Singh also supported the prosecution case.  PW11 
Sub Inspector Yashpal Singh who was present along with PW-10 
during the police custody remand of the Appellant has deposed 
that recovery of firearm and cartridge was made at the instance 
of the Appellant and has supported the prosecution case.  PW12 

SLP(Crl.) No. 9454 of 2021 
 
Page 7 of 11 
 
constable Bhupendra Singh who is also an eye witness of the 
recovery of the fire arm in question and the cartridge has also 
supported the prosecution case.   
10.  
The evidence on record reveals that all the eyewitnesses 
have turned hostile and the Trial Court on the basis of the 
evidence has arrived at the conclusion that the Appellant was 
guilty of the offences alleged under the FIR; and accordingly 
proceeded to convict the Appellant. Subsequently, the High Court 
affirmed the order passed by the Trial Court. Aggrieved, the 
Appellant preferred the present petition. Vide an order dated 
03.12.2021, this Court issued notice and on a limited question in 
the matter i.e. as to whether the appellant could be held guilty of 
offence under Section 304 Part I or Part II of the IPC, as against 
under Section 302 of the IPC.   
11. 
The undisputed facts of the case reveal that the incident 
took place on 17.03.2016 amidst the marriage ceremony of 
Nizamuddin’s daughter. Thereafter, the recovery of a weapon 
along with cartridge(s) from Appellant has been proved before 
the Trial Court.  It is also undisputed fact that the Deceased died 
on account of a single bullet injury; and that there was no known 
prior enmity between the Deceased and Appellant.  
12. 
The fulcrum of the dispute before this Court is whether the 
Appellant’s act of engaging in celebratory firing during a 

SLP(Crl.) No. 9454 of 2021 
 
Page 8 of 11 
 
marriage ceremony could be construed to be an act so imminently 
dangerous so as to, in all probability, cause death or such bodily 
injury as was likely to cause death?  
13.  
The act of celebratory firing during marriage ceremonies 
is an unfortunate yet prevalent practise in our nation. The present 
case is a direct example of the disastrous consequences of such 
uncontrolled and unwarranted celebratory firing. Be that as it 
may, in the absence of any evidence on record to suggest that 
either that the Appellant aimed at and / or pointed at the large 
crowd whilst engaging in such celebratory firing; or there existed 
any prior enmity between the Deceased and the Appellant, we 
find ourselves unable to accept the Prosecution’s version of 
events as were accepted by the Trial Court and confirmed by the 
High Court.  
14. 
At this juncture it would be apposite to refer to a decision 
of this Court in Kunwar Pal Singh v. State of Uttarakhand, 
(2014) 12 SCC 434 wherein, this Court in a similar situation 
observed as under:  
“12. In these circumstances, we find that the 
intention of the appellant to kill the deceased, if any, 
has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and 
in any case the appellant is entitled to the benefit of 
doubt which is prominent in this case. It is not 
possible therefore to sustain the sentence under 
Section 304 Part I IPC, which requires that the act 

SLP(Crl.) No. 9454 of 2021 
 
Page 9 of 11 
 
by which death is caused, must be done with the 
intention of causing death or with the intention of 
causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause 
death. Though it is not possible to attribute intention 
it is equally not possible to hold that the act was 
done without the knowledge that it is likely to cause 
death. Everybody, who carries a gun with live 
cartridges and even others know that firing a gun 
and that too in the presence of several people is an 
act, is likely to cause death, as indeed it did. Guns 
must be carried with a sense of responsibility and 
caution and are not meant to be used in such places 
like marriage ceremonies. 
x-x-x 
14. In the present case, we are of the view that the 
appellant is guilty of committing the act which 
caused the death of the deceased since the act was 
done with the knowledge that is it likely to cause 
death within the meaning of Section 304 Part II IPC. 
In the circumstances, the appeal is allowed in part, 
however, we reduce the sentence imposed upon the 
appellant to a period of 7 (seven) years without 
making any alteration in the fine amount imposed by 
the trial court and confirmed by the High Court.” 
15. 
Pertinently, the view in Kunwar Pal Singh (Supra) came 
to be followed in Bhagwan Singh v. State of Uttarakhand, 
(2020) 14 SCC 184 wherein this Court observed as under:  
“15. The facts and circumstances of the instant case, 
however, do not permit to draw such a conclusion. 
We have already rejected the prosecution version to 
the extent that the appellant aimed at Smt Anita and 
then fired the shot(s). The evidence on record 

SLP(Crl.) No. 9454 of 2021 
 
Page 10 of 11 
 
contrarily shows that the appellant aimed the gun 
towards the roof and then fired. It was an 
unfortunate case of misfiring. The appellant of 
course cannot absolve himself of the conclusion that 
he carried a loaded gun at a crowded place where 
his own guests had gathered to attend the marriage 
ceremony. He did not take any reasonable safety 
measure, like to fire the shot in the air or towards 
the sky, rather he invited full risk and aimed the gun 
towards the roof and fired the shot. He was expected 
to know that pellets could cause multiple gunshot 
injuries to the nearby persons even if a single shot 
was fired. The appellant is, thus, guilty of an act, the 
likely consequences of which including causing fatal 
injuries to the persons being in a close circuit, are 
attributable to him. The offence committed by the 
appellant, thus, would amount to “culpable 
homicide” within the meaning of Section 299, 
though punishable under Section 304 Part 2 IPC.” 
16. 
There can be no qualm about the fact that the Appellant 
opened fire in a crowded place i.e., a marriage ceremony without 
taking reasonable measures for safety, which led to the 
unfortunate demise of the Deceased.  
17. 
In this context, keeping in view the totality of 
circumstances of the case i.e., especially the fact that (i) there was 
no previous enmity between the Deceased; (ii) no intention may 
be attributed to the Appellant as may be culled out from the 
record to cause death of the Deceased; and (iii) position of law 
enunciated by this Court in Kunwar Pal Singh (Supra) and 
subsequently, followed in Bhagwan Singh (Supra), we find that 

SLP(Crl.) No. 9454 of 2021 
 
Page 11 of 11 
 
the Appellant is guilty of commission of ‘culpable homicide’ 
within the meaning of Section 299 IPC i.e., punishable under 
Section 304 Part II of the IPC. 
18. 
In view of the aforesaid, the conviction and sentence of the 
Appellant under Section 302 IPC is set aside. The Appellant is 
convicted for an offence under Section 304 Part II of the IPC.  
The appellant has already undergone approximately 8 years of 
incarceration.   Considering the facts and circumstances of the 
case, we award a sentence equivalent to the period already 
undergone.  The conviction and sentence awarded to the 
Appellant under Sections 25 & 27 of the Arms Act remains 
unaltered. Resultantly, the Appellant be released forthwith, if not 
required in any other case.  
19. 
The appeal is allowed accordingly, in part. Pending 
application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
