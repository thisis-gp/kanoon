1. 
This matter pertains to right to title and 
possession of a property that was allotted by 
the Relief and Rehabilitation Department of 
Government of West Bengal to a family which 
had come to Siliguri from the then East 
Pakistan in 1950. Before moving forward with 
the facts of the case, it is imperative for us to 
mention that such rehabilitation programmes 
are introduced by the government with the sole 
aim of re-establishment of the displaced/ 
migrant families and not for the benefit of any 
individual. As a part of such welfare policies, 
the property is usually recorded in the name of

one family member for the purpose of 
convenience even though the ensuing welfare 
is meant to be enjoyed by the all the family 
members equally. However unfortunately, in 
the instant case greed got better of the de facto 
head of the family who has been claiming 
herself as the absolute owner of the property. 
The matter is a prime example where the 
plaintiff attempted to defeat the rightful claims 
of family members with the intention of 
usurping the entire property. We cannot 
emphasize enough that this Court highly 
deprecates such malpractices where the 
welfare legislations are misused/abused by 
beneficiaries for personal advantage, thereby 
defeating the very objective of such policies.

This appeal assails the correctness of the 
judgment and order dated 18.12.2013 passed 
by the Calcutta High Court dismissing the 
Second Appeal No.518 of 2008 filed by the 
appellants herein confirming the judgment and 
decree of the First Appellate Court dated 
11.04.2003 whereby it had reversed the 
judgment and decree of the Trial Court dated 

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016

16.09.1999 dismissing the suit of the present 
respondents and allowing the counter claim 
filed by the present appellants in Original Civil 
Suit No.16 of 1983. 
3. 
Brief facts giving rise to the present appeal are 
summarized hereunder: 
3.1.  Late Krishna Behari Basak had three sons 
namely Benode Behari Basak, Bimal Kanti

The eldest son Benode Behari Basak was 
employed in the Collectorate, Darjeeling 
since 01.03.1945 and at the relevant time 
he was working in the office of Deputy 
Commissioner, Darjeeling. Benode Behari

3.2. In the said affidavit dated 30.12.1952, it is 
clearly stated that the deponent was 
residing 
at 
Darjeeling 
and 
was 
in 
occupation as a government servant; that 
he had a permanent house in village 
Sailabari, 
Post 
Office 
Khosabari, 
District Pabna which has since become a 
part of eastern Pakistan; the family 
members were compelled to leave the 
native place in July 1950 due to partition 

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 5 of 18 
 
of India; all family members have decided 
to settle in the Indian Union; he was 
working in the office of the Deputy 
Commissioner since 1945 and had opted 
to 
serve 
under 
the 
West 
Bengal 
Government.  
3.3. Another affidavit was filed by Smt. Hem 
Prova Basak wife of Benode Behari Basak 
dated 13.11.1953. In the said affidavit it 
was stated that they had to leave their 
house and properties in Pakistan worth 
about 
Rs.50,000/-, 
on 
account 
of 
communal disturbance; she along with the 
whole family consisting of five family 
members had come to West Bengal in July 
1950 with the object of permanently 
residing in the Union of India; that she was 
a bona fide refugee and now a domicile and 
a national of the Indian Dominion; that 
she had not taken any loan or advance 
from 
the 
Central 
or 
Provincial 
Governments.  
3.4. Based on the said applications supported 
by affidavits as stated above, the Deputy 

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 6 of 18 
 
Commissioner, Darjeeling on 04.12.1953 
forwarded the same to the Sub-Divisional 
Officer, Siliguri enclosing also along with it 
an 
order 
passed 
by 
the 
Deputy 
Commissioner, Darjeeling on 03.12.1953 
for taking appropriate action. The order 
passed by the Deputy Commissioner on 
03.12.1953 recorded that the family had 
lost their house in Pakistan as such 
allotment of plot in question be made in 
favour of Smt. Hem Prova Basak in place 
of her husband Benode Behari Basak.  
3.5. Even before the final allotment could be 
made and lease could be executed, the 
family started constructing the house over 
the plot in question. However, before the 
construction could be completed on 
07.02.1975, the said Benode Behari Basak 
recorded 
his 
statement 
before 
the 
authorities in which he admitted that he 
along with his family members, had 
migrated from East Pakistan to India; gave 
details of the property held in East 
Pakistan; that how he collected funds for 

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 7 of 18 
 
construction 
of 
the 
house. 
The 
construction was made out of the joint 
income of three brothers and also from the 
produce of the crops of the land that they 
held. It was also mentioned that they all 
lived jointly and all members contributed 
proportionately. 
3.6. A letter was issued by the Government of 
West Bengal on 28.09.1975 calling upon 
Smt. Hem Prova Basak to appear in the 
office of the Sub-Divisional Officer on 
24.09.1975 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
conferment of right, title and interest of the 
plot in question and also to produce 
documents relating to allotment of plot 
No.41. 
3.7. Another letter was issued by the office of 
Sub-Divisional 
Officer, 
Siliguri 
on 
25.09.1975 to Shri Benode Behari Basak 
stating that his two brothers had also 
applied for inclusion of their names along 
with name of his wife in the lease deed so 
that he could clarify in respect thereof. It 
appears that the lease deed was executed 

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 8 of 18 
 
on 03.11.1975 in the name of Smt. Hem 
Prova Basak only.  
3.8. The two brothers Bimal Kanti Basak and 
Benoy Kumar Basak represented for 
inclusion of their names which was 
appropriately dealt with by the concerned 
department and in the order sheet it was 
recorded on 03.08.1979 that the names of 
Bimal Kanti Basak and Benoy Kumar 
Basak be also included and there was no 
legal bar in inclusion of their names. The 
Sub-Divisional Officer passed an order on 
07.11.1979 that the request made for 
inclusion of their names is allowed and 
their names will be included at the time of 
execution of the deed along with Smt. Hem 
Prova Basak in respect to the plot in 
question being Plot No.41, Dabgram 
Colony No.II, College Para, Siliguri. 
3.9. Further, another order was passed on 
23.08.1983 that in the lease deed of 
03.11.1975, the rectification be allowed to 
the extent of adding the names of Bimal 
Kanti Basak and Benoy Kumar Basak 

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 9 of 18 
 
being family members of Smt. Hem Prova 
Basak as apparent from the original 
affidavit filed that they were family 
members taking into consideration the 
Government Orders dated 02.07.1981 and 
23.04.1981. Accordingly, a fresh lease 
deed be executed.  
3.10. In the meantime, Smt. Hem Prova Basak 
filed a suit for permanent injunction to 
restrain the families of Bimal Kanti Basak 
and Benoy Kumar Basak from changing 
the character of the suit property and from 
entering the same. By the time the suit 
was filed, Bimal Kanti Basak had died as 
such his legal heirs being his widow, two 
sons and a daughter were impleaded as 
defendants 1-A, 1-B, 1-C and 1-D and 
Benoy Kumar Basak as defendant No.2. In 
the said suit Smt. Hem Prova claimed that 
she was the sole lessee of the plot in 
question and that the said land had been 
allotted to her exclusively and that she had 
constructed the house which is recorded 
in her name as absolute owner. The 

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 10 of 18 
 
defendants being brothers of her husband 
and not having any independent house of 
their own to live, nor were they employed 
as such were permitted to live in a portion 
of the said house. Later on, they have been 
employed, 
have 
their 
independent 
separate families and as such they being 
licensees only, they must vacate the 
portion of the premises in their possession. 
The families of the three brothers had 
grown as such there was shortage of 
space. Also there were regular disputes 
between the usage of the property and 
common amenities and as such it became 
necessary to file a suit for their eviction. 
3.11. The defendants to the suit filed written 
statement 
along 
with 
counterclaim 
praying for a decree that the lease deed 
dated 03.11.1975 be declared as invalid 
and inoperative in law and for appropriate 
injunction 
against 
the 
plaintiff. 
The 
written statement and the counterclaim 
were based on the fact that the three 
brothers constituted the joint family; the 

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 11 of 18 
 
policy of the Government was to provide 
rehabilitation to the entire family and not 
to the individual; the request of the 
defendants to include their names in the 
lease deed had been positively considered 
by the Government; the house was 
constructed from the joint fund from the 
income of all the three brothers.  
3.12. During the pendency of the suit, the 
Government had come up with policy of 
freehold and had accordingly issued 
freehold title deeds separately with respect 
to the family of the three brothers. It had 
further canceled the lease deed dated 
03.11.1975 and the same was duly 
communicated to Smt. Hem Prova Basak 
vide communication dated 25.05.1995. In 
the said letter, it was clearly stated that as 
the freehold title deeds are going to be 
issued to the eligible beneficiaries, the 
lease deed No.7658 of 03.11.1975 has 
been cancelled and as such she was 
required to submit the original lease deed.  

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 12 of 18 
 
3.13. Smt. Hem Prova Basak instituted an 
Original 
Civil 
Suit 
No.68 
of 
1995 
impleading the State of West Bengal and 
its officers as defendants challenging the 
cancellation of the lease deed No.7685. 
The relief claimed in the said suit was that 
a declaration be made that the notice 
dated 25.05.1995 issued by the office of 
Sub-Divisional Officer, Siliguri, as illegal, 
invalid and without jurisdiction with the 
further relief of permanent injunction 
against the defendants restraining them to 
act upon the said notice.  
3.14. After a detailed inquiry, it was held that 
fresh freehold title deeds be issued as per 
calculation in paragraph ‘C’ of the said 
report in favour of the family members of 
all the brothers. The defendants to the suit 
of 1983 filed an amendment application 
under Order VI Rule 17, Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908, seeking amendment in 
the 
written 
statement 
in 
order 
to 
incorporate the subsequent development 
regarding the cancellation of lease deed as 

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 13 of 18 
 
also 
to 
issue 
freehold 
title 
deeds. 
Additionally, the plaintiff also sought 
amendment in the relief clause to the 
extent that the declaration be made that 
the freehold title deeds in favour of the 
defendants is not valid. They were void and 
not binding on the plaintiff. Both the 
amendments were allowed.  
 
4. 
The Trial Court, after considering the material 
on record, dismissed the Original Civil Suit 
No.16 of 1983 and partially allowed the 
counterclaim declaring that the lease deed 
dated 03.11.1975 in favour of the plaintiff was 
illegal, inoperative, and invalid. The plaintiff 
preferred first appeal registered as Original 
Civil Appeal No. 19(s) of 1999. The said first 
appeal came to be allowed vide judgment dated 
11.04.2003. Aggrieved by the same, the 
present appellants preferred a second appeal 
before the High Court. During the pendency of 
the second appeal the plaintiff Smt. Hem Prova 
Basak withdraw the Original Civil Suit No.68 of 
1995 on 08.12.2003. These facts and material 

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 14 of 18 
 
were placed before the High Court, however, 
the High Court despite noticing such facts vide 
impugned order dated 18.12.2013 dismissed 
the second appeal filed by the present 
appellants.  
5. 
While issuing notice in the present appeal on 
29.10.2014, both parties were directed to 
maintain status quo with regard to possession 
prevailing as on date. Later on, by order dated 
01.07.2016, leave was granted. The fact 
remains that the possession of the family 
members of three brothers in the house has 
continued. 
6. 
Shri Pallav Sisodia, learned senior counsel 
appearing for the appellant, apart from 
drawing our attention to the various affidavits, 
applications and orders passed on the file of 
the Sub-Divisional Officer and the Deputy 
Commissioner to show that the allotment had 
been made for the benefit of the family and not 
for one brother or his wife exclusively and that 
freehold title deeds have been subsequently 
executed in favour of the family members of all 
the three brothers, made a legal submission 

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 15 of 18 
 
that once the lease itself had been cancelled in 
1995 and the suit filed by Smt. Hem Prova 
Basak to declare the said cancellation as 
illegal, null and void having been withdrawn, 
the suit of the plaintiff for eviction and 
injunction was liable to be dismissed as the 
very basis for filing the suit stood eliminated.  
7. 
On the other hand, learned senior counsel for 
the respondent Shri Uday Gupta vehemently 
urged that the First Appellate Court and the 
High Court have examined and considered the 
material on record while decreeing the suit and 
dismissing the counterclaim, as such this 
Court may not interfere with the same under 
Article 136 of the Constitution of India and 
accordingly, dismiss this appeal.  
8. 
Having given serious consideration to the 
material on record and the submissions 
advanced, we are convinced that the suit was 
filed maliciously in order to grab the entire 
allotment and also the house constructed with 
the joint income of the three brothers. Some 
noticeable facts in this regard are summarized 
hereunder-  

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 16 of 18 
 
i) Binode Behari Basak, the eldest brother 
was 
working 
as 
Upper 
Division 
Assistant in the office of Deputy 
Commissioner, Siliguri and therefore 
had 
all 
the 
access 
in 
the 
local 
administration to favour himself and his 
wife. Initially, he had applied for 
allotment to be made in his name but 
apparently for the reason that he was 
already a government servant in the 
state of West Bengal since 1945 prior to 
the partition and migration no allotment 
would be made in his favour, he 
therefore setup his wife to become the 
applicant for the allotment.  
ii) The affidavits and the communications 
between the office of the Sub-Divisional 
Officer, the Deputy Commissioner and 
Binode Behari Basak and his wife Smt. 
Hem Prova Basak, are neither disputed 
nor denied. If that is so then it was more 
than clear that under the policy of the 
Government the allotment was being 

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 17 of 18 
 
made for the family and not for the 
individual. 
9. 
Binode Behari Basak and Hem Prova Basak 
both having admitted the said fact could not 
turn around to claim that it was their exclusive 
property. The High Court has gone completely 
wrong 
in 
ignoring 
these 
affidavits 
and 
communications giving the reason that they 
were given in a different proceeding and 
therefore would not be of relevance and any 
help to the defendants.  
10. The lease deed in the exclusive name of Smt. 
Hem Prova Basak dated 03.11.1975 having 
been cancelled and the challenge to the said 
cancellation by way of a Civil Suit No.68 of 
1995 having been withdrawn, the suit itself 
ought to have been dismissed, as the very basis 
of filing the suit was no longer in existence. The 
High Court failed to take into consideration 
this aspect of the matter thereby committing 
an error.  
11. From a perusal of the plaint, it appears that 
there has been bickering amongst the family 
members of the brothers and there were cases 

Civil Appeal No.5525 of 2016 
 
Page 18 of 18 
 
registered for maintaining tranquillity and 
peace, appears to be the reason for filing of the 
suit to deprive the two younger brothers from 
the benefit of the allotment made treating the 
family as a unit for rehabilitation.  
12. For all the reasons recorded above, the 
impugned orders passed by the High Court and 
the First Appellate Court are set aside and that 
of the Trial Court is restored. The appeal is 
allowed accordingly.
