bearing registration No. TN-72-AV-0927, which was insured with 
respondent No. 1-Insurance Company. FIR No. 442 dated 10.12.2012 was 
registered at Police Station Kalakkaadu, District Tirunelveli. A claim 
petition 4  was filed by the dependants of the deceased claiming 
compensation of ₹1,00,00,000/-. It was pleaded that the deceased was 
doing multiple activities. Besides being an agriculturist growing bananas, 
coconuts and paddy, he was also running a dairy farm and was a 
Government contractor. He was the sole bread earner of the family, who 
left behind his old mother, wife, daughter and son, who are the appellants 
before this Court. 
3.  
 
The accident and the liability of the Insurance Company as 
such are not in dispute. 
4.  
 
The only dispute raised in the present appeal is regarding the 
quantum of compensation to which the appellants are entitled to. 
5. 
 
The Tribunal, after considering the evidence led by the 
parties, opined that the income of the deceased was ₹50,000/- per month. 
Applying a cut of 1/4th for his personal expenses and adding 10% for 
future prospects, assessed total compensation towards loss of income at

₹51,04,550/-. Besides that, ₹15,000/- were awarded towards loss of estate, 
₹40,000/- towards loss of consortium and ₹15,000/- for funeral expenses. 
The total amount of compensation assessed by the Tribunal was 
₹51,64,550/-5.  Interest @8% per annum was also awarded. 
6.  
 
Aggrieved against the aforesaid award of the Tribunal, the 
Insurance Company preferred an appeal before the High Court. The main 
issue raised was regarding the income of the deceased. Accepting the 
contentions raised by the Insurance Company, the High Court reduced 
the income of the deceased from ₹50,000/- to ₹20,000/- per month. After 
adding 10% towards future prospects, application of 1/4th cut on account 
of personal expenses and after applying a multiplier of 11, the loss of 
income was assessed at ₹21,78,000/-. Adding a sum of ₹70,000/- under 
the conventional heads, compensation of ₹22,48,000/- was awarded. The 
interest awarded by the Tribunal was not disturbed. 
7. 
 
Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the High 
Court had gone wrong in reducing the amount of income of the deceased 
from ₹50,000/- to ₹20,000/- per month. There is ample evidence on record 
to show that whatever was assessed by the Tribunal was just and fair. The 
 
5  There seems to be some error in the calculation

deceased had been supplying milk and coconuts to Donavoor Santhosha 
Vidhayalaya School, from which he had received a sum of ₹8,52,447/- 
during the period from 20.09.2011 to 28.11.2012 (14 months). He was also 
growing paddy on his land from which receipt claimed was ₹7,29,900/-. 
He also received ₹16,36,398/- from sale of bananas grown on the land 
owned by him. As he was also working as a Government contractor, his 
annual income therefrom was ₹6,00,000/-. The Tribunal had already taken 
a very conservative view of the matter and assessed the income at 
₹50,000/- per month. Though the amount assessed by the Tribunal was 
not reasonable, still the appellants did not challenge the same any further. 
However, the Insurance Company, with a view to rubbing salt on the 
wounds, challenged the reasonable compensation awarded by the 
Tribunal. Sole earning member of the family had died leaving behind four 
dependants. Value of the life cannot be assessed but whatever meagre 
amount the Tribunal awarded, the appellants felt satisfied. The prayer is 
for setting aside the judgment of the High Court and to restore that of the 
Tribunal.  
8.  
 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the Insurance 
Company submitted that it is a case where unimaginable claims were 

Page 5 of 9 
 
made by the appellants. The land on which bananas were being grown is 
still there which is being used by the family for growing the same, hence 
there is no loss of income on that account. There is no clinching evidence 
on record to show that the deceased was working as a Government 
contractor regularly and the income was being generated therefrom. 
Total receipts from supply of milk and coconuts to the school cannot be 
said to be the income. The High Court had taken a reasonable view as 
compensation to be awarded to the dependants of a deceased has to be 
just and reasonable and not the kind of bonanza. There is no error in the 
judgment of the High Court. The appeal deserves to be dismissed. 
9.  
 
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the 
relevant referred record. 
10.   
The basic facts, namely, the date of accident, the age of the 
deceased and dependency are not in dispute. There is no dispute on the 
negligence part also. The only issue sought to be raised is with reference 
to the assessment of the income of the deceased.  
11.   
From the material placed on record by the appellants, it is 
evident that besides generating income from the land owned by the 
family in the form of sale of paddy and bananas, the deceased was also 

Page 6 of 9 
 
having income from supply of milk and coconuts to the school. There is 
also material available on record to show that he worked as a Government 
contractor. Meaning thereby, to make the lives of his family members 
comfortable, the deceased was multi-tasking and he was not engaged in 
a 9.00 to 5.00 P.M. job. 
12.   
From the material available on record, in the form of Ex. P12 
(receipt issued by the school) and Ex. P13 (bank account statement of the 
deceased) and statement of PW3-Thiru. Ponraj (Principal of the School), 
the deceased received a sum of ₹8,52,447/- from the school for the period 
from 20.09.2011 to 28.11.2012 (14 months) on account of supply of milk 
and coconuts. Though the entire amount received by the deceased from 
the school on account of supply of milk and coconuts cannot be said to be 
his income but it proves that he was engaged in this business.  
13.   
As far as the income from the agriculture is concerned, the 
appellants claimed that the deceased was the only person in the family 
who was taking care of the land. His share in the land was 07 acres and 47 
cents though the family owned 27 acres and 78 cents. He was growing 
bananas and paddy. It was claimed that his receipts therefrom was 
₹23,66,298/-. Though part of the aforesaid land was said to be wet land, 

Page 7 of 9 
 
hence not cultivable but it came in evidence of RW3-Thiru. Ramasamy, 
Village Administrative Officer, that after the death of Ravi Shankar in the 
accident in question, the land is not being cultivated. Meaning thereby, 
on account of the death of the deceased, the income from the land must 
have been reduced. The appellants had claimed receipts on that account 
to the tune of ₹25,00,000/-. Further, Thiru. Kalayana Sundram, Income Tax 
Officer, appeared as RW2. He stated that the deceased did not pay 
income tax of ₹1,48,598/- for the year 2010-11. There is also evidence on 
record to show that the deceased received ₹22,23,553/- from Tirunelveli 
Municipal Corporation for execution of a works contract during the year 
2011-12. 
14.   
The High Court on a very conservative basis assessed the 
income of the deceased at ₹20,000/- per month, bifurcating the same at 
₹8,000/- per month for supply of milk to the school, ₹5,000/- per month 
from agriculture and ₹7,000/- per month from working as a contractor. In 
our opinion, considering the material placed on record by the appellants, 
income of the deceased deserves to be re-assessed as it is established 
that he was doing multiple works. It also came on record that after his 
death, the land was lying barren and was not being cultivated.

 Assessment 
of 
compensation 
cannot 
be 
done 
with 
mathematical precision. The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 also provides for 
assessment of just and fair compensation. In our opinion, considering the 
material placed on record by the appellants, as has been referred to 
above, and value of the labour being put in by the deceased in 
agriculture, it would be reasonable to assess his income at ₹35,000/- per 
month. Considering his age at the time of death as 52 years on the date of 
accident, the applicable multiplier would be 11 as per the judgment of 
this Court in Sarla Verma (Smt.) and others v. Delhi Transport 
Corporation and another 6   approved by this Court in National 
Insurance Company Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi and others7. 
16. 
 
Hence, the compensation on the basis of income assessed by 
this Court would be as under:

Amount (in ₹)

Thus, the appellants are found entitled to compensation of 
₹38,81,500/- with interest @8% from the date of filing of the claim petition 
till realization. Ordered accordingly.  The judgment of the High Court is 
modified to the extent mentioned above. 
18.   
The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
