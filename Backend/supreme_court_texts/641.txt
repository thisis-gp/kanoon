1. 
The Appellant (hereinafter referred to as 
“Appellant-Company”) is assailing the Order 
dated 15.09.2023, wherein the High Court of 
Gujarat 
dismissed 
the 
Criminal

Application No. 783 of 2017 (hereinafter referred 
to as “CRA No. 783 of 2017”) moved under

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 2 of 17 
 
discharge application moved by the Appellant-
Company. The said application was dismissed 
by 
the 
learned 
Special 
Judge 
(CBI) 
at 
Ahmedabad (hereinafter referred to as “Special 
Judge”) vide Order dated 19.07.2017. 
2. 
It is alleged by the Central Bureau of 
Investigation, 
being 
Respondent 
No. 
01 
(hereinafter 
referred 
to 
as 
“Respondent-
Agency”), that the Appellant-Company had 
entered into a criminal conspiracy with Shri 
Yogendra 
Garg, 
Joint 
Development 
Commissioner, Kandla Special Economic Zone, 
Kandla (hereinafter referred to as “KASEZ”), and 
Shri V.N. Jahagirdar, Deputy Commissioner of 
Customs, KASEZ, between the period from 
March 2001 to August 2004. It is alleged that 
the latter officials perverted their official 
positions and allowed the Appellant-Company 
to clear its goods into the Indian Market on 
payment of Countervailing Duty (hereinafter 
referred to as “CVD”) on the invoice value of the 
concerned goods, rather than the payment of 
the CVD on the Maximum Retail Price 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 3 of 17 
 
(hereinafter referred to as “MRP”) of the said 
goods, thereby causing a wrongful gain to 
themselves and a corresponding wrongful loss 
to the Government exchequer to the tune of INR 
8,00,00,000/- (Rupees Eight Crores only). 
3. 
Before pursuing the aftermath of the allegations 
by the Respondent-Agency, it is crucial to delve 
into the backdrop in which the allegations arose 
against the Appellant-Company. 
4. 
The Appellant-Company claims to be a private 
limited company duly incorporated under the 
Companies Act, 1956, which is engaged in 
manufacturing and exporting of cosmetics and 
toilet preparations and having one of its units in 
KASEZ. As per the Appellant-Company, its 
products get cleared from the KASEZ Unit into 
the Domestic Tariff Area (hereinafter referred to 
as “DTA”) in consonance with the necessary 
permissions granted to it by the appropriate 
authority. It is its case that it had effected the 
following three kinds of clearances from its 
KASEZ Unit into the DTA, being (a) Clearances 
of goods weighing or containing less than 20 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 4 of 17 
 
gram or 20 millilitre, (b) products containing 
alcohol, and (c) other goods in “Wholesale 
Packs”. 
5. 
From August 2004 onwards, Officers of the 
Kandla 
Customs 
(hereinafter 
referred 
as 
“Revenue Authorities”) moved against the 
Appellant-Company, alleging that they had 
escaped payment of CVD on the aforementioned 
clearances on account of non-disclosure of MRP 
as per the provisions of the Standards of 
Weights and Measures Act, 1976 (hereinafter 
referred to as “SWM Act 1976”) as they had 
declared only the invoice value of the said goods. 
This was a violation of the proviso to Section 3(2) 
of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 (hereinafter 
referred to as “CT Act 1975”) read with Section 
4A(2) 
of 
the 
Central 
Excise 
Act, 
1944 
(hereinafter referred to as “CE Act 1944”), and 
on the said ground, goods being cleared by the 
Appellant-Company 
into 
the 
DTA 
were 
intercepted. The Revenue Authorities issued 
Show 
Cause 
Notices 
dated 
03.11.2004, 
10.11.2004, 
and 
10.02.2005 
(along 
with 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 5 of 17 
 
Corrigendum dated 11.03.2005) under Section 
28 of the Customs Act, 1962 (hereinafter 
referred to as “CA 1962”), under Section 11A of 
the CE Act 1944, and under Section 124 of CA 
1962 respectively. 
6. 
Thereafter, pursuant to the said allegation 
based on source information to Respondent-
Agency, 
First 
Information 
Report 
bearing 
number RC-6(A)/2005-GNR under Section 
120B read with Section 420 of the Indian Penal 
Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as “IPC 
1860”) and Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of 
Corruption Act, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as 
“PCA 1998”) was registered on 04.04.2005 at 
Gandhinagar branch of Respondent-Agency 
(hereinafter referred to as “the FIR”). A raid is 
also claimed to have been conducted on the 
KASEZ Unit of the Appellant-Company by the 
Respondent-Agency. 
7. 
Eventually, Assessment Orders were passed 
observing the non-declaration of MRP on the 
concerned goods by the Appellant-Company. 
These Assessment Orders were assailed by the 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 6 of 17 
 
Appellant-Company before the Commissioner of 
Customs (Appeals), Kandla by filing of appeals, 
which resulted in the passing of Orders dated 
09.05.2005 and 30.06.2005. The Commissioner 
of Customs (Appeals), Kandla observed that the 
concerned goods were ought to be assessed 
under Section 3(2) of the CT Act 1975 as 
opposed to the proviso to the said provision. 
Furthermore, declaration of MRP is necessary 
on packages intended for retail sale and not for 
bigger packages for wholesale trade. The 
Revenue Authorities were directed to consider 
the case of the concerned goods of the 
Appellant-Company afresh in light of the 
observations made in the said Orders. 
8. 
In the meanwhile, a clarification was sought 
from the Office of the Collector of Legal 
Metrology and Director of Consumer Affairs by 
the Appellant-Company in the said regard and 
it was responded vide Letter dated 04.01.2006 
wherein, the view taken by the Appellant-
Company by placing reliance on Rule 29 of the 
Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 7 of 17 
 
Commodities) Rules, 1977 (hereinafter referred 
to as “Packaged Commodities Rules 1977”) was 
affirmed. 
9. 
Placing reliance on the Letter dated 04.01.2006 
and other materials on record, the Appellant-
Company moved three applications before the 
Settlement Commission and immunity was 
granted to it under the CE Act 1944, CA 1962, 
and IPC 1860 vide Common Order No. 
248/Final 
Order/CEX/KNA/2007 
dated 
21.08.2007. 
10. The Investigation Officer, thereafter, was 
pleased to move a Closure Report dated 
05.03.2008 before the learned Special Judge. 
The Court, however, rejected the said Closure 
Report vide order dated 01.06.2010, and 
instead directed for registration of a Special 
Case against the accused persons, including 
the Appellant-Company. This case came to be 
registered as CBI Special Case No. 48 of 2010. 
11. The Appellant-Company moved the High Court 
of Gujarat by filing a Special Criminal 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 8 of 17 
 
Application challenging the above Order which 
was dismissed on 12.12.2011. Aggrieved, the 
Appellant-Company moved this Court through 
filing of Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 
14430 of 2013. This Court was pleased to 
condone the delay in filing, but while 
dismissing the petition vide Order dated 
26.07.2013 observed that only cognizance had 
been taken by the learned Special Judge and 
directed 
issuance 
of 
summons 
to 
the 
Appellant-Company, and thereby, it was not an 
appropriate stage to interfere. However, liberty 
was granted to the Appellant-Company to 
pursue and plead for discharge at the time of 
hearing of charges. 
12. In pursuance of the said liberty, the Appellant-
Company moved an application for discharge 
before the learned Special Judge. One of the 
grounds was that the Appellant-Company had 
been granted immunity under the CE Act 
1944, CA 1962, and IPC 1860 through Order 
dated 20.08.2007 passed by the competent 
authority, i.e., the Settlement Commission and 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 9 of 17 
 
pressed into service the observations made by 
this Court in General Officer Commanding, 
Rashtriya Rifles v. CBI1 and Another, 
Jamuna Singh and Others v. Bhadai Shah2, 
and Devarapalli Lakshminarayana Reddy 
and Others v. V. Narayana Reddy and 
Others3 to the effect that mere filing of FIR with 
the police, which is subsequently forwarded to 
the Court, does not amount to institution of 
prosecution. Furthermore, that the Appellant-
Company is not a “public servant” vis-à-vis 
Section 13(1)(b) read with Section 13(2) of the 
PCA 1998. Besides this, the Court had already 
refused 
to 
accept 
contentions 
of 
the 
Respondent-Agency against Shri Yogendra 
Garg for sanction under Section 197 of the 
CrPC 1973, and henceforth, the Appellant-
Company cannot be prosecuted alone for the 
charge under Section 120B of IPC 1860, and it 
finally put forth that the offences under Section 
                                              
1 (2012) 6 SCC 228 
2 1963 SCC OnLine SC 263 
3 (1976) 3 SCC 252 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 10 of 17 
 
420 read with Section 120B of IPC 1860 are not 
made out as against the Appellant. 
13. The learned Special Judge, however, disagreed  
Company and dismissed the said application 
vide Order dated 19.07.2017. To substantiate 
its dismissal, the Court with reference to the 
CE Act 1944, observed that as per Section 
4A(1), it transpires that the retail price of the 
concerned goods is to be declared, which 
through reliance on Circular dated 01.03.2001 
and the concerned provisions of law, is 
interpreted as declaration of MRP. 
14. It is against the said Order dated 19.07.2017 
that the Appellant-Company had moved the 
High Court of Gujarat in CRA No. 783 of 2017 
which eventually led to the passing of the 
Impugned Order dated 15.09.2023. During the 
pendency of the CRA No. 783 of 2017, the High 
Court of Gujarat stayed further proceedings 
before the Special Judge while issuing notice to 
the Respondent-Agency vide Order dated 
18.08.2017. It was brought to the attention of 
the High Court that the Appellant-Company 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 11 of 17 
 
had paid a total of INR 1,51,45,378/- (Rupees 
One Crore Fifty One Lakhs Forty Five 
Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy Eight 
only) during the investigation by the Revenue 
Authorities and admittedly, in light of the 
Orders dated 09.05.2005 and 30.06.2005, the 
Appellant-Company had become entitled to a 
refund instead.  
15. While passing the Impugned Order dated 
15.09.2023, the High Court of Gujarat 
disagreed 
with 
the 
contentions 
of 
the 
Appellant-Company, 
and 
affirmed 
the 
contentions of the Respondent-Agency.  
16. It is in this backdrop that the Appellant-
Company moved this Court in Special Leave 
Petition (Civil) No. 13422 of 2023 by reiterating 
its earlier contentions. On the first date of 
hearing, our attention was drawn to the Order 
dated 
09.05.2005 
of 
the 
Office 
of 
Commissioner of Customs (Appeals) which had 
directed that the matter be remanded to the 
assessing authority for fresh assessment. No 
further development is there in the case of the 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 12 of 17 
 
Appellant-Company. Accordingly, vide Order 
dated 16.10.2023, proceedings before the Trial 
Court were stayed. The Respondent-Agency, 
too, filed their contentions as part of its 
Counter Affidavit dated 19.04.2024. 
17. Having heard the counsels for both the parties 
at length, it is pertinent to consider the 
concerned provisions of law before we delve 
into the legal and factual facet. 
18. Predominantly, the argument of the Appellant-
Company pertained to having been granted 
immunity by Settlement Commission vide 
Order dated 20.08.2007 as per Section 32K of 
the CE Act 1944. A perusal of the powers of the 
Settlement Commission leads us to equivalent 
provision under the CA 1962 through Section 
127H. Both the provisions are pari materia to 
each other and bear the same text. These 
sections provide for an explicit bar from 
prosecution on grant of immunity in cases 
where the proceedings for any offence have 
been instituted subsequent to the date of 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 13 of 17 
 
receipt of the application 
seeking such 
immunity under the relevant law.  
19. A perusal of the scheme of the CrPC 1973 
allows us to infer that mere registration of FIR 
cannot be interpreted to mean that it 
constitutes the initiation of such proceedings. 
A 
registration 
of 
FIR 
necessitates 
an 
investigation by a competent officer as per the 
detailed process outlined in Sections 155 to 
176. It is only after a Final Report (or as 
referred in the common parlance, a Challan or 
a Chargesheet) is submitted as per the 
compliance of Section 173(2) of CrPC 1973, 
cognizance for the offence(s) concerned is 
taken. However, undoubtedly, the Court is not 
bound by the said report.  
The cardinal principle that investigation and 
taking of cognizance operate in parallel 
channels, without an intermingling, and in 
different areas was also laid down by this Court 
in H.N. Rishbud v. State (Delhi Admn.)4 and 
                                              
4 (1954) 2 SCC 934 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 14 of 17 
 
further 
elaborated 
and 
reiterated 
in 
Abhinandan Jha and Others v. Dinesh 
Mishra5 and State of Orissa v. Habibullah 
Khan6. 
20. In Hira Lal Hari Lal Bhagwati v. CBI, New 
Delhi7, even though the subject matter of the 
dispute pertained to Kar Vivad Samadhan 
Scheme, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as “KVSS 
1998”), the observations of this Court came to 
the rescue of the Assessee-Company therein. 
As per the said factual matrix, the case of the 
Assessee-Company therein was settled under 
the KVSS 1998 on 10.02.1999 by the 
Designated Authority and as per the terms of 
the settlement, the Assessee-Company therein 
withdrew the appeal before this Court on 
16.03.1999 and a certificate for full and final 
settlement was issued on 19.07.1999. Despite 
that, on 06.01.1999, a case was registered as 
against the Appellant therein in capacity as the 
office bearer of the Assessee-Company. It was 
                                              
5 1967 SCC OnLine SC 107 
6 2003 SCC OnLine SC 1411 
7 (2003) 5 SCC 257 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 15 of 17 
 
held by this Court that continuation of such a 
prosecution would be inconsistent with the 
intent and provisions of the law. The Appellant 
therein was also obliged to withdraw the appeal 
before this Court, which might have had also 
impacted 
the 
merits 
of 
the 
criminal 
proceedings as against them. 
21. The above ratio, as laid down by this Court, 
would be fully applicable to the case-at-hand, 
especially when it is not in dispute that the 
Commissioner of Customs (Appeals), Kandla 
returned a finding that the Appellant-Company 
was not required to pay the CVD on the basis 
of MRP, but as per the invoice value. This is in 
consonance with the submission of the 
Appellant-Company.  
On remand to the Assessing Authority for 
decision afresh on the liability, it had observed 
that the Appellant-Company was entitled to a 
refund of INR 1.39 Crores out of the INR 
1,51,45,378/- (Rupees One Crore Fifty One 
Lakhs 
Forty 
Five 
Thousand 
and 
Three 
Hundred Seventy Eight only) paid by it to the 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 16 of 17 
 
Revenue Authorities as per the demand made 
earlier for the purpose of clearance of the 
concerned goods. This position is also admitted 
by the Respondent-Agency in its Counter 
Affidavit dated 19.04.2024. Moreover, the said 
Order was never challenged by the Revenue 
Authorities, and has, thus, attained finality. 
22. Furthermore, the Appellant-Company had 
successfully 
claimed 
immunity 
from 
prosecution under the CA 1962, CE Act 1944, 
and IPC 1860 vide Order dated 21.08.2007. In 
such a circumstance, there was no fiscal 
liability on the Appellant-Company, and 
accordingly, the Order dated 01.08.2010 
passed by learned Special Judge, taking 
cognizance against the Appellant-Company, 
ought not to have sustained. As the very basis 
of the allegation of offence against the 
Appellant-Company was found to be non-
existent, it would have amounted to misuse 
rather abuse of the process of law. It may be 
added here that the prosecution sanction as 
sought against the officials of KASEZ, who were 

Criminal Appeal No. 3216 of 2024                    Page 17 of 17 
 
said to have committed the offences under PCA 
1988, stood declined. In the light of this 
additional fact, the application for discharge, 
as moved by the Appellant-Company, ought to 
have been accepted by the learned Special 
Judge. 
23. In light of the above, the present Appeal is 
allowed. 
The 
proceedings 
against 
the 
Appellant-Company are quashed by setting 
aside the Impugned Order dated 15.09.2023 
passed by the High Court of Gujarat in CRA No. 
783 of 2017 and the Order dated 01.06.2010 
passed by the Special Judge in RC6(A)/2005. 
24. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
