The present appeals challenge the judgments and orders 
dated 22nd December 2023 and 12th January 2024 passed by 
the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Gwalior in Writ Petition 
Nos. 23998 and 23437 of 2023, and 23060 of 2023 
respectively.  By the said writ petitions, the writ petitioners

(appellants herein) had challenged the decision of the 
Respondent-Department of Medical Education of not allotting 
MBBS Unreserved (UR) Category Government School (GS) 
quota seats to the meritorious reserved candidates, who had 
passed from the Government Schools.  The appellants had also 
prayed for a direction to the Respondent-Department to allot 
the MBBS seats of Unreserved Category Government School 
quota to the appellants.  
3. 
Writ petitioners in Writ Petition No. 23060 of 2023 before 
the High Court have approached this Court by way of appeals 
arising out of Special Leave Petition (SLP) (Civil) Nos. 2111 and 
2285 of 2024, and writ petitioners in Writ Petition Nos. 23437 
and 23998 of 2023 have approached this Court by way of 
appeals arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 2311-2312 of 2024.  
4. 
Since the facts giving rise to the present appeals as given 
below are identical and same, the said appeals are decided by 
the common judgment and order.  
4.1 On 19th June 2019, the amendment by the State 
Government to the Madhya Pradesh Education Admission 
Rules, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as the “Admission Rules, 
2018”) were notified. In place of sub-rules (l) and (u) of rule 2 

3 
 
and sub-rule (2) of rule 4, new sub-rules were established that 
defined “category” and the method to fill vacancies for category 
wise reservation was established. 
4.2 On 7th May 2023, the NEET (UG) Examination was 
conducted in which the appellants had participated in. 
4.3 On 10th May 2023, the State of Madhya Pradesh notified 
another amendment in the Admission Rules, 2018. Sub-rule 
(f) and (b) were added to Rule 2 that defined “Government 
School” and the students who could fall under the category of 
“Government School Students”. A new table in existing clause 
(b) of Schedule-2 detailing the quantum of reservations was 
added in which 5% of the total seats were reserved for 
government school students.  
4.4 Subsequently, the results of NEET (UG) were declared on 
13th June 2023. Then, on 25th July 2023, an advisory was 
issued notifying that the Admission Rules, 2018 and the 
amendment thereto dated 10th May 2023 would apply to the 
counselling process. 
4.5 A chart showing the names of the appellants, marks 
obtained by them in NEET UG – 2023, their categories and 
their details in the appeals, are as under:

4.6 Thereafter, on 22nd August 2023, the State/Respondents 
issued the seat wise distribution of medical colleges at the end 
of the 2nd round of counselling. Since several seats remained 
vacant according to Rule 2 (g) of the Admission Rules, 2018, 
the vacancies were transferred from one category to other 
categories. In the instant case, out of 89 unreserved seats for 
Government School students, 77 were sent to the open 
category. 

5 
 
4.7 Being aggrieved by the fact that the vacant seats were 
going to be released to the unreserved category, the aforesaid 
writ petitions were filed by the appellants before the High 
Court, where it was prayed that the meritorious students of 
reserved category who have studied in Government Schools 
must be allotted MBBS seats of unreserved category 
government school quota before they are released to the open 
category.  
4.8 The High Court, vide order dated 31st October 2023 
dismissed a Writ Petition filed by another candidate seeking 
similar relief as aforementioned. The High Court in the Writ 
Petition being WP No. 23060 of 2023 filed by the appellants in 
an interim order dated 8th November 2023 took note of the 
earlier order dated 31st October 2023 and recorded that no 
prima facie case was made out and adjourned the matter to 
permit the appellants to make additional arguments. The said 
order dated 8th November 2023 was challenged before this 
Court vide SLP (C) No. 25963 of 2023, wherein this Court vide 
order dated 28th November 2023 directed the High Court to 
decide the petition on merits or the question of interim relief 
at the earliest, preferably within 2 weeks. 

6 
 
4.9 Ultimately, on 22nd December 2023, the Indore Bench 
and on 12th January 2024 the Gwalior Bench of the High Court 
vide the impugned judgments and orders dismissed the writ 
petitions finding the same sans merits.  
4.10 The impugned judgments and orders came to be 
challenged before this Court and after hearing all the parties, 
this Court vide order dated 12th August 2024 reserved the 
judgment and by way of an ad-interim order directed the 
respondent/State to keep seven seats vacant in MBBS course, 
so that in the event the appellants succeed, they can be 
accommodated against the said seats. 
5. 
We have heard Shri K. Parameshwar, learned Senior 
Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants and Shri 
Nachiketa Joshi, learned Additional Advocate General (AAG) 
appearing on behalf of the respondents. 
6. 
Shri Parameshwar, learned Senior Counsel appearing on 
behalf of the appellants submitted that the GS quota was 
introduced by the State of Madhya Pradesh on 10th May 2023.  
However, the procedure followed by the respondents in sub-
classifying the candidates further into categories as UR-GS, 
SC-GS, ST-GS, OBC-GS and EWS-GS was totally illegal.  It is 

7 
 
submitted that, in view of the settled position of law as laid 
down by this Court in the case of Saurav Yadav and Others 
v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others1, even in case of 
horizontal reservation, the candidates from the reserved 
categories like SC/ST/OBC, if they are entitled on their own 
merit in the GS quota, will have to be admitted against the GS 
quota (UR seats). He submitted that, on account of erroneous 
application of policy, an anomalous situation has arisen 
wherein, in the UR-GS seats, the persons who are much less 
meritorious than the appellants, who have secured as low as 
214, 150 marks, have secured admission, whereas the 
appellants, who are much more meritorious than the UR-GS 
candidates have been deprived the admission.  It is submitted 
that the cut-off for UR-GS was 291, OBC-GS was 465, SC-GS 
was 314 and EWS-GS was 428.  He therefore submitted that, 
on account of erroneous application of the policy, as many as 
77 seats classified as UR-GS, were not filled from the GS quota 
and had to be released to the open pool of candidates.  
7. 
Shri Parameshwar further submitted that the State, 
realizing its mistake, has now carried out an amendment on 
 
1 (2021) 4 SCC 542 : 2020 INSC 714 

8 
 
2nd July 2024 thereby intending to apply horizontal 
reservation correctly for this academic year in accordance with 
the judgment and decision of this Court in the case of Saurav 
Yadav (supra). 
8. 
To meet the situation of the admission for the Academic 
Session 2023-24 which being already complete, the learned 
Senior Counsel, relying on the judgment of this Court in the 
case of S. Krishna Sradha v. State of Andhra Pradesh and 
Others2, submitted that the Court should mould the relief and 
direct the admission to be granted to the appellants in the next 
academic session by issuing appropriate directions. 
9. 
Shri Joshi, learned AAG appearing on behalf of the 
respondents submitted that, since the reservation in the GS 
category was horizontal, the State was justified in making a 
further sub-classification into OBC-GS, ST-GS, SC-GS, UR-
GS and EWS-GS. He submitted that, since it was a case of 
horizontal reservation, it was not possible to shift the category 
of vertical reservation like the SC/ST/OBC/EWS to the 
horizontal category of UR-GS. 
 
2 (2020) 17 SCC 465 : 2019 INSC 1362 

9 
 
10. By now, it is a well-settled principle of law that a 
candidate belonging to any of the vertical reservation 
categories who on the basis of his own merit is entitled to be 
selected in the open or general category, will be selected 
against the general category and his selection would not be 
counted against the quota reserved for such vertical 
reservation categories. Reliance in this respect could be placed 
on the 9-Judge Bench judgment of this Court in the case of 
Indra Sawhney and Others v. Union of India and Others3, 
and in the cases of R.K. Sabharwal and Others v. State of 
Punjab and Others4  and Ritesh R. Sah v. Dr. Y.L. Yamul 
and Others5. 
11. However, this Court, in the case of Saurav Yadav 
(supra), had an occasion to consider for the first time as to 
whether the said principle laid down in the case of Indra 
Sawhney (supra) and followed subsequently would also apply 
to the cases of horizontal reservation. Prior to the said 
judgment, there were conflicting views of different High 
Courts. 
This 
Court, 
after 
surveying 
various 
earlier 
 
3 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 
4 (1995) 2 SCC 745 : 1995 INSC 108 
5 (1996) 3 SCC 253 : 1996 INSC 258 

10 
 
pronouncements and considering the views as expressed by 
the High Courts, observed thus: 
“43. Finally, we must say that the steps indicated by 
the High Court of Gujarat in para 69 of its judgment 
in Tamannaben 
Ashokbhai 
Desai [Tamannaben 
Ashokbhai Desai v. Shital Amrutlal Nishar, 2020 SCC 
OnLine Guj 2592] contemplate the correct and 
appropriate procedure for considering and giving 
effect to both vertical and horizontal reservations. 
The illustration given by us deals with only one 
possible dimension. There could be multiple such 
possibilities. Even going by the present illustration, 
the first female candidate allocated in the vertical 
column for Scheduled Tribes may have secured 
higher position than the candidate at Serial No. 64. 
In that event said candidate must be shifted from the 
category of Scheduled Tribes to Open/General 
category causing a resultant vacancy in the vertical 
column of Scheduled Tribes. Such vacancy must 
then enure to the benefit of the candidate in the 
waiting list for Scheduled Tribes-Female. The steps 
indicated by the Gujarat High Court will take care of 
every such possibility. It is true that the exercise of 
laying down a procedure must necessarily be left to 
the authorities concerned but we may observe that 
one set out in said judgment will certainly satisfy all 
claims and will not lead to any incongruity as 
highlighted by us in the preceding paragraphs.” 
 
 
12. It could thus be seen that, this Court approved the steps 
indicated by the High Court of Gujarat in paragraph 69 of its 
judgment in the case of Tamannaben Ashokbhai Desai v. 
Shital Amrutlal Nishar6 for considering and giving effect to 
 
6 2020 SCC OnLine Guj 2592 

11 
 
both vertical and horizontal reservations. In the said case, this 
Court was considering horizontal reservation for the female 
candidates. It was observed that a meritorious reserved 
category candidate who is entitled to the General category of 
the said horizontal reservation on his own merit, will have to 
be allotted a seat from the said General category of the 
horizontal reservation. Meaning thereby such a candidate 
cannot be counted in a horizontal seat reserved for the 
category of vertical reservation like SC/ST.   
13. It will also be apposite to refer to the following 
observations made by S. Ravindra Bhat, J. in his concurring 
judgment: 
“66. I would conclude by saying that reservations, 
both vertical and horizontal, are method of ensuring 
representation in public services. These are not to 
be seen as rigid “slots”, where a candidate's merit, 
which otherwise entitles her to be shown in the 
open general category, is foreclosed, as the 
consequence would be, if the State's argument is 
accepted. Doing so, would result in a communal 
reservation, where each social category is 
confined within the extent of their reservation, 
thus negating merit. The open category is open to 
all, and the only condition for a candidate to be 
shown in it is merit, regardless of whether 
reservation benefit of either type is available to 
her or him.” 
[emphasis supplied] 
 

12 
 
14. It could thus be seen that the learned Judge clearly 
observed that the horizontal as well as the vertical reservation 
would not be seen as rigid “slots”, where a candidate's merit, 
which otherwise entitles her or him to be shown in the open 
general category, is foreclosed.  It was observed that by doing 
so, it would result in communal reservation, where each social 
category is confined within the extent of their reservation, thus 
negating merit. It was observed that the open category is open 
to all, and the only condition for a candidate to be shown in it 
is merit, regardless of whether reservation benefit of either 
type is available to her or him.  
15. The said view was reiterated by this Court in the case of 
Sadhana Singh Dangi and Others v. Pinki Asati and 
Others7. 
16. In view of the settled position of law as laid down by this 
Court in the case of Saurav Yadav (supra) and reiterated in 
the case of Sadhana Singh Dangi (supra), the methodology 
adopted by the respondents in compartmentalizing the 
different categories in the horizontal reservation and 
restricting the migration of the meritorious reserved category 
 
7 (2022) 12 SCC 401 : 2021 INSC 907 

13 
 
candidates to the unreserved seats is totally unsustainable.  In 
view of the law laid down by this Court, the meritorious 
candidates belonging to SC/ST/OBC, who on their own merit, 
were entitled to be selected against the UR-GS quota, have 
been denied the seats against the open seats in the GS quota.  
17. It is to be noted that, in the present case, the cut-off for 
UR candidates was much less as compared to the cut-off for 
SC/ST/OBC/EWS candidates. As such, the respondents 
ought to have admitted the present appellants against the UR-
GS categories.  It is further to be noted that many seats from 
UR-GS category were required to be transferred to the General 
category. 
18. Having held that the appellants were deprived of their 
legitimate claim of admission against the UR-GS category in 
the Academic Session 2023-24, and since the admission 
process for the said academic session is complete, we will have 
to consider as to what relief should be granted in favour of the 
appellants.   
19. It will be apposite to refer to the observations made by 
this Court in the judgment of S. Krishna Sradha (supra), 
which read thus: 

14 
 
“13. In light of the discussion/observations made 
hereinabove, a meritorious candidate/student who 
has been denied an admission in MBBS course 
illegally or irrationally by the authorities for no fault 
of his/her and who has approached the Court in time 
and so as to see that such a meritorious candidate 
may not have to suffer for no fault of his/her, we 
answer the reference as under: 
13.1. That in a case where candidate/student has 
approached the court at the earliest and without any 
delay and that the question is with respect to the 
admission in medical course all the efforts shall be 
made by the court concerned to dispose of the 
proceedings by giving priority and at the earliest. 
13.2. Under exceptional circumstances, if the court 
finds that there is no fault attributable to the 
candidate and the candidate has pursued his/her 
legal right expeditiously without any delay and there 
is fault only on the part of the authorities and/or 
there is apparent breach of rules and regulations as 
well as related principles in the process of grant of 
admission which would violate the right of equality 
and equal treatment to the competing candidates and 
if the time schedule prescribed — 30th September, is 
over, to do the complete justice, the Court under 
exceptional circumstances and in rarest of rare cases 
direct the admission in the same year by directing to 
increase the seats, however, it should not be more 
than one or two seats and such admissions can be 
ordered within reasonable time i.e. within one month 
from 30th September i.e. cut-off date and under no 
circumstances, the Court shall order any admission 
in the same year beyond 30th October. However, it is 
observed that such relief can be granted only in 
exceptional circumstances and in the rarest of rare 
cases. In case of such an eventuality, the Court may 
also pass an order cancelling the admission given to 
a candidate who is at the bottom of the merit list of 
the category who, if the admission would have been 
given to a more meritorious candidate who has been 
denied admission illegally, would not have got the 

15 
 
admission, if the Court deems it fit and proper, 
however, after giving an opportunity of hearing to a 
student whose admission is sought to be cancelled. 
13.3. In case the Court is of the opinion that no relief 
of admission can be granted to such a candidate in 
the very academic year and wherever it finds that the 
action of the authorities has been arbitrary and in 
breach of the rules and regulations or the prospectus 
affecting the rights of the students and that a 
candidate is found to be meritorious and such 
candidate/student has approached the court at the 
earliest and without any delay, the court can mould 
the relief and direct the admission to be granted to 
such a candidate in the next academic year by 
issuing appropriate directions by directing to 
increase in the number of seats as may be considered 
appropriate in the case and in case of such an 
eventuality and if it is found that the management 
was at fault and wrongly denied the admission to the 
meritorious candidate, in that case, the Court may 
direct to reduce the number of seats in the 
management quota of that year, meaning thereby the 
student/students who was/were denied admission 
illegally to be accommodated in the next academic 
year out of the seats allotted in the management 
quota. 
13.4. Grant of the compensation could be an 
additional 
remedy 
but 
not 
a 
substitute 
for 
restitutional remedies. Therefore, in an appropriate 
case the Court may award the compensation to such 
a meritorious candidate who for no fault of his/her 
has to lose one full academic year and who could not 
be granted any relief of admission in the same 
academic year.” 
 
20. Undisputedly, the appellants who were meritorious and 
who could have been admitted against the UR-GS category 
were denied admission on account of an erroneous application 

16 
 
of the methodology in applying the horizontal and vertical 
reservation.  It is also not in dispute that many of the students, 
who secured much less marks than the appellants, have been 
admitted against the UR-GS seats. This is totally in 
contravention of the law laid down by this Court in the cases 
of Saurav Yadav (supra) and Sadhana Singh Dangi (supra).  
We therefore find that as held by this Court in the case of S. 
Krishna Sradha (supra), it will be appropriate to issue 
directions to the respondents to admit the appellants in the 
next Academic Session 2024-25 against the UR-GS seats.  
Vide order dated 12th August 2024, we have already directed 7 
seats to be kept vacant in the event the appellants succeed.  
The appellants can be very well accommodated against the 
said seats. 
21. In the rest, we pass the following order: 
(i) 
The appeals are allowed; 
(ii) 
The impugned judgments and orders dated 22nd 
December 2023 and 12th January 2024 passed by the 
High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Gwalior in Writ 
Petition Nos. 23998 and 23437 of 2023, and 23060 of 
2023 respectively are quashed and set aside; and 

17 
 
(iii) The respondents are directed to admit the appellants 
herein in the next Academic Session i.e. 2024-25 for 
MBBS Course against the seats reserved for UR-GS 
category. 
22. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.  No 
costs.
