section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 19551 along 
with all pending applications, with costs of Rs. 
1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only). By the same 
common order, the MAT.APP. (F.C) 120/2019 filed by 
the Wife is allowed to the extent that the interim 
maintenance granted to the Wife under Section 24 of 
the HMA is enhanced from Rs.1,15,000/-(Rupees one 
lakh fifteen thousand only) to Rs.1,45,000/- (Rupees 
one lakh forty five thousand only)  per month from 
the date of filing of enhancement application.  
 
3. 
The parties were married as per Hindu rites and 
ceremonies on 13.12.1998 and have one son born 
from their wedlock on 28.05.2001. However, the 
marital relationship soured and the parties began 
living separately from January, 2004. Since the date 
of separation, the son has been residing with the 
respondent–wife. Subsequently, on 11.05.2004, the 
appellant–husband filed a petition under Section 
13(1)(ia) of the HMA, before the Family Court seeking 
divorce on the ground of cruelty. During the 
pendency of the divorce petition, the respondent, on 
27.05.2004, filed an application under Section 24 of 
 
1 HMA 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 3 of 29 
 
the HMA seeking pendente lite maintenance for 
herself and the son. This application was disposed of 
by the Family Court vide order dated 20.09.2004, 
directing the appellant to pay a cumulative sum of 
₹18,000/- (Rupees eighteen thousand only) per 
month, 
comprising 
₹15,000/- 
(Rupees 
fifteen 
thousand only) to the respondent and ₹3,000/- to the 
son.  
 
4. 
Both parties challenged the Family Court’s order 
through separate appeals before the High Court. 
Consequently, vide order dated 21.11.2005, the High 
Court enhanced the maintenance amount to 
₹20,000/- (Rupees twenty thousand only) per month, 
allocating ₹15,000/- (Rupees fifteen thousand only) 
to the respondent and ₹5,000/- (Rupees five 
thousand only) to the son. Subsequently, the 
respondent filed an application under Sections 24 
and 26 of the HMA, seeking further enhancement of 
interim maintenance. In her application, she claimed 
an enhanced amount of ₹1,45,000/- (Rupees one 
lakh forty five thousand only) per month, contending 
that 
the 
appellant’s 
income 
had 
increased 
significantly, exceeding ₹4,00,000/- (Rupees four 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 4 of 29 
 
lakhs only) per month, inclusive of salary, perks, 
allowances, and bonuses. She further argued that 
the financial needs of both, her and the son, had 
increased manifold since the prior determination of 
maintenance.  
 
5. 
During the pendency of the application, the 
appellant, in July 2015, voluntarily increased the 
interim maintenance to ₹65,000/- (Rupees sixty five 
thousand only) per month. He agreed to pay 
₹50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) to the 
respondent, effective from the date of filing the 
enhancement 
application 
on 
28.02.2009, 
and 
₹15,000/- (Rupees fifteen thousand only) to the son, 
effective from July 2015. However, the appellant 
contended that following the dismissal of his divorce 
petition on 14.07.2016 upon being withdrawn by 
him, the Family Court had become functus officio, 
rendering it incapable of granting any further relief 
under Sections 24 and 26 of the HMA. He also 
submitted that the provisions of Section 26 of the 
HMA do not permit granting of maintenance to an 
adult male child.  
 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 5 of 29 
 
6. 
The respondent’s application for enhanced interim 
maintenance rested on her assertion of significant 
changes in circumstances since the last maintenance 
order, including the increased financial requirements 
of herself and the son. On the other hand, the 
appellant’s position focused on the legal implications 
of the withdrawal of his divorce petition and the 
applicability of Section 26 of the HMA concerning the 
maintenance of an adult male child.  
 
7. 
The Family Court, in its order dated 16.08.2018, 
allowed 
the 
respondent’s 
application 
for 
enhancement of maintenance and held that the relief 
in an application filed under Section 24 of the HMA 
can only be granted from the date of filing of the 
application, i.e., 28.02.2009, until the date the main 
divorce petition was dismissed as withdrawn, i.e., 
14.07.2016. Proceedings under Section 26 of the 
HMA 
are 
independent 
of 
the 
main 
divorce 
proceedings, and relief under this section can be 
granted for a period beyond the dismissal of the main 
divorce petition. The Court therein observed that the 
appellant had adopted delaying tactics, which 
prevented the timely resolution of the respondent’s 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 6 of 29 
 
enhancement application. The appellant had been 
evasive in disclosing his actual income and assets, 
concealing his true financial status, including his 
movable and immovable properties. Therefore, he 
failed to discharge his moral and legal obligations to 
provide reasonable and just maintenance to his wife 
and son, commensurate with their social and 
economic standing.  
 
8. 
The Family Court held that the respondent and her 
son 
are 
entitled 
to 
enhanced 
maintenance 
considering the increased expenditures for a growing 
child and the respondent’s requirements aligned with 
her social status. Accordingly, the Family Court 
directed the appellant to pay the following amounts: 
 
i. 
₹1,15,000/- 
(Rupees 
one 
lakh 
fifteen 
thousand only) per month as pendente lite 
maintenance to the wife and the son from 
28.02.2009 to 14.07.2016, when the divorce 
petition was withdrawn. 
ii. 
₹35,000/- (Rupees thirty five thousand only) 
per month to the son from 15.07.2016, until 
he attains the age of 26 years or becomes 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 7 of 29 
 
financially independent, whichever is earlier. 
This amount shall be subject to a 10% 
increase every two years starting 28.05.2019. 
iii. 
Litigation costs of ₹2,00,000/- (Rupees two 
lakhs only). 
 
9. 
Both the parties challenged the above order of the 
Family Court vide two separate appeals before the 
High Court. It is the judgment passed in these 
appeals by the High Court, which is challenged before 
us by the appellant. 
10. The High Court considered whether the Family Court 
loses its jurisdiction to decide pending applications 
under Sections 24 and 26 of the HMA, upon 
withdrawal of the main divorce petition. The 
appellant argued that the Family Court becomes 
functus officio upon such withdrawal, and therefore, 
proceedings for interim maintenance and child-
related relief under Sections 24 and 26 of the HMA, 
respectively, 
could 
not 
be 
adjudicated. 
This 
contention was based on the assumption that the 
statutory jurisdiction under Sections 24 and 26 of the 
HMA is ancillary to the divorce proceedings and 
cannot survive withdrawal of the main case. The High 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 8 of 29 
 
Court rejected this argument, holding that both 
provisions are independent in nature and continue to 
operate despite the withdrawal of the divorce petition. 
The High Court observed that the legislature's intent 
behind Section 24 of the HMA is to ensure that a 
financially dependent spouse is not left without 
resources during the pendency of matrimonial 
disputes, and this obligation cannot be unilaterally 
nullified by withdrawal of the petition. It emphasized 
that allowing withdrawal of the main petition to 
terminate Section 24 of the HMA proceedings would 
render the dependent spouse financially vulnerable 
and create a procedural loophole for evasion of legal 
obligations. The High Court concluded that interim 
maintenance proceedings have an independent 
existence and are not strictly ancillary to the main 
proceedings. It held that the Family Court's 
jurisdiction to adjudicate interim maintenance under 
Section 24 of the HMA extends until the date of 
withdrawal of the main petition, thereby ensuring 
that the dependent spouse’s financial security is not 
abruptly disrupted by procedural tactics. 
 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 9 of 29 
 
11. With respect to Section 26 of the HMA, which 
pertains to custody, maintenance, and education of 
minor children, the High Court provided a detailed 
analysis of the statutory language and intention. It 
held that the provision explicitly permits Courts to 
make orders “from time to time,” granting or 
modifying reliefs related to children, irrespective of 
the pendency or withdrawal of the main matrimonial 
proceedings. The High Court reasoned that matters 
concerning the welfare of children are not merely 
incidental to the matrimonial dispute but are of 
paramount and enduring importance. Recognizing 
that the interests of the children are paramount, the 
High Court clarified that the Family Court retains 
jurisdiction under Section 26 of the HMA even after 
withdrawal of the main petition, ensuring that 
children’s needs are addressed in an ongoing and 
dynamic manner. 
 
12. The High Court also dismissed the appellant's appeal 
placing reliance on the this Court’s decision in Ajay 
Mohan and Ors. v. H.N, Rai and Ors.2, observing 
that the judgment was delivered in a different context 
 
2 (2008) 2 SCC 507 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 10 of 29 
 
and was not applicable to matrimonial proceedings 
under the HMA. It noted that this Court in Ajay 
Mohan (Supra), did not address the specific 
statutory framework or the unique considerations 
governing Sections 24 and 26 of the HMA. 
Reaffirming its position, the High Court underscored 
that the provisions under Sections 24 and 26 of the 
HMA serve distinct and independent purposes—one 
ensuring financial support for the dependent spouse 
and the other protecting the welfare of minor 
children. It concluded that the Family Court’s 
jurisdiction to adjudicate these matters persists 
independent of the status of the primary matrimonial 
dispute, thereby reinforcing the legislative objective 
of ensuring fairness and equity in matrimonial 
proceedings. 
 
13. The High Court, while deciding the correctness of 
interim maintenance provided by the Family Court, 
heavily relied on the judgment of this Court in 
Rajnesh v. Neha and Another3. This Court, in this 
judgment laid down the principles to ensure 
equitable determination of financial support for the 
 
3 (2021) 2 SCC 32 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 11 of 29 
 
wife and dependent child. It reiterated that 
maintenance should be determined after considering 
the status and lifestyle of the parties, reasonable 
needs of the wife and children, the wife’s educational 
qualifications, 
professional 
skills, 
and 
earning 
capacity, as well as the appellant’s financial standing 
and obligations. It must also address the rising cost 
of living and inflation to ensure a standard of living 
that is proportionate to the appellant’s financial 
capacity and consistent with the standard of living 
the wife and children were accustomed to prior to 
separation. This Court highlighted that a husband 
cannot evade his duty of disclosure by concealing 
assets, as financial transparency is critical to the fair 
adjudication of maintenance claims. 
 
14. In this case, the High Court observed that the 
appellant’s income, primarily from employment and 
investments, demonstrated his ability to provide for 
the wife and child’s maintenance adequately. The 
evidence revealed that the appellant earned over 
₹4,00,000 (Rupees four lakhs only) per month 
between 2007 and 2016. Although he claimed higher 
living expenses due to his residence in Mauritius, the 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 12 of 29 
 
High 
Court 
found 
his 
arguments 
to 
be 
unsubstantiated, as his financial resources allowed 
him to meet maintenance obligations without undue 
hardship. The High Court further noted several 
instances of the appellant’s deliberate attempts to 
mislead the judicial process. He withheld critical 
financial 
documents 
and 
selectively 
disclosed 
information to conceal the full extent of his wealth. 
The inquiry into the statutory forms of the appellant 
revealed that he had investments in mutual funds 
valued at ₹5.10 crores as early as 2009-2010, 
significant sums deposited in bank accounts, and 
other financial transactions that were not initially 
disclosed. 
 
15. The High Court also identified false representations 
by the appellant regarding his property and income. 
He denied ownership of a property located at F-146, 
Richmond Park, Gurgaon, despite evidence of its 
ownership and rental income accruing to him. 
Additionally, the 
appellant misrepresented his 
association with Prasham Consultants LLP, wherein 
he continued to receive financial benefits until his 
father replaced him in 2016. These findings 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 13 of 29 
 
demonstrated a pattern of deliberate suppression of 
material facts and assets by the appellant, aimed at 
minimizing his maintenance liability. Such conduct 
warranted judicial intervention to ensure justice and 
provide adequate financial support to the wife and 
child, reflecting principles of fairness, transparency, 
and equity. Consequently, the High Court directed 
the appellant to pay interim maintenance that 
adequately addressed the needs of the wife and child, 
proportionate to his financial capacity and consistent 
with the obligations of a responsible spouse and 
parent. 
 
16. Consequently, 
the 
High 
Court 
dismissed 
the 
appellant’s appeal challenging the order of interim 
maintenance granted by the Family Court, and, while 
allowing the respondent’s appeal, granted the 
following relief: 
i. 
MAT.APP. (F.C) 120/2019 filed by the wife is 
allowed to the extent that the interim 
maintenance granted to the wife under 
Section 24 of the HMA is enhanced from Rs. 
1,15,000/- 
(Rupees 
one 
lakh 
fifteen 
thousand only) to Rs. 1,45,000/- (Rupees on 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 14 of 29 
 
lakh forty five thousand only) per month from 
the date of filing of enhancement application 
i.e. 28.02.2009 till the date of withdrawal of 
divorce 
petition 
by 
the 
appellant 
i.e. 
14.07.2016. 
ii. 
All amounts paid by the appellant to the wife 
and the son till date shall be duly adjusted. 
iii. 
The appellant shall also be liable to pay 
interest at the rate of 12% per annum 
towards the shortfall in the maintenance 
amount for the concerned period. The 
interest shall be calculated on the amount of 
deficit from the time it became due in a 
particular month and till the time it is paid. 
iv. 
Based on the aforesaid, the arrears of 
maintenance to both the wife and the son, 
along with the interest, shall be paid within a 
period of eight (8) weeks from today. 
 
17. The appellant is before us challenging the above 
judgment of the High Court on the grounds that the 
respondent has played a fraud on the Courts by 
concealing material/relevant documents and by filing 
false affidavits in support of her enhancement 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 15 of 29 
 
application, and that the son could not be granted 
maintenance till the age of twenty-six years as per the 
law. The interest @ 12% per annum in punitive in 
nature even though he had never defaulted in 
payment of interim maintenance. 
 
18. We heard the parties in camera to discuss the 
possibility of an amicable solution but during the 
proceedings both the parties submitted that they are 
willing to have the marriage annulled by mutual 
consent as there remains no possibility of a reunion 
between them. 
 
19. During the interaction before this Court, we found 
both the parties to be fair and reasonable in their 
approach, demeanor and conduct. They have shown 
an honest intention to amicably settle their disputes 
instead of maligning each other and unnecessarily 
delaying the proceedings.   
 
20. Learned senior counsels for the respective parties 
have made their submissions at length. The parties 
have also filed their affidavits of assets as directed by 
this Court. 
 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 16 of 29 
 
21. Before we proceed further, it is relevant to note that 
the parties stayed together only for around five years 
of the marriage, and even though they have a son out 
of the wedlock, they have been staying separately for 
almost over two decades now. They have made 
multiple serious allegations against each other and 
have been conducting litigations. They have no 
intention of reconciling, their marriage exists only for 
namesake, and there has been no cohabitation 
between the parties since 2004. Though the petition 
for dissolution of marriage has been withdrawn by 
the appellant, the interim maintenance proceedings 
have been going on between the parties since 2004. 
 
22. The admitted long-standing separation, nature of 
differences, 
prolonged 
litigations 
pending 
adjudication, and the unwillingness of the parties to 
reconcile, are evidence enough to show that the 
marriage between the parties has completely broken 
down irretrievably. 
 
23. A Constitution Bench of this Court in its judgment in 
the case of Shilpa Sailesh v. Varun Sreenivasan4, 
 
4 (2022) 15 SCC 754 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 17 of 29 
 
laid down that it has the discretionary power to 
dissolve a marriage which in its opinion and on the 
evidence has broken down irretrievably. The Court is 
required to exercise this discretion cautiously while 
analyzing the facts and evidence of each case. In 
order to arrive at the decision regarding whether the 
marriage has irretrievably broken down, the Court 
needs to factually examine and firmly establish the 
same, after careful consideration. 
 
24. In Shilpa Sailesh (Supra), this Court further laid 
down the factors to be considered for such 
examination, and the same were reiterated in the 
case of Kiran Jyot Maini v. Anish Pramod Patel5. 
This Court in both these judgments opined that the 
factors to be examined include the period of 
cohabitation between the parties, the period of 
separation, the attempts made for reconciliation, 
nature and gravity of allegations made between the 
parties, and such other similar factors. 
 
25. This Court in plethora of judgments, such as Shilpa 
Sailesh (Supra) and Kiran Jyot Maini (Supra), 
 
5 (2024) SCC OnLine SC 1724 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 18 of 29 
 
Ashok Hurra v. Rupa Bipin Zaveri6 and Hitesh 
Bhatnagar v. Deepa Bhatnagar7, has laid down the 
clear position that a marriage can be dissolved by this 
Court on the ground of irretrievable breakdown when 
the relationship is so strained that the marriage has 
succumbed to the long standing differences between 
the parties and it has become impossible to save such 
a relationship. When the Court is convinced that 
there is no scope for the marriage to survive and no 
useful purpose, emotional or practical, would be 
served by continuing the soured relationship, and it 
finds that the marriage is completely dead, then it 
can exercise its inherent power under Article 142 of 
the Constitution of India to dissolve the marriage. 
 
26. In the present case, even though the parties 
cohabited for about five to six years after marriage, 
but they have been living separately for more than 
two decades now. From the material on record, it also 
appears that even during the period of cohabitation 
the relationship between the parties was strained. 
The parties have made multiple serious allegations 
 
6 (1997) 4 SCC 226 
7 (2011) 5 SCC 234 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 19 of 29 
 
against each other. The appellant has contended that 
the respondent was short-tempered, hostile and 
behaved inappropriately with him and his parents, 
which led him into depression. The respondent has 
alleged that the appellant’s family was indifferent 
towards her from the beginning, they had created an 
uncomfortable 
environment 
for 
her, 
and 
the 
appellant showed no concern or care towards her. 
She further alleged that in the five years of 
cohabitation, the appellant was hostile towards her, 
she was treated like a domestic help, was never taken 
care of, and she was never treated as a wife by him. 
She finally left her matrimonial house fearing threat 
to her life, after hearing conversations between the 
appellant and his mother. 
 
27. It is evident that the relationship between the parties 
appears to be strained from the beginning and only 
further soured over the years. Reconciliation 
proceedings during the pendency of the divorce 
petition also failed. The parties have been litigating 
maintenance proceedings for a prolonged period, and 
there appears to be no cogent reason to only deal with 
the issue of interim maintenance after twenty years 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 20 of 29 
 
of strained relationship and separation. These facts 
are admitted by the parties before us, and they have 
also mutually agreed for the dissolution of their 
marriage. Therefore, we believe that the marriage 
between the parties should be dissolved by this Court 
while exercising the discretionary power under 
Article 142 of the Constitution of India. 
 
28. Thus, considering the facts of this case, all the 
material on record, submissions of the parties and 
analyzing the same in light of the factors stated 
above, the marriage between the appellant and the 
respondent is ordered to be dissolved. 
 
29. The main issue between the parties all these years, 
since separation, is the quantum of maintenance to 
be paid by the appellant to the respondent. The issue 
of maintenance pendente lite is now infructuous with 
the dissolution of marriage, but the financial interest 
of the wife still needs to be protected through grant 
of permanent alimony. The learned senior counsels 
for the parties have made submissions at length 
regarding the financial condition of both the parties. 
In order to establish the correct financial position of 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 21 of 29 
 
both the parties, they have filed their respective 
affidavits of income and assets as ordered by this 
Court. 
 
30. Before going into the details of the financial position 
of the parties, it is imperative that we highlight the 
position of law with regard to determination of 
permanent alimony. This Court, in a catena of 
judgments, has laid down the factors that needs to 
be considered in order to arrive at a just, fair and 
reasonable amount of permanent alimony. 
 
31. There cannot be strict guidelines or a fixed formula 
for fixing the amount of permanent maintenance. The 
quantum of maintenance is subjective to each case 
and is dependent on various circumstances and 
factors. The Court needs to look into factors such as 
income of both the parties; conduct during the 
subsistence of marriage; their individual social and 
financial status; personal expenses of each of the 
parties; their individual capacities and duties to 
maintain their dependents; the quality of life enjoyed 
by the wife during the subsistence of the marriage; 
and such other similar factors. This position was laid 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 22 of 29 
 
down by this Court in Vinny Paramvir Parmar v. 
Paramvir Parmar8, and Vishwanath Agrawal v. 
Sarla Vishwanath Agrawal9. 
32. This Court in the case of Rajnesh v. Neha (Supra), 
provided a comprehensive criterion and a list of 
factors to be looked into while deciding the question 
of permanent alimony. This judgment lays down an 
elaborate and comprehensive framework necessary 
for deciding the amount of maintenance in all 
matrimonial proceedings, with specific emphasis on 
permanent alimony. The same has been reiterated by 
this Court in Kiran Jyot Maini v. Anish Pramod 
Patel (Supra). The primary objective of granting 
permanent alimony is to ensure that the dependent 
spouse is not left without any support and means 
after the dissolution of the marriage. It aims at 
protecting the interests of the dependent spouse and 
does not provide for penalizing the other spouse in 
the process. The Court in these two judgments laid 
down the following factors to be looked into: 
i. 
Status of the parties, social and financial. 
 
8 (2011) 13 SCC 112 
9 (2012) 7 SCC 288 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 23 of 29 
 
ii. 
Reasonable needs of the wife and the 
dependent children. 
iii. 
Parties’ 
individual 
qualifications 
and 
employment statuses. 
iv. 
Independent income or assets owned by the 
applicant. 
v. 
Standard of life enjoyed by the wife in the 
matrimonial home. 
vi. 
Any employment sacrifices made for the 
family responsibilities. 
vii. 
Reasonable litigation costs for a non-working 
wife. 
viii. Financial capacity of the husband, his 
income, 
maintenance 
obligations, 
and 
liabilities. 
These are only guidelines and not a straitjacket 
rubric. These among such other similar factors 
become relevant. 
 
33. This Court in Kiran Jyot Maini (Supra), while 
discussing the husband’s obligation to maintain the 
wife and the importance of his financial capacity in 
deciding the quantum, observed that: 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 24 of 29 
 
“26. Furthermore, 
the 
financial 
capacity of the husband is a critical 
factor in determining permanent 
alimony. The Court shall examine the 
husband's actual income, reasonable 
expenses for his own maintenance, 
and any dependents he is legally 
obligated to support. His liabilities 
and financial commitments are also 
to be considered to ensure a balanced 
and fair maintenance award. The 
court must consider the husband's 
standard of living and the impact of 
inflation and high living costs. Even if 
the husband claims to have no source 
of income, his ability to earn, given 
his education and qualifications, is to 
be taken into account. The courts 
shall ensure that the relief granted is 
fair, reasonable, and consistent with 
the standard of living to which the 
aggrieved party was accustomed. The 
court's 
approach 
should 
be 
to 
balance all relevant factors to avoid 
maintenance amounts that are either 
excessively high or unduly low, 
ensuring that the dependent spouse 
can live with reasonable comfort post-
separation.” 
 
34. In the present case, it is a matter of record and an 
admitted fact that the respondent is unemployed 
while the appellant is a well accomplished banker 
who has worked in multiple senior roles at various 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 25 of 29 
 
banks over the years. We have perused the records of 
finances produced before us. Even though the 
records of the DEMAT accounts and the employment 
letters produced by the appellant are almost ten 
years ago or earlier, his financial position can be 
suitably ascertained from them.  
 
35. It is admitted on record that the respondent is a home 
maker and has not been working in all these years, 
the son lives with her, who has now completed his B. 
Tech. course, and they reside in a house owned by 
the respondent’s mother. The appellant has paid for 
the son’s education as well as paid the interim 
maintenance as ordered by the Family Court. The son 
is now major and has also completed his graduation. 
 
36. The appellant is currently working as the Chief 
Executive Officer of Vision Bank in Dubai and his 
estimated salary is about AED 50,000 per month 
which means that he is earning around Rs. 10 to 12 
Lakhs per month. Though he has filed details of his 
DEMAT accounts from 2010, it is revealed that he 
had investments of around Rs.5 crores at that time. 
Further, he has three properties worth approximately 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 26 of 29 
 
Rs.2 
crores, 
Rs.5 
crores 
and 
Rs.10 
crores, 
respectively. 
 
37. During the period of cohabitation, the parties were 
initially residing in Mumbai when the appellant was 
working as a Foreign Exchange Executive with Global 
Trust Bank and subsequently in Chennai when the 
appellant changed his job. The appellant has worked 
at multiple positions in prestigious Banks and stayed 
in metropolitan cities with the respondent during the 
subsistence of the marriage. 
 
38. In compliance of this Court’s order dated 23.09.2024, 
the appellant has also paid Rs. 72 Lakhs as arrears 
of maintenance in addition to the maintenance 
already paid by him. 
 
39. It is not disputed that the appellant has the legal 
obligation as well as the financial capacity to 
maintain the respondent after dissolution of the 
marriage. As held by us in Kiran Jyot Maine 
(Supra), it is also necessary to ensure that the 
amount of permanent alimony should not penalize 
the husband but should be made with the aim of 
ensuring a decent standard of living for the wife. 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024

40. Considering the material on record, the totality of the 
circumstances and the facts of this case, a one-time 
settlement amount with provision for the respondent 
as well as the son, would be a fair arrangement. For 
the respondent, considering the standard of living 
enjoyed by her during subsistence of the marriage, 
the prolonged period of separation, and the 
appellant’s financial capacity, a one-time settlement 
amount of Rs. 5 crores (Rupees five crores only), 
appears to be just, fair and reasonable amount for 
the respondent to be paid by the appellant towards 
settlement of all pending claims also. 
 
41. It is also equitable and only obligatory for a father to 
provide for his children, especially when they have 
the means and the capacity to do the same. Even 
though the son is now major and has just finished 
his engineering degree, the High Court has rightly 
observed that it is only after completion of a college/ 
university degree and in some cases, completing a 
post-graduation/ professional degree, would the 
child be able to secure employment. In fact, it can 
safely be concluded that, in today's competitive 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024 
 
Page 28 of 29 
 
world, gainful employment may be feasible only after 
the child has pursued education beyond 18 years of 
age. Mere completion of his engineering degree does 
not guarantee a gainful employment, in these 
competitive times. The appellant herein has sufficient 
means to support his child, and thus provision 
should also be made for his maintenance and 
financial security as well. An amount of Rs. 1 crore 
(Rupees one crore only) towards the maintenance and 
care of the son appears to be fair, which he can utilize 
for his higher education and as security till he 
becomes financially independent. 
 
42. Therefore, we fix the abovementioned amount as  
one-time settlement amount to be paid by the 
appellant to the respondent and his son within a 
period of four months from the date of this judgment. 
 
43. Consequently, the appeals are disposed of with the 
above observations and directions to the parties. 
Accordingly, decree of divorce be granted in exercise 
of this Court’s power under Article 142 of the 
Constitution of India. Further, the appellant shall 
pay the amount provided above towards permanent 

SLP(Civil)Nos.21710-21711/2024

alimony to the respondent and his son within the 
time stipulated above. The Registry to draw a decree 
accordingly.
