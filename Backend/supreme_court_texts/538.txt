Abatement is set aside and applications for substitution
are allowed. Application(s) for intervention is allowed. 
3.
By this common judgment a batch of civil appeals arising
out of the common order passed by the High Court of Judicature
at Allahabad in different writ applications and special appeals is
disposed of.  
4.
Civil Appeal No. 894 of 2020 preferred by UP Roadways
Retired Officials and Officers Association is taken as the lead
case. 
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 894 OF 2020
5.
In this civil appeal challenge is to the common order dated
24.11.2016 passed by the High Court in Special Appeal No. 685
of 2014 and other connected matters which in turn arose out of
common order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High
Court on  07.07.2014  in  Writ  Application  No.  63469  of  2012
(Suresh Chandra vs. State of U.P. through Secretary & Ors.)
and 51 connected writ applications. The learned Single Judge as
well as the Division Bench, under the impugned judgment have
dismissed the special appeals and writ applications holding that

3
the appellants/petitioners do not hold the pensionable post and,
thus, are not entitled for receiving pension. 
6.
The  issue  falling  for  consideration  is  whether  the
appellants  who  are  the  former  employees  of  Uttar  Pradesh
Roadways, a temporary department of the State Government,
are  holding  any  pensionable  post  before  or  after  their
absorption in the U.P. State Roadways Transport Corporation1.
Government  orders  regarding  service  under  U.P.
Roadways and thereafter U.P. State Roadways Transport
Corporation
7.
In 1947, Uttar Pradesh Roadways2  was created as a
temporary department of the State Government for providing
public  transport  facilities.  Since  the  department  itself  was
temporary, the employees working therein were also appointed
temporarily and were not members of regular ser
vice. 
7.1
On  16.09.1960,  a  Government  Order3 was  issued
providing service conditions of the Roadways employees which
1 ‘Corporation’
2 ‘the Roadways’
3 ‘GO’

4
were different than the service conditions of employees working
in different Government departments. 
7.2.
On 28.10.1960, another GO was issued providing for
pension  to  the  permanent  employees of  the  erstwhile
Roadways. It was mentioned in this order that remaining non-
gazetted employees of the Roadways (who are not permanent)
would be entitled for benefits under the Employees Provident
Fund Scheme. 
7.3.
On 01.06.1972, the Corporation was created under
Section 3 of the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950.4 
7.4.
On  05.07.1972,  a  GO  was  issued  treating  all  the
employees of the Roadways on deputation with the Corporation
without specifying the period of deputation and also assuring
them that their service conditions in the Corporation will not be
inferior as compared to their service conditions prior to their
absorption in the Corporation. 
7.5.
On  20.04.1997,  Article  350  of  U.P.  Civil  Service
Regulations5 was amended with retrospective effect. However,
no  amendment  was  made  in  Note  3  of  Article  350  which
provides  that  non-gazetted  post  in  Government  Technical
Industrial Institution is not qualified for pension. 
4 ‘Act, 1950’
5 ‘Regulations’

5
7.6.
On  19.06.1981,  the  Corporation  framed  service
regulations in exercise of power under Section 45 (2) (c) of the
Act, 1950. 
7.7.
On 28.04.1982, the Roadways (Abolition of Post and
Absorption of Employees) Rules, 1982 were framed providing
for absorption of all employees of the Roadways in the service
of the Corporation w.e.f. 28.07.1982. 
Appellants’ Case
8.
There are three sets of appellants segregated on the
basis of the date of appointment:
(1)
Those who were appointed in the Roadways prior to
the G.O. dated 16.09.1960 and have retired. 
(2)
Those who were appointed after 16.09.1960 but prior
to creation of the Corporation as on 01.06.1972 and have
retired.
(3)
Those  who  were  appointed  after  01.06.1972  when
the Corporation was created and have retired. 
9.
Admittedly, the appellants employees have already
received  their  entire  post-retiral  benefits  immediately  after
their retirement decades ago without any protest or claim that
they hold a pensionable post. The appellants started claiming

6
pension after the Division Bench judgment of the High Court in
U.P.S.R.T.C. vs. Mirza Athar Beg6  upholding the judgment
of the learned Single Judge dated 25.08.2010 passed in W.P.
No. 7728 (S/S) of 1996. The appellants’ claim is also based on
other two judgments of the Allahabad High Court in the matter
of The Managing Director, U.P.S.R.T.C vs. S.M. Fazil & 03
others7 (W.P. No. 5440 of 2000 (S/B) and in the matter of
U.P.S.R.T.C  &  Ors.  Vs.  Shri  Narain  Pandey8 in  Special
Appeal No. 40 of 2007. A Special Leave Petition (SLP (c) No.
7709/2011) against the judgment in the matter of Mirza Athar
Beg was dismissed by a non-speaking order dated 10.07.2013. 
10.
The appellants submitted representation basing their
claim in the line of  Mirza Athar Beg (supra). However, the
representation was rejected subsequent to which the subject
writ petition was filed. 
Appellants’ submissions
11.
Learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants
would submit that the appellants are entitled for pension in
6 2011 (2) ALJ 327
7 W.P. No. 5440 of 2000 (S/B)
8 2009:AHC-LKO:3978-DB

7
terms of the Government Order dated 16.09.1960 as they were
appointed prior to establishment of the Corporation in the year
1972. According to them, once the appellants have been made
permanent in the Corporation vide Government Orders dated
16.09.1960  and  28.10.1960  they  should  be  treated  to  be
holding a pensionable post. It was also their case that Article
350  of  U.P.  Civil  Service  Regulations  was  amended  by  a
Notification  dated  20.04.1977  whereby  the  word  ‘Post’  was
replaced by the word ‘Establishment’ and as such employees of
all establishments under the State Government are deemed to
be working on a pensionable post unless the establishment is
excluded. Therefore, on a conjoint reading of Government Oder
dated 28.10.1960 with the amendment made in the year 1977
in Article 350, the appellants are entitled to pension.
12.
The appellants  also  relied  on  the  judgment  in  the
matter  of  Mirza  Athar  Beg (supra),  S.M.  Fazil (supra)  &
Narain  Pandey (supra).  The  main  focus  of  the  appellants’
claim  is  on  the  amendment  to  the  Article  350  of  the
Regulations,  after  which,  according  to  the  appellants,
Government  has  not  issued  any  order  excluding  the
establishment  in  which  the  appellants  were  employed  and

8
holding  a  pensionable  post.  It  is  also  argued  that  after  the
establishment of the Corporation under Section 3 of the Act,
1950,  no  rule or  regulation  has  been  framed  in  exercise of
power  under  Section  44  denying  pension  to  the  appellants.
Therefore,  the  general  provisions  under  Article  350  of  the
Regulations would be applicable and the appellants are entitled
for pension. 
13.
Apropos the objection that the writ petition was filed
belatedly,  after  decades  from  the  date  of  retirement,  it  is
submitted that the appellants have recurring cause of action
and delay in filing the writ petition is not fatal.  
14.
Per contra, Ms Garima Prasad, learned senior counsel
appearing for the Corporation vehemently argued that all the
appellants have already opted for and availed the post-retiral
benefits  under  the  Employees  Provident  Fund  Scheme,
therefore,  their  present  claim  preferred  after  huge  delay
ranging between 8 to 32 years has rightly been dismissed by
the High Court. Reference is made to  Union of India & Ors.
Vs. M.K. Sarkar9 
9 (2010) 2 SCC 59

9
15.
Ms. Prasad would distinguish the fact situation in the
matters of  Mirza  Athar  Beg (supra),  S.M.  Fazil (supra)  &
Narain Pandey (supra) by pointing out that in these cases the
High Court has not considered the effect of Note 3 of Article
350 of the Regulations which has neither been amended nor
deleted even by the amendment dated 20.04.1977. It is further
submitted  that  the  Roadways  was  an  establishment  having
workshops  both  major  and  smaller,  thus,  included  in  the
category  of  technical  institution  as  has  been  held  by  the
Allahabad High Court in the judgment rendered in Bachai Lal
v. U. P. S. R. T. C., Allahabad and others.10  The Roadways
is  also  an  industry  according  to  the  test  prescribed  in  the
matter of General Manager, Telecom vs. A. Srinivasa Rao
& Ors.11. Therefore, the non-gazetted post in the Roadways did
not qualify for pension in view of Note 3 of Article 350 of the
Regulations. It is then argued that the service conditions of
employees of the Roadways as existing prior to their absorption
in  the  Corporation  were  never  protected  by  GO  dated
05.07.1972  under  which  the  appellants  are  not  entitled  for
pension as they have never worked on any pensionable post as
indicated in para 1 of GO dated 28.10.1960 till their absorption
10 (1991) 2 UPLBEC1095
11 (1997) 8 SCC 767

10
in the Corporation w.e.f 28.04.1982. Further distinguishing the
above  three  cases  on  which  the  appellants  have  placed
reliance, it is argued that the appellants in the three above
cited cases were working on pensionable post even as per GO
dated  28.10.1960  whereas  none  of  the  appellants  in  the
present batch of appeals have worked on any pensionable post
as per the said GO, therefore, the appellants derive no benefit
out of the above three cited cases. 
16.
In respect of the employees appointed after creation
of  the  Corporation  w.e.f.  01.06.1972  it  is  argued  that  such
appellants are not entitled to the benefit of pension on the
basis  of  GO  dated  05.07.1972  or  the  provisions  of  the
Regulations relating to employees of the erstwhile Roadways
sent on deputation to the Corporation and thereafter absorbed
therein. 
17.
In  respect  of  the  appellants  who  were  appointed
subsequent to 01.06.1972 i.e. after creation of the Corporation,
the  State  Government  subsequently  issued  GO  dated
20.10.2004 according approval for payment of pension to those
employees who had been appointed on pensionable post in the

11
Corporation  till  18.06.1981.  Therefore,  such  appellants  who
were never appointed/worked on pensionable post as per GO
dated 28.10.1960 till 18.06.1981, are not entitled to pension. 
18.
Learned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the
writ petition on the ground of delay and laches; waiver and
acquiescence but at the same time proceeded to decide the
petitions  on  merits  and  after  threadbare  discussion  of  the
applicable GOs and Regulations rejected the claim on merits.
Learned  Single  Judge  distinguished  the  case  of  the  present
batch  of the  appellants  from that  of  the  Mirza  Athar  Beg
(supra), S.M. Fazil (supra) & Narain Pandey (supra).
19.
On appeal before the Division Bench, the claim of the
appellants was once again dismissed and the order passed by
the learned Single Judge has been upheld on all material issues
including the appellants’ claim on the basis of parity vis-à-vis
the earlier cases in the matter of  Mirza Athar Beg (supra),
S.M. Fazil (supra) & Narain Pandey (supra)
ANALYSIS

12
20.
The  Roadways  was  created  as  a  temporary
department  in  1947.  A  Government  Order  was  issued  on
16.09.1960  providing  service  conditions  of  the  Roadways
employees.  The  said  GO  is  reproduced  hereunder  for  ready
reference: 
“G.O. No. 3014 D/XXX- 135/59 dated Sept. 16, 1960 
Subject:  Terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  temporary
employees in the U.P. Roadways - Revisions of. 
I am  directed  to say that the  question of revising the
terms and conditions of service of the Roadways employee,
which is a nationalized commercial undertaking and has to
work in conditions different from those prevailing in regular
government  offices,  has  been under  the  consideration  of
Government for some time past.
The  passenger  and  goods  services  have  to  run
irrespective of the fact whether it is a Sunday or a festival.
The  schedule  of  passenger  services  run  by  the  State
Undertaking cannot be altered off an on. In order to keep
the Roadways services going the maintenance and repairs of
vehicles  has  to  be  attend  to  even  at  odd  hours  at  the
workshops.  At  present  the  conditions  of  service  of  the
employees  of  the  U.P.  Government  Roadways  and  the
Central Workshop, Kanpur are governed by the various rules
and  standing  orders  of  Government  applicable  to  other
temporary  government  servants  under  the  rule  making
powers  of  the  Governor.  In  view  of  the  special  service
conditions  of  employees  of  the  Roadways  it  seems
necessary to evolve a new set of service conditions for its
employees which may be compatible with the nature of work
and  functions  of  the  organization.  Accordingly,  in  super
session of all previous orders on the subject, the Governor
has been pleased to pass the following orders prescribed
revised  terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  temporary
employees of the U.P. Roadways including those detailed in
para 2 below. The revised terms and conditions of service
shall be applicable to all future entrants in the Roadways
organization and shall be enforced in the manner mentioned
hereinafter  in  the  case  of  temporary  employee  including
those  on the  work  charge  strength and paid on monthly
basis.

13
 (1) All temporary employees except those referred to in
para 2 shall get one day's rest in every period of seven days
in accordance with the rules to be framed by Government. In
case the employees is deprived of any of the days or rest,
he  shall  be  allowed  within  the  same  or  following  month
compensation holidays of equal number of the days of rest
so lost. 
(2) They shall be entitled to get one days paid holidays for
every  20  days  of  work  performed  by  them  during  the
previous  calender year, subject to the  condition  that the
employee  has  worked  for  a  period  of  240  days  or  more
during the previous calender year. In case the employees is
not able to avail of full or part of the leave admissible to him
during  the  calender  year,  it  will  be  carried  over  to  the
following year, subject to a maximum of 30 days. 
(3) They shall got five days festival holidays in a calender
year as prescribed by Government and subject to the rules
to be framed for the purpose.
 (4) They shall be paid extra wages at the rate of twice of
ordinary rate of wages in respect of work performed by them
beyond the prescribed hours of work.
 (5) Their services are liable to termination on one month's
notice on either side, or one month's pay in lieu thereof. 
(6) In other respect the conditions of service will remain the
same as at present. 
The revised terms and conditions of services mentioned in
para 1 above shall not apply to the following category of
employees:- 
(a) All employees working in the offices establishment of the
Asstt. General Manager, General Manager, Service Manager,
Chief  Mechanical  Engineer,  Roadways  Central  Workshop,
Kanpur  and  the  Head  Quarter  Office  of  the  Transport
Commissioner. 
(b) Supervisory staff of the rank of Junior Station Incharge
and above on the traffic side; 
(c) Technical staff of the rank of Junior Foreman and above
on the engineer side; 
The  above  three  categories  of  Roadways  staff  will
continue to be treated as regular government servants and

14
will  be  entitled  to  the  benefits  admissible  to  any  other
government servant of the same category. 
3. The Roadways and Central Workshop employees to whom
the revised service rules are being made applicable shall be
entitled  to  the  provident  fund  benefits  according  to  the
provisions  of the  Employees Provident  Fund Act. For this
necessary  orders  have  already been issued separately in
G.O.  No.  1488-D/XXX  2198/59  dated  July,  29,  1960.
Immediate step may please be taken for the implementation
of  the  orders  issued  in  the  above  G.O.  The  employees
governed by the new terms and conditions of service will
continue  to  get  facilities  for  medical  treatment  so  far
enjoyed by them. All future entrants shall also be entitled to
facilities for medical treatment admissible to Government
servants. The canteen and rest house facilities as may be
prescribed by government shall also be made available to
them in course of time. 
4. These order shall come into force w.e.f. October 1, 1960
and shall apply to all future entrants in the service of the
Roadways  organization  and  also  the  existing  temporary
employees who accept to continue to work on the revised
terms and conditions  of service. The  status of  Roadways
employees already made permanent remains unaffected. All
the existing temporary employees except those mentioned
in para 2 above may be asked to indicate in writing if the
new service conditions mentioned above are acceptable to
them. Those who accept the new terms and conditions of
service will be required to fill in a separate acceptance for
which will be kept with their service records. If, however,
any of the employees do not accept the new terms their
services are to be terminated in accordance with the terms
of their employment. I am to suggest that the implications of
the revised orders may be explained to all concerned by the
General  Managers  and  Asstt.  General  Mangers  and  Chief
Mechanical Engineer and that necessary action may please
be  intimated  forthwith  in  order  to  implement  the  above
orders." (Emphasis supplied) “
21.
Thereafter  another  GO  was  issued  on  28.10.1960
providing  for  pension  to  the  permanent  employees  of  the
Roadways. This GO was issued under Note 3 of Article 350 of

15
the  Regulations.  We  shall  first  reproduce  Article  350  of  the
Regulations and thereafter GO dated 28.10.1960:
"350. All establishments whether temporary or permanent,
shall be deemed to be pensionable establishments; 
Provided that it is open to the State Government to rule
that the service in any establishment does not qualify for
pension. 
1.  Service  in  Dak  Bungalow  and  District  Garden
Establishments does not qualify. 
2. The service of a Patwari, whether appointed before or
after the abolition of the Patwari or Village Officers' Cases
and Funds, does not qualify in any case in which it did not
qualify prior to that abolition. 
3. Service in non-gazetted posts in Government Technical
and Industrial institutions  in the Uttar Pradesh does not
qualify in the case of persons appointed to such posts on or
after November 15,1938." 
Exceptions-- This rule does not apply to the posts declared
pensionable in Shram (Kha) Vibhag G.O.No.810 (E) XXXVI-
B-- 106/56, dated May 29, 1963 and Udyog (Gha) Vibhag
G.O.No.375-ED/XVII-D-AQ-19-ED,60, dated JUNE 5, 1963.”
“GO No. 3567-P/XXX-2198/99 dated 28.10.1960 - In
continuation  of  G.O.  No.  30140/XXX-135-V/1959  dated
16.9.1960,  I  am  directed  to  say  that  the  question  or
declaration  the  permanent  posts  in  the  Roadways
Organization  (including  the  Roadways  Central  Workshop
Kanpur) as pensionable has been under consideration of
Government for some time past. In this connection, the
Governor has been pleased to order that the permanent
gazetted  and  non-gazetted  incumbents  of  the  following
three categories would be entitled to the contributory 10
Provident Fund cum Pension Rules:- 
(a) The employees working in the office establishment of
the  Asstt.  General  Manager,  General  Managers,  Service
Managers,  Chief  Mechanical  Engineer,  Roadways  Central
workshop,  Kanpur  and  the  Headquarter  office  of  the
Transport Commissioner. 

16
(b) Supervisory staff of the rank of Junior Station Incharge
and above on the traffic side. 
(c) Technical staff of the rank of Junior Foreman and above
on the Engineering side. 
2. The Governor has been further pleased to order, under
note 3 Below Article 350 of the Civil Service Regulations
that the rest of the permanent non-gazetted Employees
both  in  the  traffic  and  engineering  sections  of  the
organization, would be treated as non-pensionable posts
referred  to  above,  will  be  eligible  for  Provident  Fund
benefits  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the
Employees Provident Fund Act. 
3. I am also to add that Temporary Employment of the
categories mentioned in para 1 above will be entitled to
Provident fund benefits as provided under the Employees
Provident Funds Act. As and when they became permanent,
they will have the option to elect the contributory Provident
Fund cum Pension Benefits in lieu of Employees Provident
Fund. 
4. As regards the grant of Provident Fund Benefits to other
temporary and work charges employees of the Roadways
organization necessary orders have already been conveyed
to you in G.O. No. 14880/XXX-219/59 dated 29.7.1960.

Copy  forwarded  under  U.P.  Parivahan  Ayukta  (Lekha)

Managers,  Service  Managers,  Accounts  Officers  and  all
other concerned for information and necessary action." 
(Emphasis supplied)
22.
A  bare reading  of Article 350 would  manifest  that
service  in  non-gazetted  posts  in  Government  Technical  and
Industrial Institutions in the State of Uttar Pradesh does not
qualify for pension and it will be covered under Contributory
Provident Fund Scheme. 

17
23.
The State Government felt it necessary to evolve a
new set of service conditions considering the nature of duties
and functions of the Roadways. In the above quoted GO dated
28.10.1960,  the  State  Government  considered  and  declared
some  permanent  gazetted  and  non-gazetted  posts  of  the
Roadways to be entitled for pension. Clauses (2) & (3) of GO
dated 28.10.1960 clearly provided that only those covered in
clause (1) of the GO would be entitled to pension whereas the
rest  of  the  permanent  non-gazetted  employees  both  in  the
traffic  and  engineering  sections  of  the  Roadways  would  be
treated  as  non-pensionable  posts  and  will  be  eligible  for
provident fund benefits in accordance with the provisions of the
Employees Provident Fund Act.  This provision made a specific
reference to Note 3 of Article 350 of the Regulations. 
24.
It was also provided that temporary employment of
the categories mentioned in para 1 will be entitled to provident
fund. However, as and when they became permanent, they will
have the option to elect the contributory provident fund cum
pension benefits in lieu of employees’ provident fund. In yet
another circular dated 21.04.1961, it was again clarified that

18
the  posts  mentioned  in  clause  (1)  of  GO  dated  28.10.1960
should  be  treated  as  pensionable  and  those  temporary
employees falling in the said clause shall also be treated as
pensionable from the date they were converted into permanent
post. 
25.
The Corporation was constituted under Section 3 of
the Act, 1950 w.e.f. 01.06.1972. By GO dated 07.06.1972 all
the employees of the erstwhile Roadways holding permanent
posts as per GO dated 28.10.1960 were declared entitled for
pension except the following: 
(i)
Those working on daily wages; 
(ii)  Those appointed on ad-hoc basis; 
(iii)   Those  who  had  not  completed  minimum  service
period prescribed for the post; 
(iv)
 Those  holding  posts  which  were  not  declared
pensionable; 
(v)
Those  who  had  been  removed  from  service  after
departmental inquiry and those had been found guilty of
criminal charges. 
Subsequent to GO dated 05.07.1972, officers/employees
of the Roadways and the officers and staff of the Roadways

19
working in the Office of the Transport Commissioner, whether
permanent or temporary were considered to be on deputation
under the existing terms and conditions of their services. The
permanent  staff  of  the  Roadways  were  considered  on
deputation up till the date of their absorption permanently in
the  Corporation.  It  was  also  mentioned  in  the  GO  dated
05.07.1972  that  the  Government  assures  the  Roadways
employees that whenever service conditions of the employees
of  the  Corporation  shall  be  framed,  the  same  shall  not  be
inferior to the service conditions applicable to them under the
Roadways at the time of absorption. The GO dated 05.07.1972
is reproduced hereunder:

Transport Organisation.
Sir,

20
     After merger of the officers/employees working under
Uttar  Pradesh  Roadways  with  State  Road  Transport
Corporation, in connection with merger of services under
the  Corporation,  I  have  been  directed  to  issue  the
following, amending the Government order no. 3000/30-2-1
70/72 dated June 7, 1972:
(1)   According to the provision of para (1) (A) of the above
Government  order,  all  those  permanent  or  temporary
officers/employees  who  before  the  constitution  of  State
Road Transport Corporation were in the services of State
Roadways,  their  services  would  be  considered  in  the
Corporation on deputation.  For this deputation no period is
being fixed now.
(2) The State Road Transport Corporation has under section
45 of the Transport Corporation Act have not made rules
about the service conditions till now in connection with the
officers  and  employees  under  it.  Therefore,  leaving  the
above  discussed  Annexure  1  (1)  A  of  the  above
Government  order  dated  June  7,  1972,  the  remaining
annexures would be considered dismissed.  But whenever
the  Corporation  would  make  rules  regarding  service
conditions, then in them this assurance of the Government
would  be  included  that  the  service  condition  of  the
officers/employees under the Corporation in any condition
would  not be contemptuous than those conditions which
were  available  to  them  under  the  Uttar  Pradesh  State
Roadways  and  their  government  service  period,  their
seniority under the corporation, promotion, fixation of pay,
right  concerning  leave  and  financial  benefits  would  be
considered in that way only as they would have remained
in their being in government service.

In exercise of power under Section 45 (2)(c) of the
Act, 1950, the State Government framed the Road Transport
Corporation  Employees  (other  than  officers)  Service
Regulations, 198112.  Regulations 4 and 39 of the Regulations,
1981 being relevant are reproduced hereunder: 
"4. Option by the employees of the erstwhile Government
Roadways  Department  and  other  employees.  -  (1)  An
employee  of  the  erstwhile  U.P.  Government  Roadways
Department  who  was  placed  on  deputation  with  the
Corporation and who has or  is deemed to have offered for
absorption in the Service of the Corporation in accordance
with  Rule  4  of  the  Uttar  Pradesh  State  Roadways
Organisation  (  Abolition  of  Posts  and  Absorptions  of
Employee) Rules, 1982 ( hereinafter referred to as the said,
Rules),  shall  with  effect  from  August  28,  1982,  sand  so
absorbed, and shall, accordingly cense to be an employee of
the State Government with effect from the said date. 
Provided  that the  terms  and conditions  of  service  of  the
employees so absorbed in the Service of the Corporation
shall, subject to the provisions of G.O. No. 3414/XXX-2-170-
N-72, dated July 5, 1972, and the said rules be governed by
these regulations. 
(i) Existing employees, who are not covered by sub-
regulation (1) or those who are not exempted under
Regulation  2,  shall  within  one  month  of  the
commencement  of  these  regulations,  inform  the
appointing authority or such authority as the General
Manager may in this behalf appoint whether or not
they want to be governed by these regulations. 
(ii) If they opt or fail to exercise their option for being
governed  by  these  regulations,  their  terms  and
12 ‘Regulations, 1981’

22
conditions  of  appointment,  so  far  as  they  are
inconsistent  with  these  regulations,  shall  stand
rescinded: 
Provided  that,  in  respect  of  workmen  where  any  of  the
provisions of these regulations is less favourable than the
provisions  of  the  U.P.  Industrial  Disputes  Act,  1947,  the
Payment  of  Wages  Act,  1936,  the  Minimum  Wages  Act,
1948, the Factories Act, 1948 or of any other Act applicable
to them, the provisions of such Act shall apply. 
(iii)   If such persons do not opt for being governed by
these regulations, their services may be terminated in
accordance with the terms of their appointment." 
"39. Pension  and  other  retirement  benefits-(1)(i)
Subject  to  the  provisions  of  clause  (ii)  of  this  sub-
regulation, an employee of the Corporation shall not
be entitled to pension, but he shall be entitled to the
retirement benefits mentioned in sub-regulation (2). 
(ii)  A  person,  who  was  the  employee  of  the  State
Government  in  the  erstwhile  U.P.  Government
Roadways  and  has  opted  for  the  service  of  the
Corporation,  shall  be  entitled  to  pension  and  other
retirement benefits in terms of the G.O. No.3414/302-
170-N-72, dated July 5, 1972. 
(iii) Such employees who have come in the service of
the  Corporation  on  pensionable  posts  on  1st  June,
1972 or after that and now those posts have been
declared  non-pensionable  under  this  Rule;  the
Corporation would contribute in the Provident Fund of
such  employees  as  desired  under  the  provisions  of
Employees Provident Fund Scheme, 1952.
(2)  Without  prejudice  to  the  provisions  of  sub-
regulation  (1)  an  employee  (including  an  employee
who was in the service of the State Government in the
erstwhile  U.P.  Government  Roadways  Department),
shall be entitled to the following retirement benefits:
 (i) Employees Provident Fund or the General Provident
Fund, as the case may be;
 (ii)  Gratuity  in  accordance  with  the  Payment  of
Gratuity Act, 1972  or the relevant Government Rules,
as may be applicable; 

23
(iii)  Amount  due  under  Group  Insurance  Scheme,
1976; 
(iv) One free family pass in a year for journey within
the State; 
(v) A free family pass for his return to his home from
the place of posting at the time of retirement in case
he does not accept railway fare; 
(vi)  Any  other  benefit  that  may  be  allowed  by  the
Corporation from time to time. "
27.
Regulations  4 and  39 of the Regulations,  1981 as
extracted above made it very clear that an employee of the
Corporation shall not be entitled to pension, but he shall be
entitled to the retiral benefits mentioned in sub-regulation (2) of
Regulation 39. Only those employees of the State Government
working in the Roadways who have opted for services of the
Corporation shall be entitled to pension and other retirement
benefits in terms of GO dated 05.07.1972. It is to be understood
that there were temporary and permanent employees working
in  the  Roadways  and  there  were  regular  State  Government
employees  who  were  also  working  in  the  Roadways.  Under
Regulation  39,  quoted  above,  it  is  clearly  demarcated  that
those State Government employees who have opted for service
of the Corporation will be entitled for pension, otherwise an
employee of the Corporation shall not be entitled to pension

24
and these employees will be entitled to retirement benefits as
mentioned  in  sub-Regulation  (2)  of  Regulation  39.  At  this
juncture,  it  would  be  relevant  to  mention  that  the  pension
entitlement  of the Roadways  employees  (who  are not  State
Government  employees)  are  controlled  by  GO  dated
28.10.1960 which has already been dealt with in the preceding
paragraphs. 
28.
By  another  GO  dated  19.08.1993  it  was  again
clarified  that  the  employees/officers  of  the  Roadways  who
before 28.07.1982 are working/promoted on pensionable post
of the previous department, shall be entitled to pension on the
terms set forth in this GO. Those employees who do not want to
avail pensionary benefits shall submit their written consent to
this effect in order to avoid dispute in future. Once again, GO
dated 03.02.1994 was issued to the effect that such employees
who  before  the  constitution  of  the  Corporation  and
promulgation of merger rules, had been on the pensionable
post  in  the  State  Government,  would  be  considered  on
deputation service and will be considered entitled for pension.  

25
29.
In order to examine the appellants’ claim for pension
it is necessary to dwell on the pre-requisites provided in the GO
dated  28.10.1960.  To  be  covered  in  the  GO  for  receiving
pension it is necessary for the appellants to plead and establish
firstly,  that  they  were  holding  permanent  posts  in  the
Roadways, and they fall in the three categories of employees
referred to in para (1) of the GO. It is not the case of the
appellants  that  they  were  made  permanent  by  any  express
order issued by the Roadways management, nor they claim to
be working in any of the three posts referred to in para (1) of
the GO. Since para (2) of the GO clearly provides that the rest
of the permanent non-gazetted employees both in the traffic
and engineering sections of the organization, would be treated
as non-pensionable and similarly, all temporary employees will
also  be  non-pensionable,  the  appellants  are  not  entitled  to
pension as per GO dated 28.10.1960. Secondly, the appellants
are not covered under Article 350 as amended on 20.04.1997
of the  Regulations to hold the pensionable posts inasmuch as
despite  amendment  in  the  first  part  of  Article  350  of  the
Regulations, Note 3 thereof has not suffered amendment which
provides  that  service  in  non-gazetted  posts  in  Government

26
Technical and Industrial Institutions in Uttar Pradesh does not
qualify in the case of persons appointed to such posts on or
after  15.11.1938.  Since  the  Roadways  is  considered  to  be
Technical and Industrial Institution, the appellants are covered
under  Note  3  of  Article  350,  and  they  are  not  entitled  for
pension.
 30.
The High Court, under the impugned judgment, has
observed that the appellants having received retiral benefits
including  the  benefit  under  the  Employees  Provident  Fund
Scheme, cannot be permitted to turn round and contend that
they should also be given pension. We have also considered
this aspect of the matter and we approve the observations of
the High Court on the principle that a party to the litigation
cannot be permitted to approbate and reprobate. See National
Council of Educational Research and Training vs.  Shyam
Babu Maheshwari & Ors.,13 Krishna Kumar vs. Union of
India14 and Union of India vs. Kailas15.
31.
Similarly,  in  the matter  of  V.K.  Ramamurthy vs.
Union of India & Anr.,16  this Court considered the claim for
13 (2011) 6 SCC 412
14 (1990) 4 SCC 207
15 (1998) 9 SCC 721
16 (1996) 10 SCC 73

27
pension of those who opted for pension after a long gap of
retirement and held in para 4 that the contributory provident
fund retirees form a different class from those who had opted
for pension scheme and as such they are not entitled to claim
as  of  right  to  switch  over  from  Provident  Fund  Scheme  to
Pension Scheme. Similar is the proposition in the matter of All
India Reserve Bank Retired Officers Association & Ors.
Vs. Union of India & Anr.17
32.
In somewhat similar situation concerning employees
of  Oil  Natural  Gas  Commission  which  was  earlier  run  as  a
department of the Government of India prior to the enactment of
Oil and Natural Gas Commission Act, 1959, this Court in  The
Committee for Protection of Rights of ONGC Employees
& Ors. Vs. Oil and Natural Gas Commission, through its
Chairman & Anr.,18 held thus in para 13: 
“13. This  indicates  that  the  scheme  of  Contributory
Provident Fund, by way of retiral benefit, envisaged by the
Provident Fund Act, is in the nature of a substitute for old
age  pension  because  it  was  felt  that  in  the  prevailing
conditions  in  India,  the  institution  of  a  pension  scheme
could not be visualised in the near future. It was not the
intention  of  Parliament  that  Provident  Fund  benefit
envisaged  by  the  said  Act  would  be  in  addition  to
pensionary benefits. Section 12 of the Provident Fund Act
seeks to protect the wages of an employee to whom the
scheme framed under the said Act applies as well as the
17 (1992) Supp (1) SCC 664
18 (1990) 2 SCC 472

28
total quantum of certain specified benefits to which he is
entitled under the terms of his employment. With that end
in view, Section 12 prohibits an employer from reducing,
whether directly or indirectly, the wages of an employee to
whom the Scheme applies or the total quantum of benefits
in the nature of old age pension, gratuity, provident fund or
life insurance to which the employee is entitled under the
terms  of  his  employment  express  or  implied.  The  said
section  proceeds  on  the  basis  that  if  an  employee  is
entitled to any benefit in the nature of old age pension
under the terms of his employment the said benefit would
not be denied to him on the application of the Scheme. It is
not the case of the petitioners that on June 30, 1961, when
the Provident Fund Scheme was made applicable to the
Commission, the petitioners had become permanent and
were entitled to pension. It cannot, therefore, be said that
on  the  date  of  the  application  of  the  Provident  Fund
Scheme to the Commission, the petitioners were entitled to
pension under the terms of their employment. They cannot,
therefore,  invoke  the  provisions  of  Section  12  of  the
Provident Fund Act.”
33.
In the matter of Prabhu Narain vs. State of U.P.19,
(2004) 13 SCC 662, this Court held that to receive pension the
employees  must  establish  that  they  are  entitled  to  pension
under a particular rule or scheme. The following has been held
in para 5: 
“5.  No doubt pension is not a bounty, it is a valuable right
given  to an employee,  but, in the  first place  it must be
shown  that  the  employee  is  entitled  to  pension  under  a
particular rule or the scheme, as the case may be.”
34.
In  yet  another  judgment  rendered  in  Rajasthan
Road Transport Corporation & Anr. Vs. Mohini Devi,20 it is
held thus in para nos. 7, 8 & 9: 
19 (2004) 13 SCC 662
20 (2013) 11 SCC 603

29
“7. The Division Bench has considered the Regulations but
failed to notice  that there  is apparent error in the order
passed  by  the  learned  Single  Judge.  Indisputably,  the
employees concerned retired from service in 1991 and 1992
and after retirement they were paid CPF including the share
of employer's contribution. Hence, as per Regulation 3 of the
Regulations, no right accrued to the appellants/employees to
claim  pensionary  benefits  without  first  depositing  the
amount and complying with the Regulations.
8. The  matter  was  examined  by  this  Court  in Pepsu
RTC v. Mangal  Singh [(2011)  11  SCC  702  :  (2011)  2  SCC
(L&S) 322] wherein it was held as under: (SCC p. 722, paras
51-52)
“51.  The  common  thread  which  runs  through  all  these
appeals canvassed before us is that the respondents have
failed  to  comply  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the
Regulations, which govern the Pension Scheme. We have
already considered the nature and effect of the Regulations,
which are made under a statute. These statutory regulations
require  to  be  interpreted  in  the  same  manner  which  is
adopted while interpreting any other statutory provisions.
The Corporation as well as the respondents are obliged and
bound  to  comply  with  its  mandatory  conditions  and
requirements. Any action or conduct deviating from these
conditions  shall  render  such  action  illegal  and  invalid.
Moreover, the respondents have availed the retiral benefits
arising out of CPF and gratuity without any protest.
52. The respondents in all these appeals, before us, have
made  a  claim  for  pensionary  benefits  under  the  Pension
Scheme for the first time only after their retirement with an
unreasonable delay of more than 8 years. It is not in dispute,
in some appeals, that the respondents never opted for the
Pension Scheme for their alleged want of knowledge for non-
service of individual notices. In other appeals, although the
respondents applied for the option of the Pension Scheme
but indisputably never fulfilled the quintessential conditions
envisaged by the Regulations which are statutory in nature.”
9. We are, therefore, of the opinion that, in the facts and
circumstances of the case and in view of the law laid down
by this Court in the judgment referred to hereinabove, the
impugned  orders  passed  by  the  learned  Single  Judge
[Madugiri v. Rajasthan SRTC, WP (C) No. 5425 of 1993 (Civil
Writ  5425/1993),  order  dated  5-1-2006  (Raj)]  and  the
Division  Bench  [Rajasthan  SRTC v. Madugiri,  Civil  Special
Appeal (Writ) No. 212 of 2006, decided on 11-10-2006 (Raj)]
of the High Court cannot be sustained in law.”

30
35.
The common thread in the above referred judgments
of this Court is that pension is a right and not a bounty. It is a
constitutional right for which an employee is entitled on his
superannuation. However, pension can be claimed only when it
is  permissible  under  the  relevant  rules  or  a  scheme.  If  an
employee is covered under the Provident Fund Scheme and is
not holding a pensionable post, he cannot claim pension, nor
the writ court can issue mandamus directing the employer to
provide pension to an employee who is not covered under the
rules. 
36.
The  appellant(s)  have  relied  upon  three  earlier
judgments of the Allahabad High Court in the matter of Mirza
Athar  Beg  (supra), S.M. Fazil  (supra) and  Shri  Narain
Pandey  (supra), therefore, it would be appropriate to discuss
about the status of the said employees. 
37.
Mirza Athar Beg was promoted on the post of Junior
Clerk  in  the  Roadways  w.e.f  07.09.1958  in  the  office  of
Assistant General Manager at Charbagh Depot, Lucknow and
his  promotion  was  regularised  on  16.04.1960.  The  Division
Bench of the High Court noted the fact that it is not the case of

31
the Corporation that the respondent Mirza Athar Beg was not a
permanent  employee  of  the  Roadways.  Thus,  he  was
admittedly a permanent employee and, therefore, he was found
to be falling in the category of pensionable post as per GO
dated 28.10.1960. 
38.
S.M. Fazil was appointed as Assistant Traffic Inspector
in the Roadways on 19.04.1949. He was promoted as Junior
Station  Incharge  on  05.11.1956  and  thereafter  selected  as
Traffic Superintendent by the U.P. Public Service Commission in
1961. He was thereafter promoted to the gazetted class post of
Assistant  Regional  Manager  in  1981.  His  claim  before  the
Tribunal  was  to  the  effect  that  pension,  gratuity  and
commutation was sanctioned taking into account the services
rendered  w.e.f 05.11.1956 till  28.02.1983 leaving  his  earlier
services from 19.04.1949 to 05.11.1996. Therefore, in view of
Articles 350 and 370 of the Regulations, his period of service in
temporary  capacity  or  on  temporary  post  was  countable
towards qualifying services for pension and gratuity and he was
never absorbed in the services of the Corporation. Thus, the
case of S.M.Fazil is entirely distinguishable on facts. 

32
39.
True  it  is  that  Shri  Narain  Pandey was  granted
pension by the High Court despite he having been appointed on
the post of Junior Station Incharge on 05.05.1978. However, this
judgment was rendered without any reference to GOs dated
16.09.1960 and 28.10.1960 as also Note 3 of Article 350 of the
Regulations  and  the  provisions  of  the  Service  Regulations,
1981.  This  judgment,  therefore,  cannot  be  relied  upon  as
binding  precedent  as  the  same  has  been  rendered  without
referring to the applicable GOs and Regulations. 
40.
In  view  of  the  above  discussion,  the  appellant’s
reliance  on  the  judgments  rendered  by  the  Allahabad  High
Court in the matter of Mirza Athar Beg (supra),   S.M. Fazil &
03  others  (supra) and  Shri  Narain  Pandey  (supra) are
misplaced  as  in  the  said  matters,  the  respective  appellants
were  found  to  be  holding  permanent  posts  which  were
pensionable whereas in the present case, the appellants were
neither holding permanent posts nor holding any pensionable
posts as per GO dated 28.10.1960. Therefore, judgments in the
matter  Mirza Athar Beg  (supra),  S.M. Fazil & 03 others
(supra) and Shri Narain Pandey (supra) rendered by the High
Court  are  distinguishable  on  facts.  The  judgment  in  Shri

33
Narain  Pandey  (supra) has not  considered the legal  effect
flowing from the GO dated 16.09.1960 and 28.10.1960 as also
Note 3 of Article 350 of the Regulations. Therefore, the said
judgment of the Allahabad High Court is of no assistance to the
appellants. 
41.
For all the forestated reasons, civil appeal is liable to
be and is hereby dismissed.

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 895 OF 2020
42.
This appeal has been preferred by UPSRTC assailing
the order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of
Allahabad (Lucknow Bench) in Special Appeal No. 780 (S/B) of
2013  (UPSRTC  &  Anr.  Vs.  Roadways  Karmchari  Sanyukta
Parishad,  Uttar  Pradesh  &  Anr.).  Before  the  Division  Bench,
UPSRTC  challenged  the  order  passed  by  the  learned  Single
Judge  allowing  the  writ  petition  preferred  by  Roadways
Karmchari  Sanyukta  Parishad,  Uttar  Pradesh,21 consequently,
21 ‘RKSP’

34
directing the UPSRTC to extend the pensionary benefits and
pay pension w.e.f 27.08.1982 onwards in the light of GO dated
05.07.1972 and in pursuance of order dated 22.05.1989 passed
by the Division Bench of the High Court in Writ Petition Nos.
3273 of 1982, 3380 of 1982, 3400 of 1982, 3489 of 1982 and
4119 of 1982. 
43.
The issue before the Division Bench was in relation to
extending  pensionary  and  other  benefits  in  respect  of  such
employees who have been promoted on pensionable posts after
1982. According to the Division Bench, in other words, the issue
is whether the cutoff date of 1982 fixed by the UPSRTC basing
upon  the  provisions  of  absorption  rules  and  the  regulations
framed thereunder are rational having nexus with the object of
denying the benefit of pension to the members of the RKSP. 
44.
The Division Bench has referred to two GOs dated
07.06.1972  and  05.07.1972.  In  the  first  GO,  the
Officers/employees of the Roadways and those working in the
Transport  Commissioner’s  office  and  Head  Office,  whether
permanent  or  temporary,  shall  be  considered  on  deputation
under  existing  terms  and  conditions  of  their  service.  After

35
period of six months, the Corporation shall take steps for their
formal appointment and prepare service rules and those who
are willing to be absorbed shall be absorbed in the Corporation
for  which  required  number  of  posts,  both  permanent  and
temporary, shall be created. It was also provided in Clause (4)
of the GO dated 07.06.1972 that on absorption their service
conditions shall not be inferior to those under the Government
immediately  before  the  absorption  and  their  tenure  of
government  service  shall  be  considered  for  their  seniority,
promotion,  pay  fixation,  entitlement  for  leave  and  for  the
benefits of retirement in the same way as would have been
under the Government service. 
45.
In the second GO dated 05.07.1992, the earlier GO
dated 07.06.1972 was amended. The GO dated 05.07.1972 as
is quoted in impugned judgment passed in Special Appeal No.
780 (S/B) of 2013 has already been quoted in the preceding
para 24. 
46.
The High Court referred to the above GOs as also the
provisions of U.P. State Road Transport Corporation Employees
(other than Officers) Service Regulations, 1981 to hold that in

36
view  of  the  clear  provisions  in  the  GOs  that  the  Roadways
employees  sent  on  deputation  shall  enjoy  the  same  service
conditions  and  whenever  rules  are  framed  their  service
conditions  shall  not  be  inferior  to  the  conditions  as  were
available  under  the  Government  immediately  before  their
absorption,  therefore,  in  view  of  Regulation  39  of  the
Regulations,  1981  notified  on  19.06.1981,  the  erstwhile
employees  of  the  Roadways  who  have  been  promoted  on
pensionable posts after 1982 are entitled for pension. 
47.
Ms. Garima Prasad, learned senior counsel appearing
for the UPSRTC would argue that the High Court has completely
misread the contents of GOs dated 07.06.1972 and 05.07.1972
as also the rules and regulations. She would submit that these
GOs  have  not  made  any  specific  provision  concerning
admissibility of pension which is dealt with in the earlier GO
dated  28.10.1960.  She  would  thus  submit  that  GOs  dated
07.06.1972  and  05.07.1972  would  not  be  applicable  to  the
employees of the erstwhile Roadways insofar as entitlement of
pension  is  concerned  and  the  same  is  restricted  to  the
government employees who were absorbed in the services of
the Corporation.

48.
Per  contra,  Mr.  Rakesh  Khanna,  learned  senior
counsel appearing for RKSP would submit that the High Court
has correctly applied the GOs as also the rules and regulations
while allowing the writ petition. He would also submit that the
Division Bench has erred in directing, in the operative part of
the order, that the pension shall be calculated from the date,
employee(s) of the Corporation became member of the cadre of
the  post  which  is  pensionable.  According  to  him,  the entire
length of service should have been calculated for the purpose
of pensionary benefits.  
49.
We have already  discussed  the legal effect  of the
GOs dated 07.06.1972 and 05.07.1972 read along with Clause
(4) of Regulation 39 of the Regulations, 1981. To reiterate, only
those  employees  of  the  State  Government  working  in  the
Roadways who have opted for services of the Corporation shall
be entitled for pension and other retirement benefits in terms of
GO  dated  05.07.1972.  However,  other  employees  of  the
Corporation shall not be entitled to pension, but they shall be
entitled  to  the  retirement  benefits  mentioned  in  sub-
Regulations (1) and (2) of Regulation 39. Thus, it is amply clear

38
that  only  State  Government  employees  absorbed  in  the
Corporation  shall  be  entitled  to  pension,  “phrase  that  their
service conditions shall not be inferior to the conditions as were
available under the Government” would be applicable to the
State  Government  employees  for  the  purposes  of  according
benefit of pension. The employees of Roadways who were not
holding  any  pensionable  post  prior  to  their  deputation  or
absorption in the Corporation, are not entitled to pension, as
their  service  conditions  in  the  erstwhile  Roadways  did  not
provide that they are entitled to pension. Thus, they have not
been put to any inferior service conditions on their joining the
services  in  the  Corporation.  In  our  considered  opinion,  the
Division Bench of the High Court was not correct in holding that
the members of the RKSP are entitled to pension even if they
have been promoted after the cutoff date of 27.08.1982. 
50.
Insofar as the employees who were promoted in the
UPSRTC on a pensionable post between 1972 to 1981, they are
getting pension in view of GO dated 03.02.1984.  This position
has  been  admitted  by  Ms.  Garima  Prasad,  learned  senior
counsel appearing for the UPSRTC. However, the members of
the  Union  of  RKSP  for  whose  benefit  the  writ  petition  was

39
preferred, who were promoted on a pensionable post after the
cutoff date, are not entitled for pension.
51.
Accordingly, we set aside the order passed by the
Division Bench and the learned Single Judge of the Allahabad
High Court under the impugned judgment (s).  Accordingly, the
appeals filed by UPSRTC being  C.A. No. 895 of 2020, C.A. No.
896 of 2020, C.A. No. 897 of 2020, C.A. No. 898 of 2020 and
