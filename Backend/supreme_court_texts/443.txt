FACTS :   
3. 
At this juncture, it is imperative to delve into the factual matrix to 
set out the context of the present proceedings.  
4. 
FIR No. 268 dated 20.06.2004 was registered at Police Station 
Kamla Nagar, Bhopal under Sections 307, 147, 148, and 149 of IPC on 
the statement of Usha Bai (P.W.10). The said Complainant stated that 
on the night of 20.06.2004, at around 9:30 pm, she was overseeing the 
construction of the wall of her Jhuggi (hut) by Devi Singh @ Tillu, and 
Tularam. At that moment, accused persons, Ahmad and his wife, Kanija 
Bi, arrived and objected to the construction. Tillu asserted that it was 
their Jhuggi and they had the right to build the wall. Meanwhile, other 
accused persons, including Vijay, Dharmendra @ Dhamma (Appellant), 
Katchu @ Ramswaroop, Ballu, Ravi, and Asgar, arrived and began 
verbally abusing the Complainant, Tillu, and Tularam. The situation 
intensified as all the accused, including the Appellant, rushed to 
physically assault Tillu. In defence, Tillu sought refuge inside a nearby 
unoccupied Jhuggi belonging to one Bhairav Shastri, locking the door 
from inside. However, the accused forcibly entered Bhairav Shastri's 
Jhuggi by breaking open the door. Once inside, they surrounded Tillu, 
with the Appellant delivering a knife blow to Tillu in his abdomen, while 
Asgar inflicted another blow slightly lower on his stomach. Following 
this, the other accused persons also physically assaulted Tillu using 

 
 
3
their fists and sticks. Meanwhile, Tularam attempted to intervene, but 
he too was subjected to blows from Katchu and Ahmad, resulting in 
injuries to his head and hands. Upon hearing the commotion, residents 
from the locality arrived at the scene, prompting the accused to flee. The 
Complainant further stated that she attempted to intervene but was 
threatened with dire consequences if she did not leave the area. 
5. 
After the incident, Tillu and Tularam, both injured, were taken to 
Katju Hospital for medical aid. The Emergency Medical Officer, Dr. R.S. 
Vijayvargiya (P.W.4), noted Tillu's lack of pulse, as well as two stab 
wounds in his chest and three stab wounds in his abdomen, indicating 
a critical condition. Upon examining Tularam, Dr. Vijayvargiya observed 
severe injuries to the occipital and temporal regions of his head. 
Subsequently, both injured persons were referred to Hamidia Hospital 
for further treatment. 
6. 
Tillu unfortunately succumbed to his injuries and was declared 
dead, while Tularam was still alive and was admitted to Hamidia 
Hospital. 
7. 
Dr. C.S. Jain (P.W. 13) conducted the post-mortem examination 
on Tillu, determining that the cause of death was shock and 
haemorrhage resulting from multiple stab wounds across the body and 
head injuries. The wounds were inflicted by a sharp, penetrating 
weapon, causing the stab injuries, while the head injuries were inflicted 

 
 
4
by a hard and blunt object. The combined injuries to the head and 
abdomen were deemed sufficient to cause death. 
8. 
Girish Bohre, the Investigating Officer (P.W.14), commenced the 
investigation by preparing a spot map (Ex.P.2) and also seized the blood-
stained pieces of the floor from the place of occurrence (Ex.P.31).  
9. 
As Tularam was alive though critically injured, the Investigating 
Officer (P.W. 14) documented his statement (Ex.P.40) under Section 161 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter, ‘CrPC’) wherein 
Tularam recounted the events during the subject incident. Tularam 
mentioned that he and Tillu were constructing the wall of Usha Bai's 
Jhuggi at Navgrah Mandir. Around 9:15 pm, Ahmad and his wife, 
Kanija Bi, approached and opposed the construction. Despite Tillu's 
assertion that it was their wall, Ahmad persisted in preventing them. 
Shortly after, Vijay, Dharmendra @ Dhamma (Appellant), Katchu @ 
Ramaswaroop, Ballu, Ravi, and Asgar arrived, initiating verbal abuse. 
The accused then assaulted Tillu, who sought refuge inside Bhairav 
Shastri's nearby Jhuggi, locking himself inside. The assailants forcibly 
entered and surrounding Tillu, Dhamma (Appellant) inflicted a knife 
blow to Tillu's abdomen, while Asgar also stabbed him near the navel. 
Additionally, the other accused engaged in physical assault using 
sticks, lathis, and fists. When Tularam attempted to intervene, Katchu 
and Ahmad struck him with sticks, inflicting injuries to his head, 

 
 
5
hands, and body. Tularam noted that Lallu (P.W.11) and one Ramesh 
were eyewitnesses to the incident. 
10. 
Tularam too passed away approximately five days after 
undergoing surgery in Hamidia Hospital. Dr. Neelam Srivastava 
(P.W.15) conducted his post-mortem examination, concluding that the 
cause of death was cardio-respiratory failure resulting from a head 
injury. Moreover, the severity of the injury was such that it could have 
led to death under normal circumstances. This injury, deemed 
homicidal, was inflicted by hard, blunt, and heavy objects. 
11. 
During the course of investigation, the Investigating Officer (P.W. 
14), following a disclosure statement (Ex.P.14) made by the Appellant, 
recovered a knife, which the Appellant had concealed in Barrack No. 2 
of Police Line Nehru Nagar. Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11) was a witness 
to this recovery. The knife was then submitted for forensic examination 
(Ex.P.39), where the human blood on the knife was detected but the 
blood group classification was inconclusive. 
12. 
After the investigation, all the accused persons, including the 
Appellant, were charged under Sections 147, 148, 302/149, 307/149 
of IPC. 
13. 
In the trial, the prosecution examined as many as 15 witnesses to 
bring the guilt home, including Usha Bai, P.W.10 (Complainant) and 

 
 
6
Lallu Vishwakarma, P.W.11, both eyewitnesses. The prosecution case 
is largely based upon the version of these two eyewitnesses, who 
claimed that the fatal blows were caused to the victims in front of them.  
14. 
The Trial Court, having found the version of the two eyewitnesses 
(P.W.10 and P.W.11) to be trustworthy, which was duly corroborated by 
the testimony of the Investigating Officer (P.W.14), the medical evidence 
and the recovery of the weapon, held the Appellant guilty of offences 
under Sections 302, 147, 148, and 149 of IPC and sentenced him to 
undergo life imprisonment. 
15. 
The High Court, vide the impugned judgment, upheld the 
Appellant’s conviction under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the 
IPC, though it has acquitted him under Sections 147 and 148 of the 
IPC. The High Court has held that: (i) The presence of the Appellant 
stood established through the testimony of Lallu Vishwakarma 
(P.W.11), and his cross-examination further confirms that there was no 
motive for falsely incriminating the Appellant; (ii) The allegations against 
the Appellant, as detailed by eyewitnesses Usha Bai (P.W.10) and Lallu 
Vishwakarma (P.W.11), were duly corroborated by the medical opinions 
of Dr. C.S. Jain (P.W.13) and Dr. Neelam Shrivastava (P.W.15); (iii) The 
statement given by deceased Tularam, as recorded by P.W.14, aligns 
with other evidence relied upon for conviction; (iv) The weapon (knife) 
was seized based on the disclosure statement of the Appellant, making 

 
 
7
the recovery admissible under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 
1872 (hereinafter, ‘IEA’); and (v) the testimony of Investigating Officer, 
P.W.14, also corroborated the weapon's seizure. 
16. 
Discontented with his conviction, the Appellant is in appeal before 
us. 
CONTENTIONS OF PARTIES : 
17. 
Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant, 
argued that the High Court erred in upholding the Appellant’s 
conviction under Section 302/34 IPC. Substantiating this, he made the 
following submissions: 
a) 
The prosecution's case presented inherent contradictions. On 
the one hand, the two eyewitnesses (P.W.10 and P.W.11), relied 
upon by the courts below, testified that the entire incident 
unfolded inside Bhairav Shastri's Jhuggi, situated near that of 
the Complainant, (P.W.10). On the other hand, the Investigating 
Officer (P.W.14), during his cross-examination, stated that no 
quarrel took place near P.W.10's Jhuggi, and that there was no 
‘Bhairon Baba Temple’ or residence near the site of occurrence. 
It was argued that since the incident admittedly occurred inside 
a Jhuggi, it is unbelievable that the eyewitnesses could have 
seen it. 

 
 
8
b) 
It was contended that the presence of the Appellant at the place 
of incident is stoutly disputed, and such an inference can be 
well drawn from the statement of the Complainant herself. The 
incident took place around 9:30 pm, posing visibility challenges 
for the witnesses. Usha Bai (the Complainant, P.W.10) has 
deposed that she was familiar with accused Ahamd, Asghar Ali, 
Ravi, and Kanija Bi but was aware of the other accused by name 
only. This clearly indicates that P.W.10 was not acquainted with 
the Appellant. Barring the eyewitness account, there is no other 
credible evidence to suggest that the Appellant was present or 
participated in the occurrence.  
c) 
Further, the knife injury could not be attributed to the 
Appellant, as testified by Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11), who 
explicitly stated that he couldn’t discern who assaulted whom. 
d) 
That apart, it was urged that the weapon confiscated from the 
Appellant 
underwent 
a 
Forensic 
Science 
Laboratory 
(hereinafter, ‘FSL’) examination, producing inconclusive 
results, which bolsters the Appellant’s case that he was falsely 
implicated. 
e) 
Finally, it was canvassed that the statement of the deceased 
Tularam, recorded by Investigating Officer Girish Bohre 
(P.W.14) under Section 161 CrPC, could not have been 

 
 
9
considered a ‘dying declaration’ due to the absence of 
certification from the doctor regarding Tularam's mental fitness. 
f) 
Even otherwise, a dying declaration made before the 
Investigating Officer/ Police is always shrouded by suspicious 
circumstances and no reliance thereupon can be made. 
18. 
Per Contra, Ms. Mrinal Gopal Elker, learned counsel on behalf of 
the State, argued that the impugned judgment dated 19.12.2017 does 
not warrant any interference by this Court. She submitted as follows: 
a) 
The Courts below have expressly affirmed the presence of the 
Appellant at the site of incident and his involvement in the 
occurrence, based on the testimony of Lallu Vishwakarma 
(P.W.11). She argued that Vishwakarma's cross-examination 
provides no reason to doubt his version qua the Appellant.  
b) 
There is a specific accusation against the Appellant of inflicting 
the knife blow on the deceased Tillu's abdomen, which is 
supported by the Medical Legal Certificate (MLC) conducted by 
Dr. R.S. Vijayvargiya (P.W.4), who confirmed the presence of a 
stab wound on the abdomen with profuse bleeding.  
c) 
After he was apprehended, the Appellant voluntarily disclosed 
the location of the concealed knife to the Investigating Officer 

 
 
10
in the presence of witnesses. Such a recovery is admissible in 
evidence as an incriminating material against the Appellant.  
d) 
Finally, Ms. Elker highlighted that the courts below have rightly 
considered the statement of deceased Tularam recorded under 
Section 161 of CrPC as a ‘dying declaration’, corroborating the 
prosecution’s case against the Appellant beyond any doubt. 
ANALYSIS : 
19. 
Having heard learned Senior Counsel/Counsel for the parties at a 
considerable length and on perusal of the statements of eyewitnesses 
along with other relevant material on record, we find that the following 
three questions fall for our consideration in the present appeal: 
A. 
Have the Courts below erred in not appreciating the 
contradictions or discrepancies which would dislodge the 
prosecution’s case? 
B. 
Is the absence of blood group classification or inconclusive FSL 
results 
on 
the 
recovered 
weapon 
detrimental 
to 
the 
prosecution’s case? 
C. 
Does the Investigating Officer’s failure to obtain a fitness 
certificate from the medical officer invalidate the consideration 
of the statement of Tularam recorded under Section 161 CrPC 
before his death, as a ‘dying declaration’? 

 
 
11
 
A.  
CONTRADICTIONS IN THE PROSECUCTION’S CASE:  
20. 
Since the prosecution case against the Appellant predominantly 
hinges upon the testimonies of Usha Bai (P.W.10), Lallu Vishwakarma 
(P.W.11), Dr. C.S. Jain (P.W.13), Dr. Neelam Shrivastava (P.W.15) and 
Girish Bohre (P.W.14), we deem it appropriate to briefly summarise their 
testimonies hereunder: 
21. 
Usha Bai (P.W.10) swore that on 20.06.2004, around 9.00 p.m., 
she was overseeing the construction of wall of her Jhuggi by Devi Singh 
alias Tillu and Tularam. Ahmad and Kanija Bi, two of the accused, 
arrived and ordered them to halt construction. Following this, Ahmad 
struck Tularam on the head with a lathi. Subsequently, Asgar, Ahmad’s 
son, incited the other accused to attack, prompting all the accused to 
rush in and assault Tillu, Tularam, and Lalaram with various weapons 
like sticks, rods, and pipes. When P.W.10 attempted to intervene by 
grabbing Ahmad’s lathi, she was verbally abused and told to step aside. 
Consequently, she retreated to the sidelines. The accused continued to 
beat Tillu and Tularam until they were incapacitated. Tillu succumbed 
to his injuries at the scene, while Tularam was barely breathing. 
Immediately after the incident, Tillu, Tularam, and Lalaram were 
rushed to Hamidia Hospital for treatment by the Kamla Nagar Police 
Station. Tillu passed away en route to the hospital. P.W.10 lodged a First 
Information Report (FIR) (Ex.P.7) detailing the incident. 

 
 
12
22. 
Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11) recounted that the incident occurred 
near a wall owned by Usha Bai (P.W.10). Around 8-9:30 pm, Ahmad 
arrived wielding a lathi at the place of construction of Usha Bai’s wall, 
where P.W.11 and Tillu were sharing a meal. Ahmad confronted them, 
objecting to the wall’s construction. In response, Tillu urged them to 
allow the construction to proceed. Subsequently, all the other accused 
arrived and assaulted Tillu and another individual, although P.W.11 
couldn’t discern the specific assailants. The accused wielded various 
weapons such as lathis, knives, sticks, rods, and pipes during the 
attack. Tillu was found injured inside Bhairon Baba’s room, while 
Tularam lay injured at the construction site. P.W.11 then arranged for 
the injured to be transported in an auto. He noted that Tillu’s intestines 
were protruding, which he wrapped in cloth and placed in the auto. 
Additionally, Tularam had suffered traumatic and haemorrhagic shock 
due to multiple injuries. The injured were then taken to Hamidia 
Hospital. The Police subsequently confiscated the knife and sticks from 
the Appellant (Ex.P.14) and prepared a memorandum, which P.W.11 
signed. 
23. 
In addition to the two eyewitnesses, the prosecution so as to lend 
corroboration to the ocular evidence, called upon medical experts, 
namely Dr. C.S. Jain (P.W.13) and Dr. Neelam Shrivastava (P.W.15), 

 
 
13
who conducted the post-mortem examinations of Tillu and Tularam, 
respectively. 
24. 
Dr. C.S. Jain, P.W.13, reported that Tillu’s body was brought in 
for post-mortem examination on 21.06.2004, revealing four stab 
wounds on the front side of the abdomen, along with a laceration on the 
head and three abrasions. He concluded that the stab wounds were 
inflicted by a hard, sharp, and penetrating weapon, while the head 
injuries were caused by a hard and blunt object. The combined injuries 
to the head and abdomen were deemed sufficient to cause death.  
25. 
Dr. Neelam Shrivastava, P.W.15, testified that Tularam’s body was 
brought for post-mortem examination on 24.06.2004, revealing 
multiple radial fractures, subdural subarachnoid haemorrhage, and 
various wounds. She concluded that Tularam’s death resulted from 
respiratory failure due to a head injury and its associated 
complications. The severity of the injury was sufficient to cause death 
in the ordinary course of nature, and it was determined to be homicidal, 
inflicted by a hard, blunt, and heavy weapon. During cross-
examination, she clarified that Tularam did not sustain any injuries 
from knives or swords on his body. 
26. 
The prosecution also examined Girish Bohre, Investigating Officer 
(P.W.14), of the subject incident. He testified how the investigation was 
conducted, a spot map (Ex.P.2) of the location was prepared, and a 

 
 
14
blood-stained piece of flooring was also seized from the place of the 
incident. Additionally, he conducted a panchnama on Tillu’s dead body 
(Ex.P.32). He apprehended the Appellant and interrogated him in the 
presence of witnesses. During interrogation, the Appellant confessed to 
hiding the knife used in the assault in Barrack No. 2 of the Police Line 
Nehru Nagar. P.W.14 then drafted a memorandum, leading to the 
recovery of an iron knife at the instance of the Appellant. Following this, 
he arrested the Appellant and other co-accused. P.W.14 also prepared 
a panchnama (Ex.P.34) of Tularam’s dead body. 
27. 
It is pertinent to mention at this stage that Ajjharruddin (P.W.1), 
Sukhram (P.W.2), and Reshambai (P.W.3) were also brought in as 
eyewitnesses to the incident. However, they were deemed hostile by the 
prosecution, as according to them, no incident occurred in their 
presence. 
28. 
It is noteworthy to mention here that during the trial of the 
Appellant and other co-accused, one of the accused, Vijay Singh 
absconded. Subsequent to the judgment of the Trial Court in 2005, that 
Vijay Singh was apprehended and tried. The Trial Court vide another 
judgment delivered in the year 2007, convicted him based on the 
testimony of eyewitness Usha Bai (P.W.10), duly supported by the 
medical opinions of Dr. C.S. Jain (P.W.13) and Dr. Neelam Shrivastava 

 
 
15
(P.W.15) as well as the testimony of Girish Bohre, the Investigating 
Officer (P.W.14). 
29. 
Having elaborated on the testimonies of the key witnesses in the 
instant case, we may now dredge up the contradictions highlighted on 
behalf of the Appellant. 
A.1 BHAIRAV SHASTRI’S JHUGGI  
 
30. 
It was vehemently agitated that there is a latent dissension in the 
testimonies of the witnesses regarding the location of the occurrence. 
While Usha Bai, P.W.10 and Lallu Vishwakarma, P.W.11, deposed that 
the deceased Tillu entered the Jhuggi of Bhairav Shastri, where he was 
subsequently surrounded and assaulted in the abdomen by the 
Appellant wielding a knife, the Investigating Officer (P.W.14) veraciously 
admitted during cross-examination that he was unaware of any 
individual named Bhairon Baba residing near the scene of the incident. 
The I.O. further clarified that there was no house or temple associated 
with Bhairon Baba in the vicinity of the incident, which is why he did 
not name it in the spot map (Ex.P.2). 
31. 
We have thoroughly scrutinized the testimonies of the witnesses 
in this regard. We find a consistent mention of Bhairav Shastri across 
all prosecution accounts, with Bhairav Shastri also being loosely 
referred to as Bhairon Baba. Lallu Vishwakarma, P.W. 11, has 

 
 
16
unerringly stated in his testimony that the deceased Tillu was 
discovered inside Bhairon Baba's room following the incident. 
Additionally, the presence of Bhairon Shastri's Jhuggi is noted in 
Section 161 CrPC statement of the deceased Tularam recorded by Girish 
Bohre, the Investigating Officer (P.W.14), wherein he unequivocally 
stated that Tillu sought refuge inside Bhairav Shastri's hut and locked 
himself in. The mention of Bhairon Shastri's Jhuggi is also evident in 
the FIR (Ex.P.7) filed by the Complainant, P.W.10, as well as in her 
statement (Ex.D.1) recorded under Section 161 CrPC. 
32. 
It is true that while Girish Bohre (P.W.14), as per his statement, 
was unaware of any Bhairon Baba near the scene of occurrence, the 
location referred to as ‘Bhairon Shastri's Jhuggi’ by the other witnesses 
is indeed depicted on the spot map (Ex.P.2) prepared by him. A plain 
examination of the spot map (Ex.P.2) reveals a marked structure 
labelled ‘B’, identified as a `brick room’ where the deceased took refuge. 
Even though the said structure is not captioned as Bhairav Shastri's 
Jhuggi or by any other name, it gives credence to the version of the eye 
witnesses that Tillu was attacked in the neighbouring Jhuggi. Moreover, 
the defence has not disputed the depictions in the spot map while cross-
examining the I.O. (P.W.14).  
33. 
A mere omission on the part of the Investigating Officer in marking 
a spot on the site plan does not deflect the prosecution’s case. It is well-

 
 
17
established that the site plan merely denotes the location of the incident 
without implying further details.1 In light of the fact that the persons 
who had seen that to which they have testified, due weightage must be 
given to their first-hand version. Their evidence cannot be jettisoned 
merely because the I.O. forgot to describe the room as ‘Bhairav Shastri’s 
Jhuggi’ on the spot map. 
34. 
It is a case where eyewitnesses have corroborated each other; their 
depositions are reinforced by deceased Tularam himself in his 
statement recorded under Section 161 CrPC, and the location of the 
incident is depicted on the spot map (Ex.P.2) as a `brick room’. It, thus, 
stands established that there was another Jhuggi where the deceased 
sought 
refuge 
and 
was 
eventually 
assaulted. 
Given 
these 
circumstances, the so-called contradiction miserably fails to invade the 
corpus delicti. 
A.2 LEGAL EFFECT OF NON-READING OF CONTENTS OF FIR TO THE 
COMPLAINANT  
35. 
It was then argued that the Complainant, Usha Bai (P.W.10), in 
her cross-examination, has candidly admitted that the FIR (Ex.P.7) was 
not read out to her and she put her thumb impression under the 
instructions of the Police. Reliance is placed on her deposition during 
 
1 Shivanna v. State of Hunsur Town Police (2010) 15 SCC 91. 

 
 
18
cross-examination where she claims to have thumb marked on a blank 
paper, whereupon Ex.P.7 was prepared. 
36. 
In order to appreciate the contention, we have gone through the 
translated version of the statement of Usha Bai (P.W.10), which the 
Appellant has appended along with the original paper book as well as a 
part of “Compilation of Depositions of Witnesses”. Since the translated 
version was seemingly incorrect, making it difficult to discern as to what 
the witness had deposed, we have also gone through the original Hindi 
version of Usha Bai’s (P.W.10) statement. 
37. 
The statement of a witness has to be extolled in its entirety. It may 
be recapitulated that Usha Bai (P.W.10), in her complaint which led to 
the registration of the subject FIR, had categorically stated that, “Vijay, 
Dharmendra @ Dhamma, Katchu @ Ramswaroop, Ballu, Ravi, Asgar all 
came shouting that Tillu was indulging in Dadagiri and he be finished 
today……...” The FIR further states that, “ye sabhee log” [all these 
persons] started attacking, Tillu ran towards Bhairav Shastri’s Jhuggi, 
entered and closed the door from inside to save himself. “Sabhee ne” (all 
of them) forcefully broke the door open and entered the Jhuggi and 
surrounded Tillu ….. and Dharmendra @ Dhamma (Appellant) then 
gave a knife blow in the abdomen of Tillu. 
38. 
It must also be borne in mind that FIR is not a substantive piece 
of evidence, and it can be used only to corroborate or contradict the 

 
 
19
version of an Informant. It is also not necessary that there should 
always be a written complaint to register the FIR. Even an oral 
communication to the Police disclosing the commission of a cognizable 
offence is sufficient to register the FIR. 
39. 
The object of the FIR is three-fold: firstly, to inform the 
jurisdictional Magistrate and the Police Administration of the offence 
that has been reported to the Police Station; secondly, to acquaint the 
Judicial Officer before whom the case is ultimately tried as to what are 
the actual facts stated immediately after the occurrence and on what 
materials the investigation commenced; thirdly and most importantly, 
to safeguard the accused against subsequent variations, exaggerations 
or additions. 
40. 
The subject FIR (Ex.P.7) fully satisfies all the ingredients of 
Section 154 CrPC. The occurrence is reported to have taken place on 
20.06.2004 at 9.30 p.m., and the FIR was recorded on the same day at 
10.45 p.m. The names of all the eight accused who allegedly 
participated in the occurrence are duly recorded. The FIR is written in 
a natural, consistent flow of handwriting, with no signs of spaces being 
left, words being overwritten or shrunken, or any word or sentence 
being interpolated. The last line of the FIR categorically records that the 
report was read out and explained to the Informant. The FIR is in the 

 
 
20
prescribed format and Usha Bai (P.W.10) has thereafter put her thumb 
impression. 
41. 
It is true that during her cross-examination, Usha Bai (P.W.10), 
has claimed that the Police neither read out the FIR (Ex.P.7) to her nor 
did it mention the contents of her statements which were recorded by 
the Police on 5-6 occasions. She further stated that it could not be 
determined what version was included in Ex.P.7 since she is not a 
literate person. It seems that the Appellant made an overt attempt to 
influence the witness. However, despite Usha Bai’s innocuous intent to 
help the Appellant from the wrath of law, she could not deny the fact 
that the FIR was registered on her complaint or that Tillu and Tularam 
suffered fatal injuries in the occurrence reported by her. 
42. 
 Assuming that the Police failed to read out or apprise the 
informant about the contents of the FIR, the question that falls for 
consideration is whether such omission has caused any prejudice to the 
Appellant? In our considered opinion, the answer has to be in the 
negative. This is not a case where the Appellant was not provided with 
a copy of the FIR or the charge sheet, which could have hindered his 
ability to effectively cross-examine the Informant. The record reveals 
that Shri A.K. Shrivastava, Advocate, cross-examined Usha Bai (P.W.10) 
on behalf of the Appellant. Usha Bai did try to help the Appellant by not 
disclosing his name as one of the accused, but she could not hide the 

 
 
21
fact that besides Ahmad, Asgar, Ravi and Kanija Bi, she also knew the 
other accused by their names. The Appellant is admittedly one of those 
accused. She has further deposed that sabhee ne (all of them) assaulted 
Tillu with lathi, rods and pipes. She further stated that when she tried 
to intervene, Ahmad abused her and threatened to kill her. She then 
went and stood at some distance and witnessed that those aaropigan, 
i.e., all the accused, had given fatal assaults to Tillu and Tularam. Most 
importantly, she further testified that she, along with Lalaram, then 
went to the Police Station Kamla Nagar, whereafter the Police Officials 
immediately sent Lalaram and Tularam for treatment at Hamidia 
Hospital. Tillu, however, could not reach the hospital as he succumbed 
to the injuries on the way. Additionally, in paragraph 4 of her 
deposition, Usha Bai (P.W.10) unmistakably states that she reported 
the matter to Police Station Kamla Nagar through Ex.P.7, which is 
thumb marked by her. This part of her deposition has not been 
questioned by the Appellant while cross-examining Usha Bai (P.W.10). 
We have also gone through the Appellant’s own statement recorded 
under Section 313 CrPC. Aside from a vague denial and claims of false 
implication, there is no suggestion that he was not present at the scene; 
that he did not participate in the incident, or that he was falsely 
implicated for any reason. The Appellant, thus, has failed to 
demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the alleged non-reading of the 

 
 
22
contents of the FIR to the Informant. The contention raised in this 
regard is entirely misconceived. 
43. 
Be that as it may, this Court in State v. N.S. Gnaneswaran2 has 
ruled that the stipulations outlined in Section 154 CrPC concerning the 
reading over of the information after it is written down, the signing of 
the said information by the informant, and the entry of its substance in 
the prescribed manner are not obligatory. These requirements are 
procedural in nature, and the omission of any of them does not impact 
the legal consequences resulting from the information provided under 
the section. 
44. 
It is equally well-settled that when the testimonies of eyewitnesses 
are consistent, unimpeachable, and duly corroborated by medical 
evidence or the recovery of incriminating material like the weapon used, 
the deficiencies, if any, in the recording of FIR alone do not constitute a 
valid ground to overturn the conviction or undermine the prosecution 
case. 
A.3   PRESENCE OF APPELLANT ON THE PLACE OF OCCURRENCE 
 
45. 
Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant argued that it is a case 
of false implication as the presence of the Appellant at the spot of 
occurrence has not been established beyond doubt. He relied upon the 
 
2 (2013) 3 SCC 594. 

 
 
23
statement of Usha Bai (P.W.10), who, in the opening statement of her 
examination-in-chief, named Ahmad, Asgar, Ravi and Kanija Bi as 
accused and claimed that she did not know anyone else. It was 
highlighted that Usha Bai (P.W.10) not only failed to name the Appellant 
in her entire statement but also admitted during the cross-examination 
that she never provided the names of the assailants, as mentioned by 
the Police in the FIR (Ex.P.7). 
46. 
We are, however, not impressed by the submission. We say so for 
the following reasons : 
(a) 
The statement of Usha Bai (P.W.10) has to be read and 
appreciated in its entirety and not in piecemeal.  
(b) 
She, as discussed earlier, deposed that she knew the remaining 
accused by name. She was indisputably referring to the 
remaining accused who were present in court which included 
the Appellant as well. 
(c) 
She deposed that “all the accused” attacked Lalaram, Tularam 
and Devi Singh @ Tillu with dandas, rods and pipes. 
(d) 
She further deposed that all the accused assaulted Tillu and 
Tularam with the intention to kill them. 

 
 
24
(e) 
She also admitted that she went to Police Station Kamla Nagar 
and got the FIR (Ex.P.7) lodged, which bore her thumb 
impression.  
(f) 
Having admitted these material facts, it would be too far-fetched 
to dissect Usha Bai’s version to hold that the Appellant was not 
present or participated in the occurrence. 
(g) 
In any case, Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11), another eyewitness, 
explicitly stated that the Appellant was present and he 
participated in the incident by delivering a knife blow to Tillu's 
abdomen. 
(h) 
The knife injury attributed to the Appellant has been duly 
established by Dr. R.S. Vijayvargiya (P.W.4) and Dr. C.S. Jain 
(P.W.13). 
(i) 
The Investigating Officer (P.W.14) successfully established the 
recovery of the weapon of offence, namely a knife, based on the 
Appellant's disclosure statement. Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11), 
who witnessed the recovery, supported the Investigating 
Officer's testimony. 
(j) 
To dispel any doubts, Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11) identified the 
Appellant in court and specifically pointed out, "The person 
standing in front wearing a check shirt is Dharmendra".  

 
 
25
47. 
It is trite law that identification tests (TIP) do not serve as 
substantive evidence but are primarily intended to assist the 
investigating agency in ensuring that their progress in investigating the 
offence is on the correct path. Holding a TIP is not obligatory. Further, 
a failure to hold TIP cannot be a ground to eschew the testimony of 
witnesses whose evidence was concurrently accepted by the trial and 
appellate courts.3 Additionally, a failure to hold a parade would not 
make inadmissible the evidence of identification in the court.4 
48. 
Similarly, the contention of poor visibility owing to darkness at the 
spot of occurrence is also not tenable. In analysing the incidents 
occurring at night, this Court in Nathuni Yadav v. State of Bihar5 
has taken into account several factors, including:  
(i) 
The proximity at which the assailants would have confronted 
the injured.  
(ii) The possibility of some ambient light reaching the scene from 
the stars.  
(iii)  The familiarity of the witnesses with the appearance of each 
assailant. 
 
3 State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu, (2005) 11 SCC 600. 
4 Heera v. State of Rajasthan, (2007) 10 SCC 175. 
5 (1998) 9 SCC 238. 

 
 
26
49. 
In the instant case, firstly, the place of occurrence, i.e., Bharav 
Shastri’s Jhuggi, was adjacent to that of the Complainant (P.W.10) 
making it easier for the witnesses to observe and identify the accused 
persons. Secondly, each accused, particularly the Appellant, was 
familiar to the eyewitnesses. Thirdly, considering that the incident 
occurred on a summer night, there would have been minimal 
obstruction to visibility for the witnesses. Fourthly and most 
importantly, the Appellant, in his 313 CrPC Statement, has nowhere 
taken the plea of alibi. He did not pursue this defence during the cross-
examination of witnesses either.  
50. 
There is no gainsaying that whosoever pleads alibi in contrast and 
derogation of the eyewitness version, is under cumbrous onus to prove 
absence from the scene and time of crime. The Appellant not only failed 
to raise this defence but also did not adduce any evidence in support 
thereof. Taking into consideration the cumulative effect of all these 
factors, we have no reason to doubt that the Appellant was not only 
present at the scene of crime, but he actively participated also in the 
occurrence and gave one of the fatal blows to Tillu (deceased). 
51. 
We cannot overlook the fact that in a situation where two people 
are killed in a heated altercation, it is highly unlikely that the 
eyewitnesses would want the real perpetrators to escape justice. In the 
absence of any prior motive, it is not plausible that they would falsely 

 
 
27
accuse the Appellant in this case. This is not a scenario where the 
Complainant or P.W.11 held grudges against the Appellant and 
fabricated a story to implicate him after the incident. Rather, the name 
of the Appellant surfaced in the very first version, duly recorded vide 
Ex.P.7, within less than two hours of the occurrence. Pertinently, no 
motive to falsely implicate the Appellant has been suggested during the 
cross-examination of the eyewitnesses. 
A.4   ATTRIBUTION OF KNIFE INJURY ON THE APPELLANT  
52. 
It was maintained by Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant 
that since the incident took place inside the Jhuggi and at night, it is 
highly improbable that the witnesses could see the manner in which the 
incident took place. Further, reliance was placed on the statement of 
Lallu Vishwakarma, P.W.11, who stated that he could not see who 
assaulted whom, and he could not tell which weapon was seized from 
whom. It was, thus, asserted that there is not even an iota of evidence 
to conclude that the knife injury was caused by the Appellant.  
53. 
We have deeply analysed the submission. It is essential for this 
Court to examine the Disclosure Statement (Ex.P.14) of the Appellant, 
which resulted in the discovery of the weapon (knife) in question. The 
statement reads as under: 
“On 20.04.2004, I along with my companions 
Ahmad, Asgar, Ravi, Vijay, Katchu @Ramswaroop, 

 
 
28
Ballu, and Kanija Bi committed Maarpeet with Tillu 
@ Devi Singh with knife and stick voluntarily, the 
knife, by which Tillu @ Devising was assaulted by 
me, has been hidden by me in the Barrack No. 2 of 
Police Line Nehru Nagar. Come with me, I will hand 
over it to you.” 
54. 
The disclosure statement made by the Appellant led to the 
discovery and subsequent seizure of the knife, namely, the weapon of 
offence. Subsequently, a seizure memo (Ex.P.20) was prepared, which 
stated as follows: 
“One knife made of iron with wooden handle the 
total length of which is about 14 ½ inches, the 
length of handle is about 4 ¾ inches and length of 
blade is about 10 inches and width of blade is about 
1 ¼ inches, the tip of knife is pointed, blood is 
present in the front (agla) part of the blade which 
has 
dried 
up. 
On 
producing 
by 
accused 
Dharmendra @ Dhamma, the same was taken in 
possession of Police and sealed pack on the spot 
itself as evidence.” 
55. 
The question that requires determination is whether the above-
stated disclosure statement is admissible in evidence? The issue 
regarding the admissibility of a disclosure statement within the 
meaning of Section 27 of the IEA was comprehensively addressed by 
this Court in Pulukuri Kottaya v. Emperor,6 delineating the following 
briefly summed up criteria:  
(i) 
There should be a discovery of the fact. 
 
6 1946 SCC OnLine PC 47. 

 
 
29
(ii) 
The discovery of fact should be in consequence of information 
received from a person accused of an offence. 
(iii) 
The person giving the information should be in the custody of 
a Police Officer. 
(iv) 
Only that portion of information which relates distinctly or 
strictly to the fact discovered can be proved. 
56. 
The testimony of the Investigating Officer (P.W.14) unfolds that 
the Appellant voluntarily made the disclosure statement while he was 
in police custody, pursuant to which the weapon of offence (knife) was 
recovered. Whether the said statement was made voluntarily or was 
secured through coercion is essentially a question of fact. In this regard, 
the testimony of Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11) assumes significance as 
the disclosure statement was duly witnessed by him. In our considered 
opinion, the disclosure statement of the Appellant to the extent it led to 
the recovery of a knife fulfils the basic tenets of Section 27 of IEA and 
has been correctly admitted in evidence. 
57. 
We may hasten to add at this stage that the prosecution version 
was not only accepted by the Trial Court but the High Court has also 
affirmed it in appeal. In our quest to find out whether the Appellant is 
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, we have expanded the wings of our 
limited jurisdiction and assumed the role akin to that of the 1st Appellate 

 
 
30
Court. We are conscious of the fact that the jurisdictional magnification 
ought to be an exception and be invoked with great circumspection, in 
a case of extreme hardship, after taking into consideration the socio-
economic conditions of the victim(s) of a crime, the accused, as well as 
the vulnerable witnesses. Keeping such parameters in view, it cannot 
be ignored that both eyewitnesses, P.W.10 and P.W.11, are illiterate 
labourers, and their testimonies were recorded after a considerable 
length of time had passed since the occurrence. Both the witnesses have 
emphatically denied that they were tutored by Police or anyone else. The 
unfiltered testimony of a rustic witness, even if marred with some minor 
inconsistencies or discrepancies, cannot debilitate its perseverance. The 
evidence of such witnesses has to be evaluated comprehensively and 
carefully, especially when the cross-examination discreetly suggests 
that the accused person(s) did make a bid to win them over by exerting 
some extraneous pressure. We are, thus, satisfied that the statements 
of P.W.10 and P.W.11 do not suffer from the discrepancy of such a 
nature that they should be discarded. Even the testimony of the 
Investigating Officer (P.W.14) is devoid of any ulterior motive or attempt 
to fabricate evidence or falsely implicate the Appellant and his co-
accused. 
58. 
It would be too unfair and unreasonable to expect a witness, 
unless parroted, to recall every minute detail of the occurrence and 

 
 
31
present it with a totally accumulative narrative. The Appellant’s 
contention is thus bereft of any merit. 
 
B.  
EFFECT 
OF ABSENCE 
OF BLOOD GROUP CLASSIFICATION 
ON 
 
PROSECUTION’S CASE 
59. 
Learned Senior Counsel on behalf of Appellant asserted that the 
knife purportedly retrieved from him underwent examination at the 
Forensic Science Laboratory, where the test results were inconclusive, 
particularly regarding the determination of the blood group on the 
weapon. Consequently, the absence of a conclusive match in the blood 
group analysis should be construed in favour of the Appellant and 
against the prosecution.  
60. 
Upon a thorough examination of the FSL report, it stands 
confirmed that the blood group classification test conducted on the 
recovered knife yielded inconclusive results. However, it is crucial to 
note that human blood was detected on the knife recovered at the 
instance of the Appellant (Exhibit “I” before FSL). This fact gains some 
importance, considering that various weapons, including lathis and 
even the knife attributed to accused Asgar, underwent an FSL 
examination, yet, no traces of human blood were found on them. 
Notably, human blood was solely found on the knife used by the 
Appellant.  

 
 
32
61. 
In line with the precedents set forth by this Court in Raja @ 
Rajinder v. State of Haryana7 and John Pandian v. State8, the non-
explanation of human blood on the weapon of crime constitutes a 
circumstance against the accused. It is incumbent upon the accused to 
provide an explanation regarding the presence of human blood on the 
weapon. The Appellant has failed to do so. The judgments delivered by 
both the Trial Court and the High Court also do not reveal that the 
Appellant rendered any satisfactory explanation concerning the 
presence of blood on the recovered knife. While it may not be a decisive 
factor to determine the guilt, but a conspicuous silence does lend 
support to the prosecution case. 
 
C. 
CONSIDERATION OF SECTION 161 CRPC STATEMENT OF DECEASED 
TULARAM AS DYING DECLARATION 
62. 
It is contended on behalf of the Appellant that the courts below 
have erred in relying on the statement of Tularam (Ex.P.40) given to 
Investigating Officer, Girish Bohre (P.W.14) and that the said statement 
cannot be considered to be a ‘dying declaration’ as the Investigating 
Officer did not take any certification from the doctor regarding the 
fitness of mind of Tularam.  
 
7 (2015) 11 SCC 43. 
8 (2010) 14 SCC 129. 

 
 
33
63. 
In this regard, the following part of the testimony of Investigating 
Officer, Girish Bohre (P.W.14), who recorded the statement of Tularam 
under Section 161 CrPC, becomes quintessential:  
“It is correct that I did not take permission from the 
Doctor about the condition of giving statement of 
Tularam before recording statement of Tularam. It 
is correct that I knew this fact at the time of 
recording statement that one person has died in 
this case. As head injury was not told to be serious 
in the Medical Report, so it is incorrect to say that 
I knew this fact that Tularam had sustained lathi 
blow on his head and his condition was serious. It 
is incorrect to say that head injury caused to 
Tularam was serious and his condition was told to 
be serious in his medical report. It is correct that 
proceedings of recording dying declaration of 
Tularam was not conducted by me till Tularam was 
alive. It is incorrect to say that Tularam was not 
able to speak after sustaining the injuries and till 
his death, so I did not record his dying declaration. 
It is incorrect to say that due to this reason the 
statement of Exhibit P.40 has been falsely 
prepared.” 
64. 
Before we proceed further, it would be apt to recapitulate Section 
32(1) of the IEA, whereunder the statement made by a person, who is 
dead, as to the cause of his death or as to any of the circumstances of 
the transaction which resulted in his death, is relevant and admissible, 
irrespective of the fact that such person at the time of making the 
statement was not under expectation of death. 
65. 
Section 161 CrPC empowers the Police to examine orally any 
person who is acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case 

 
 
34
under investigation.  The Police may reduce such statement into writing 
also.  Section 162(1) CrPC, nonetheless, mandates that no statement 
made by any person to a Police Officer, if reduced to writing, be signed 
by the person making it, nor shall such statement be used in evidence 
except to contradict a witness in the manner provided by Section 145 of 
the IEA.  However, Sub-Section (2) of Section 162 CrPC carves out an 
exception to Sub-Section (1) as it explicitly provides that nothing in 
Section 162 shall be deemed to apply to any statement falling within the 
ambit of clause (1) of Section 32 of the IEA.  In other words, a statement 
made by a person who is dead, as to the cause of his death or to the 
circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, to a Police 
Officer and which has been recorded under Section 161 CrPC, shall be 
relevant and admissible, notwithstanding the express bar against use 
of such statement in evidence contained therein.  In such eventuality, 
the statement recorded under Section 161 CrPC assumes the character 
of a dying declaration.  Since extraordinary credence has been given to 
such dying declaration, the court ought to be extremely careful and 
cautious in placing reliance thereupon.  There are a catena of decisions 
of this Court which lend support to the inter-play between provisions of 
the CrPC and the IEA, as explained above9. 
 
9   See:  i)  Mukeshbhai Gopalbhai Barot  v.  State of Gujarat, (2010) 12 SCC 224; (ii) Sri    
Bhagwan  v.  State of U.P., (2013) 12 SCC 137; (iii)  Pradeep Bisoi v. State of Odisha,  
(2019) 11 SCC 500. 

 
 
35
66. 
As regard to the assessment of mental fitness of the person 
making a dying declaration, it is indubitably the responsibility of the 
court to ensure that the declarant was in a sound state of mind. This is 
because there are no rigid procedures mandated for recording a dying 
declaration. If an eyewitness asserts that the deceased was conscious 
and capable of making the declaration, the medical opinion cannot 
override such affirmation, nor can the dying declaration be disregarded 
solely for want of a doctor's fitness certification. The requirement for a 
dying declaration to be recorded in the presence of a doctor, following 
certification of the declarant's mental fitness, is merely a matter of 
prudence.10  
67. 
The Constitution Bench in Laxman v.  State of Maharashtra11 
has authoritatively ruled that: 
“3. … …But where the eyewitnesses state that the 
deceased was in a fit and conscious state to make the 
declaration, the medical opinion will not prevail, nor can 
it be said that since there is no certification of the doctor 
as to the fitness of the mind of the declarant, the dying 
declaration is not acceptable.  A dying declaration can 
be oral or in writing and any adequate method of 
communication whether by words or by signs or 
otherwise will suffice provided the indication is positive 
and definite.  In most cases, however, such statements 
are made orally before death ensues and is reduced to 
writing by someone like a Magistrate or a doctor or a 
police officer. … … What is essentially required is that 
the person who records a dying declaration must be 
satisfied that the deceased was in a fit state of mind.  
Where it is proved by the testimony of the Magistrate 
 
10 Koli Chunilal Savji v. State of Gujarat, (1999) 9 SCC 562. 
 
11 (2002) 6 SCC 710 

 
 
36
that the declarant was fit to make the statement even 
without examination by the doctor the declaration can 
be acted upon provided the court ultimately holds the 
same to be voluntary and truthful.  A certification by 
the doctor is essentially a rule of caution and therefore 
the voluntary and truthful nature of the declaration can 
be established otherwise.” 
68. 
It is important in this case to appreciate that the Investigating 
Officer recorded the statement instantly, a day after the incident. He 
has categorically stated that the medical report did not mention that the 
condition of the declarant, Tularam, was serious in nature. More 
importantly, Tularam was able to convey his statement properly. 
Furthermore, on perusal of the statement, it is clear that the declarant 
Tularam was in a fit condition as not only did he properly explain the 
incident but has also markedly specified the role of the Appellant. That 
apart, the injuries found during the post-mortem examination 
conducted by P.W.13 and P.W.15 have duly corroborated the statement 
of deceased Tularam. 
69. 
From the above discussion, it is manifest that the mere non-
obtainment of a medical fitness certificate will not deter this Court from 
considering a properly recorded statement under Section 161 CrPC to 
be a dying declaration. 
 
CONCLUSION : 
70. 
For the reasons stated above, we are satisfied that there are no 
contradictions or discrepancies in the prosecution case of such a nature 

 
 
37
that would compel us to take a view different than that of the Trial Court 
and the High Court. We, therefore, do not find any merit in this appeal, 
which is, consequently, dismissed. If the Appellant is on bail, his bail 
bonds are cancelled, and he is directed to surrender and undergo the 
remainder of the sentence. However, if the Appellant is already in 
custody, in that event, he shall complete the remainder of the sentence. 
71. 
Ordered accordingly.
