The appellant (‘OP’/‘service provider’, used interchangeably) has 
challenged the order dated 10.03.2021 of the National Consumer Disputes 
Redressal Commission, New Delhi (NCDRC) in these appeals. The 
respondent (complainant) had successfully redressed its consumer 
grievance, originally, before the Principal Consumer Disputes Redressal for 
Bangalore Urban District, at Bangalore (‘District Forum’). The service 
provider was unsuccessful in upsetting the order of the District Forum before 
the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Bangalore (‘State 
Forum’) as well as the NCDRC. That is how this matter has come before us.

3. 
The service provider is a registered Chit Fund company engaged in 
Chit business. Admittedly, the complainant had subscribed to certain chits 
in the said business. The subscription was made in the chit group 
53005/Ticket No.9 for a chit value of Rs.1,00,000/- payable at the rate of 
Rs.2500/- per month for a period of 40 months.  
 
4. 
It is the case of the complainant that the OP had illegally stopped the 
chit business in the year 1996. The complainant requested the OP to repay 
the chit amount deposited until stoppage of the business. The OP refused to 
re-pay the subscription amount since, according to it, the complainant owed 
certain dues to it and therefore, it adjusted the subscription amount against 
pending dues of the complainant.  
 
5. 
Initially, the complainant sought to redress its grievance relating to 
non-refund of the subscription amount, before the authority constituted 
under the Chit Funds Act 1982.1 Thereafter, the OP filed WP No.22568/2012 
with 9 other connected writ petitions against the order of the Additional 
Registrar. Whereas the Complainant also filed WP No.17045/2014 with 9 
other connected writ petitions questioning the finding with regards to the 
 
1The complainant had filed 10 cases before the Assistant Registrar of Co-operative Societies i.e., Dispute 
No.1062/2004-05 to 1071/2004-05, for recovery of adjusted amount, whereunder the Assistant Registrar 
passed an award and directed the OP to pay the amount to complainant. Against the said order OP 
unsuccessfully challenged the orders in appeals before Additional Registrar of Co-operative Societies, 
Aliaskar Road, Bangalore, in appeal No.33/CAP/2009-10 to No.42/CAP/2009-10. The Additional 
Registrar directed the opposite party to pay the award amount on the ground that said chit groups did not 
come under the Chit Fund Act.

maintainability under the Chit Funds Act. On 16.11.2015, the High Court 
directed the complainant to approach the Consumer Forum and held that said 
cases were not maintainable under the Chit Funds Act. 
 
6. 
It is against this background that the complaint comes to be filed 
before the District Forum alleging that the illegal termination of the chit fund 
business and consequent non-refund of the subscription amount, resulted in 
deficiency of service. The prayer in the complaint was for a direction to be 
issued to the OP to refund Rs.18,750/- along with future interest at the rate 
of 18% p.a. 
 
7. 
In the written version, the OP, apart from contesting the claim on 
merits, raised a preliminary objection that the complaint is not maintainable 
since the complainant does not qualify the definition of a ‘consumer’. 
According to the OP, the service obtained by the complainant was for a 
commercial purpose, and by that fact, the complainant would stand excluded 
from availing any remedy under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. To 
demonstrate that the service was obtained for a commercial purpose, the OP 
relied on two circumstances: (a) the statement in the complainant that there 
was an ‘understanding between complainant and opposite party to promote 
chit business’; (b) findings2 of an internal audit conducted by the OP.  
 
2 As per the Internal Audit, the Complainant held 1023 prized chits, and 1043 non-prized chits. The report 
also mentions various correspondences between the complainant and OP with regards to the increasing 
disparity between the total liability of the fund, and the paid-up value of the non-prized chits. As per the

8. 
Against the said pleadings available on record, the District Forum 
proceeded to frame the following issue:  
I. Whether the Complainant has proved the alleged deficiency in 
service by the Opposite Party?  
II. If so, to what relief the Complainant is entitled? 
 
 
9. 
There was no specific issue framed on the preliminary question as 
to whether the complainant fell within the definition of consumer as 
understood under Section 2 (1) (d) of the Act of 1986. However, the District 
Forum did address itself, though incorrectly, to the objection of the OP that 
the complaint was not maintainable. Instead of examining whether the 
service availed on behalf of the complainant was for a commercial purpose, 
the District Forum determined whether the complainant fell within the 
definition of a “person” as defined in Section 2 (1)(m) of the Act. On merits, 
it found that there was, in fact, ‘deficiency in service’ and ordered for refund 
of the claimed amount with interest of 18% p.a. 
 
10. 
In appeal, the State Forum has cursorily found that the District 
Forum was correct in concluding that there was deficiency in service, on 
merits. Nothing has been said, however, as regards the challenge to the 
 
audit report, the balance liability amounted to Rs. 1.86 crores. It was stated that owing non-payment of 
outstanding arrears, the foreman in accordance with Section 28 and Section 29 of the Chit Fund Act is 
bound to remove the defaulted non-prized subscriber to keep the chit running, hence the defaulted non-
prized tickets maintained by Complainant were removed, and the paid amounts were adjusted against 
arrears in the prized chits.

maintainability of the complaint even though a specific ground was taken in 
the memorandum of appeal towards that end.  
 
11. 
The NCDRC has agreed with the State Forum and District Forum on 
the merits of the issue and found no reason to interfere with the ‘well 
appraised detailed order’ of the District Forum. It noted that there was no 
necessity to reappreciate the evidence de novo since the forums below had 
properly appreciated the issue in dispute. On the maintainability issue, the 
NCDRC appears to have mirrored the approach of the District Forum. 
Instead of examining whether the service obtained by the complainant was 
for a ‘commercial purpose’, it examined the question of whether the 
complainant falls within the definition of ‘person’.  Neither was such an 
objection raised by the OP in the version originally submitted before the 
District Forum nor was such a contention orally taken before the NCDRC. 
We fail to understand how the NCDRC failed to grasp the exact nature of 
the maintainability challenge. Be that as it may.  
 
12. 
It is against the above backdrop that we are called upon to determine 
the present lis. Instead of remanding the matter back to the Consumer Forum 
we intend to decide the maintainability challenge here itself. The question 
that has eluded three judicial forums has now to be settled once and for all. 
That question simply is: Whether the service obtained by the complainant 
was for a commercial purpose?

Section 2 (7) of the Act defines a consumer to mean:  
Section 2 (7) "consumer" means any person who—  
(i) buys any goods for a consideration which has been 
paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised, or under 
any system of deferred payment and includes any user of 
such goods other than the person who buys such goods for 
consideration paid or promised or partly paid or partly 
promised, or under any system of deferred payment, when 
such use is made with the approval of such person, but does 
not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for 
any commercial purpose; or  
(ii) hires or avails of any service for a consideration 
which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly 
promised, or under any system of deferred payment and 
includes any beneficiary of such service other than the 
person who hires or avails of the services for consideration 
paid or promised, or partly paid and partly promised, or 
under any system of deferred payment, when such services 
are availed of with the approval of the first mentioned 
person, but does not include a person who avails of such 
service for any commercial purpose.  
 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this clause,—  
(a) the expression "commercial purpose" does not 
include use by a person of goods bought and used by him 
exclusively for the purpose of earning his livelihood, by 
means of self-employment; 
 (b) the expressions "buys any goods" and "hires or 
avails any services" includes offline or online transactions 
through electronic means or by teleshopping or direct selling 
or multi-level marketing; 
 
 
14. 
 The provision as it stands now (as extracted above) was not how it 
appeared when it was grafted in the original Act. The definition of 
‘consumer’ has undergone textual amendments in 1993 and in 2002. For 
ease of reference, the evolutionary history of the provision from its origin 
until the 2019 Act is captured in the table below:

Structurally, there are three parts to the definition of a consumer. We 
can deconstruct Section 2(7)(i) as a matter of illustration.3 The first part sets 
out the jurisdictional prerequisites for a person to qualify as a consumer – 
there must be purchase of goods, for consideration4 . The second part is an 
‘exclusion clause’ [‘carve out’] which has the effect of excluding the person 
from the definition of a consumer. The carve out applies if the person has 
obtained goods for the purpose of ‘resale’ or for a ‘commercial purpose’. 
The third part is an exception to the exclusion clause – it relates to 
Explanation (a) to Section 2(7) which limits the scope of ‘commercial 
purpose’.  According to the said explanation, the expression, ‘commercial 
 
3 The logic can be identically extended to Section 2(7)(ii)  
4 The consideration may have been paid or partly paid or agreed to be paid in future. 

 
 
10 
 
purpose’ does not include persons who bought goods ‘exclusively for the 
purpose of earning his livelihood, by means of self-employment’. The 
significance of this structural break down will be discussed shortly. 
 
16. 
The carve out existed as part of the original enactment. However, the 
Explanation to Section 2(7) was inserted by amendment in 1993.  
 
17. 
Judicial experience has shown us that the service providers most 
often than not take up a plea in their written version that the service 
obtained/goods bought was for a commercial purpose. For, if they succeed 
in their plea, the complainant is excluded from availing any benefit under 
the Act. According to Section 11, the District Forum has jurisdiction to 
entertain complaints ‘where the value of the goods or services and the 
compensation, if any, claimed does not exceed rupees twenty lakhs’. The 
expression ‘complaint’ is defined in Section 2(1)(7)(c) to mean any 
allegation made in writing by a complainant relating to certain enumerated 
subjects. A complainant is defined 2(1)(b) to mean a consumer, among other 
entities. Therefore, to file a complaint, one must be a complainant and for 
one to be a complainant, he must be a consumer. If a person fails to come 
within the definition of a consumer, he cannot be a complainant5 and 
therefore, such person cannot file a complaint under the Act.  
 
5 Complainant is defined under Section 2 (1) (b) of the Act. A complainant means – (i) a consumer; or (ii) 
any voluntary consumer association registered under the Companies Act,1956 or under any other law for 

 
 
11 
 
 
18. 
In the facts of the instant case, the OP had raised a plea in its version 
that the complainant does not satisfy the definition of consumer since the 
service was obtained for a commercial purpose. Sri Shailesh Madiyal, 
learned Senior Advocate for the OP has argued vehemently that the 
complainant has not pleaded let alone prove that the services availed by it 
was for securing the livelihood of the complainant by means of self-
employment. According to Sri Shailesh Madiyal, the onus to prove that 
services were availed for earning livelihood rests on the complainant. In 
support of his submission, he has relied on Laxmi Engineering Works – 
(1995) 3 SCC 583; Leelavathi Kirtilal Medical Trust v. Unique Shanti 
Developers – (2020) 2 SCC 265; Cheema Engineering Services (1997) 1 
SCC 131 and; Paramount Digital Lab (2018) 14 SCC 81.  
 
19. 
Before we deal with the contention of Sri Shailesh Madiyal, it would 
be necessary to set out the manner in which consumer forums must decide 
technical pleas raised by service providers to the effect that the services 
obtained/goods bought was for a commercial purpose and, therefore, the 
complaint filed on behalf of such persons are not maintainable. The crucial 
step in deciding such pleas would turn on the manner in which the issues are 
framed.  Unless the burden of proof is properly cast on the relevant party, 
 
the time being in force; or (iii) the Central Government or any State Government, who or which makes a 
complaint. 

 
 
12 
 
the consumer forum would not be in a position to arrive at proper decision.  
Therefore, we proceed to provide some guidance on how the issues must be 
framed and the manner in which the evidence must be appreciated. 
 
20. 
 As we have shown above, the definition of consumer has three parts. 
The significance of deconstructing the definition into three parts was for the 
purpose of explaining on whom lies the onus to prove each of the different 
parts. There can hardly be any dispute that the onus of proving the first part 
i.e. that the person had bought goods/availed services for a consideration, 
rests on the complainant himself. The carve out clause, in the second part, is 
invoked by the service providers to exclude the complainants from availing 
benefits under the Act. The onus of proving that the person falls within the 
carve out must necessarily rest on the service provider and not the 
complainant. This is in sync with the general principle embodied in Section 
101 and 102 of the Evidence Act that ‘one who pleads must prove’. Since it 
is always the service provider who pleads that the service was obtained for 
a commercial purpose, the onus of proving the same would have to be borne 
by it. Further, it cannot be forgotten that the Consumer Protection Act is a 
consumer-friendly and beneficial legislation intended to address grievances 
of consumers.6 Moreover, a negative burden cannot be placed on the 
 
6 National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Harsolia Motors and Ors. (2023) 8 SCC 362. 

 
 
13 
 
complainant to show that the service available was not for a commercial 
purpose. 
 
21. 
 Having held that the onus to prove that the service was obtained for 
a commercial purpose is on the service provider, we may clarify the standard 
of proof that has to be met in order to discharge the onus. The standard of 
proof has to be measured against a ‘preponderance of probabilities’. The test 
to determine whether service obtained qualified as a commercial purpose is 
no longer res integra in view of this Court’s decision in Lilavathi v. Kiritlal 
(supra). Para 19 sets out the principles on which it must be determined 
whether the onus of proving ‘commercial purpose’ has been properly 
discharged by the service provider. 
 
22. 
If and only if, the service provider discharges its onus of showing 
that the service was availed, in fact for a commercial purpose, does the onus 
shift back to the complainant to bring its case within the third part, i.e. the 
Explanation (a) to Section 2(7) – to show that the service was obtained 
exclusively for the purpose of earning its livelihood by means of self-
employment. 
 
23. 
In this background, we must consider the plea of Sri Shailesh 
Madiyal that the complainant has not pleaded nor proved that the service 
was obtained for earning his livelihood through the means of self-

 
 
14 
 
employment. His argument relates to the third part of the definition of 
consumer. The question of inquiring into the third part will only arise if the 
service provider succeeds in crossing the second part by discharging its onus 
and proving that the service obtained was for a commercial purpose. Unless 
the service provider discharges its onus, the onus does not shift back to the 
complainant to show that the service obtained was exclusively for earning 
its livelihood through the means of self-employment. In the facts of this case, 
the OP has merely pleaded in its version that the service was obtained for a 
commercial purpose. No evidence has been led to probabilise its case other 
than merely restating its claim on affidavit. It is now well too settled that a 
plea without proof and proof without plea is no evidence in the eyes of law.  
 
24. 
We do not wish to address ourselves to the merits of the issue since 
three Forums have concurred in their finding that there was proved 
deficiency of service.  
 
25. 
Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals.
