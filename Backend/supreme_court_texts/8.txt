1. The rule of ‘Judicial Discipline and Propriety’ and 
the Doctrine of precedents has a merit of 
promoting certainty and consistency in judicial 
decisions providing assurance to individuals as 
to the consequences of their actions. The 
Constitution benches of this court have time and 
again reiterated the rules emerging from Judicial 
Discipline. Accordingly, when a decision of a 
coordinate Bench of same High court is brought 
to the notice of the bench, it is to be respected 
and is binding subject to right of the bench of 
such co-equal quorum to take a different view 
and refer the question to a larger bench. It is the

only course of action open to a bench of co-equal 
strength, when faced with the previous decision 
taken by a bench with same strength.  
 
2. The plaintiff is in appeal assailing the correctness 
of the judgment and order dated 21.07.2009 
passed by the Madurai Bench of Madras High 
Court, whereby, the Second Appeal filed by the 
defendant-respondent 
was 
allowed, 
the 
judgment and decree passed by the Sub-Judge, 
Padmanabhapuram dated 13.10.2003 was set 
aside and that of the Trial Court dated 
30.06.1997 was restored and confirmed.  
 
3. The 
appellant 
instituted 
a 
civil 
suit 
for 
declaration of title, possession and permanent 
injunction against the respondents which was 
registered as OS No. 308 of 1995 in the Court of 
District 
Munsiff-cum-Judicial 
Magistrate 
at 
Eraniel. The basis for filing the suit was that 
earlier in 1976, the respondents had filed a suit 
for ejectment of the appellant which was 
registered as OS No. 70 of 1976. The said suit 
was dismissed, First Appeal was dismissed and 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 3 of 16 
 
the Second Appeal was also dismissed by the 
High Court, vide judgment dated 30.03.1990. 
The same became final as it was not carried any 
further.  
 
4. The appellant continued in possession of the 
property in suit. However, as the respondents 
were trying to interfere with the possession of the 
appellant, she filed the suit.  
 
5. The respondents contested the suit and filed 
their written statements. According to them, the 
defence taken was that they had purchased 8 
cents of land by way of registered sale deed on 
13.03.1974 which was with respect to an open 
piece of land and did not contain any building as 
such. The suit of 1976 filed by them was with 
respect to the constructions raised by the 
appellant and not with respect to 8 cents of land. 
The appellant had no right, title or interest over 
the suit property. The suit was liable to be 
dismissed.  
 
6. The Trial Court framed the following six issues: 
 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 4 of 16 
 
 
 
(i). 
Whether 
the 
suit 
property 
properly 
absolutely belongs to the plaintiffs? 
(ii). Whether the decision of the Honourable High 
Court of Madras in S.A. No. 2082/1990 
relates to the entire 8 cents of the suit 
property or whether it pertains to the house 
in a portion of the suit property? 
(iii). Whether 
the 
plaintiffs 
have 
been 
in 
possession and enjoyment of the entire suit 
property? 
(iv). Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the 
relief of permanent injunction as prayed for? 
(v). Whether 
the 
suit 
property 
is 
to 
be 
demarcated and northern boundary is put 
up as prayed for? 
(vi). What reliefs are the Plaintiffs entitled to? 
 
7. Issue No. 2 related to the question whether the 
judgment of the High Court in Second Appeal No. 
2082 of 1990 related to the entire 8 cents of the 
property or whether it pertained only to the 
house in a portion of the land in dispute. 
 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 5 of 16 
 
8. The 
Trial 
Court, 
vide 
judgement 
dated 
30.06.1997, decreed the suit for declaration of 
title, possession and permanent injunction but 
only with respect to the portion over which the 
house property was situated out of the total 
extent of 8 cents of the suit property. With 
respect to the other property, the suit was 
dismissed.  
 
9. Aggrieved by the dismissal of the suit, the 
appellant preferred an Appeal which was 
registered as Appeal No. 169 of 1997. The Sub-
Judge vide judgement dated 13.10.2003 modified 
the judgement and decree of the Trial Court and 
declared that the appellants were entitled for the 
entire suit property for relief of declaration of 
title, permanent injunction and for setting up 
their boundary for securing the said property. 
The learned Sub-Judge had mainly relied upon 
the judgment of the High Court dated 30.03.1990 
in the earlier round of litigation.  
 
10. Aggrieved by the judgment of the Sub-Judge, the 
respondents preferred second appeal before the 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 6 of 16 
 
High Court registered as Second Appeal No. 451 
of 2004. The High Court, by the impugned 
judgment dated 21.07.2009, allowed the appeal, 
set aside the judgment of the Sub-Judge and 
restored the decree of the Trial Court. Aggrieved 
by the same, the plaintiff has preferred the 
present appeal. 
 
11. Heard learned counsel for the parties and 
perused the material on record. 
 
12. The main argument advanced on behalf of the 
appellant is that the High Court in the first round 
in its judgment dated 30.03.1990 had specifically 
recorded that the dispute was with respect to 8 
cents of land and the construction standing 
thereon. The Trial Court or the High Court 
therefore in the present round of litigation could 
not have confined it only to the construction and 
not the entire portion of land measuring 8 cents. 
It is further submitted that under the law of 
merger, the judgment of the Trial Court and the 
First Appeal Court in the first round of litigation 
merged with the judgment of the High Court 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 7 of 16 
 
dated 30.03.1990 and it is that judgment alone 
which has to be read as final and binding 
between the parties. It is also submitted that the 
First Appeal Court in its judgement dated 
13.10.2003 in the present round had specifically 
recorded that the Trial Court had no jurisdiction 
to go against the judgement of the High Court. 
The High Court in its impugned judgement has 
in fact breached the judicial discipline by taking 
a view contrary to the earlier judgement. 
 
13. On the other hand, learned Counsel for the 
respondents submitted that the judgements of 
the Trial Court and the High Court in the present 
round is correct in law and facts. The earlier 
round of litigation initiated by the respondents 
was only with respect to the constructions raised 
by the appellant which of course they had lost. 
The respondents had throughout been in 
possession of the 8 cents of land. The appellants 
were never in possession thereof. The judgement 
of the Trial Court and that of the High Court 
deserves to be maintained.  
 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 8 of 16 
 
14. In the judgement of the High Court in the first 
round dated 30.03.1990, it is not at one place but 
at number of places that the High Court has 
recorded that the suit property comprised of 8 
cents of land which was the land purchased by 
the respondents in 1974. It would be relevant to 
refer to such facts noted in the said judgment. In 
the opening paragraph the High Court mentioned 
as follows: 
 
“The suit property is consisting of 8 cents. 
The defendant was residing in this 
property even prior to the purchase of this 
property by the plaintiff.” 
 
Then again in paragraph no.2, the High Court 
records as follows:  
 
“The learned counsel appearing for the 
appellant contended that the suit property 
is comprised of 8 cents of land and the 
appellant purchased the same by a sale 
deed dated 13.03.1974, which is marked 
as Exhibit A-1”.  
 
The above clearly shows that not only the High Court 
notes that it was 8 cents of land which was in dispute 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 9 of 16 
 
but also the Counsel for the appellants therein 
(respondents 
herein) 
whose 
submissions 
are 
recorded understood it in the same manner. Again, in 
paragraph no.3, the High Court records as follows: 
 
“In the sale deed dated 13.03.1974 (Exhibit 
A1) there is no mention about the 
superstructure in which the respondent 
herein is residing. The sale deed merely 
states about the sale of 8 cents of land. As 
already stated, that the respondent was 
residing in the suit property even prior to 
the purchase by the appellant.”  
 
Lastly, the High Court records its finding as follows: 
 
“The courts below found that all the 
documents produced by the respondent 
herein are in the name of the respondent. 
Therefore, 
considering 
all 
these 
documents, the courts below came to the 
conclusion that the respondent herein is in 
possession of the suit property for more 
than the statutory period and so she had 
perfected her title by adverse possession.” 
 
15. In the light of the above facts, arguments and 
findings recorded by the High Court in its 
judgment dated 30.031990, apparently no 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 10 of 16 
 
defence was left for the respondents to take as it 
was already held that the appellant had perfected 
her rights by adverse possession over the suit 
property which was 8 cents of land. The 
construction of the appellant was standing over 
the 8 cents of land may be on part of it but she 
was found in possession of the entire 8 cents. 
 
16.  The respondents never sought any clarification 
of the findings of the High Court or the 
observations made therein nor did they assail the 
same before any higher forum. The judgement 
dated 30.03.1990 attained finality. Interpreting 
the said judgement which was clear in itself any 
differently would clearly amount to judicial 
indiscipline. The Sub-Judge in its judgement 
dated 13.10.2003 had rightly observed that the 
Trial Court had no business to interpret the 
judgement of the High Court dated 30.03.1990 in 
any other way than what was recorded therein.  
 
17. The doctrine of merger is a common law doctrine 
that is rooted in the idea of maintenance of the 
decorum of hierarchy of courts and tribunals. 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 11 of 16 
 
The doctrine is based on the simple reasoning 
that there cannot be, at the same time, more than 
one operative order governing the same subject 
matter. The same was aptly summed up by this 
Court when it described the said doctrine in 
Kunhayammed & Ors. v. State of Kerala & 
Anr.1: 
“44 (i) Where an appeal or revision is 
provided against an order passed by a 
court, tribunal or any other authority 
before superior forum and such superior 
forum modifies, reverses or affirms the 
decision put in issue before it, the decision 
by the subordinate forum merges in the 
decision by the superior forum and it is the 
latter which subsists, remains operative 
and is capable of enforcement in the eye of 
the Law.” 
 
18. The legal position on Coordinate Benches has 
further been elaborated by this Court in State of 
Punjab & Anr. v. Devans Modern Breweries 
Ltd. & Anr.2: 
“339. Judicial discipline envisages that a 
coordinate Bench follow the decision of an 
earlier coordinate Bench. If a coordinate 
Bench does not agree with the principles of 
law enunciated by another Bench, the 
 
1 (2000) 6 SCC 359 
2  (2004) 11 SCC 26 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 12 of 16 
 
matter may be referred only to a larger 
Bench.  
 
340. In Halsbury's Laws of England (4th 
Edn.), Vol. 26 at pp. 297-98, para 578, it 
is stated: “A decision is given per incuriam 
when the court has acted in ignorance of a 
previous decision of its own or of a court of 
coordinate jurisdiction which covered the 
case before it, in which case it must decide 
which case to follow.” 
 
19. We have already discussed about the importance 
of ensuring judicial discipline and the same has 
also been upheld by various judgement of this 
Court. In Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra 
Community & Anr. vs. State of Maharashtra & 
Anr.3, this Court has summed up the legal 
position of rules of judicial discipline as follows: 
“12.  
 
 
 
*** 
(1) The law laid down by this Court in a 
decision delivered by a Bench of larger 
strength is binding on any subsequent 
Bench of lesser or coequal strength.  
 
(2) A Bench of lesser quorum cannot 
disagree or dissent from the view of the law 
taken by a Bench of larger quorum. In case 
of doubt all that the Bench of lesser 
quorum can do is to invite the attention of 
the Chief Justice and request for the 
 
3 (2005) 2 SCC 673 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 13 of 16 
 
matter being placed for hearing before a 
Bench of larger quorum than the Bench 
whose 
decision 
has 
come 
up 
for 
consideration. It will be open only for a 
Bench of coequal strength to express an 
opinion doubting the correctness of the 
view taken by the earlier Bench of coequal 
strength, whereupon the matter may be 
placed 
for 
hearing 
before 
a 
Bench 
consisting of a quorum larger than the one 
which pronounced the decision laying 
down the law the correctness of which is 
doubted.” 
 
 
20. In the current case, as previously mentioned, the 
High Court's judgment from the initial round 
dated 30.03.1990, noted that the disputed 
property included 8 cents of land, not just the 
building structure on it. As per the Doctrine of 
Merger, the judgments of the Trial Court and the 
First Appellate Court from the first round of 
litigation are absorbed into the High Court's 
judgment dated 30.03.1990. This 1990 judgment 
should be regarded as the conclusive and binding 
order from the initial litigation. Following the 
principles 
of 
judicial 
discipline, 
lower 
or 
subordinate Courts do not have the authority to 
contradict the decisions of higher Courts. In the 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 14 of 16 
 
current case, the Trial Court and the High Court, 
in the second round of litigation, violated this 
judicial discipline by adopting a position contrary 
to the High Court's final judgment dated 
30.03.1990, from the first round of litigation. 
 
21. The argument of the Counsel for respondents is 
mainly that the judgment of the Trial Court and 
First Appellate Court in the first round of 
litigation clearly stated in the case of the plaintiff 
that it was with respect to the constructed 
portion only in which the mother of the appellant 
was residing and not the whole area of 8 cents 
purchased by them. The High Court committed a 
bona fide error in recording that the suit property 
was 8 cents along with constructions standing 
over it. As such the Trial Court and the High 
Court in the present round were correct in 
limiting the decree only to the constructions and 
not the entire area of 8 cents. 
 
22. In order to test the above agreement, we carefully 
examined the judgement of the Trial Court as 
also 
the 
First 
Appellate 
Court. 
What 
is 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 15 of 16 
 
discernible is that nowhere it is recorded the 
actual boundary or the measurements of the 
property in possession of the mother of the 
appellant (defendant therein). The respondents-
plaintiff therein had based her case on the 
ground that they had purchased 8 cents of open 
piece of land and the defendant therein had 
raised construction over some adjoining land, 
and had trespassed over part of her purchased 
land as such decree of possession be granted. 
 
23. We are unable to appreciate the said argument of 
the respondents. Suit for possession has to 
describe the property in question with accuracy 
and all details of measurement and boundaries. 
This 
was 
completely 
lacking. 
A 
suit 
for 
possession with respect to such a property would 
be liable to be dismissed on the ground of its 
identifiability. Further, it may be noted that if the 
construction by the defendant were not made 
over 8 cents of purchased land, then the plaintiff 
therein would not have a claim to possession of 
the same. The argument thus has to be rejected 

Civil Appeal No. 9941 of 2016 
 
Page 16 of 16 
 
not only on facts but also on legal grounds as 
discussed above. 
 
24. The 
appeal 
is, 
accordingly, 
allowed. 
The 
impugned judgment and order of the High Court 
is set aside and that of the First Appellate Court 
dated 13.10.2003 passed by the Sub-Judge, 
Padmanabhapuram is restored and maintained. 
 
25. There shall be no order as to costs.
