FACTS 
 
1. 
The appellant filed a complaint under Section 200 of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, alleging the 
commission of an offence of violating the provisions in 
Section 29A of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987 (for 
short, the ‘1987 Act’). The learned Magistrate took 
cognizance of the complaint for the offence under Section 
29A (i) read with Section 50 and punishable under Section 
49 (2A) of the 1987 Act.  Section 49(2A) provides for a 
minimum sentence of one year, which may extend to five 
years. For convenience, we will refer to the parties as per

their status before the Trial Court. The first accused is a 
company. The second accused was described in the 
complaint as the Managing Director of the first accused 
company, and the other five accused were described as the 
Directors. By the impugned judgment, the High Court has 
proceeded to quash the complaint in its entirety. The High 
Court held that the requirements of sub-Section (1) of 
Section 50 of the 1987 Act are similar to the requirements 
incorporated in Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments 
Act, 1881 (for short, ‘the NI Act’), which were not complied 
with by the complainant. 
 
SUBMISSIONS 
2. 
The learned counsel appearing for the appellant has 
taken us through the averments made in the complaint 
and the provisions of the said Act of 1987. He submitted 
that on a plain reading of the complaint, a violation of the 
provisions in Section 29A (i) of the 1987 Act was made out. 
Therefore, there was no reason to quash the complaint. 
Inviting our attention to the complaint, he pointed out that 
the second accused was described as the Managing 
Director of the first respondent and, therefore, he was in 
charge of and was responsible to the first respondent 
company for the conduct of the company's business. He 
submitted that there were sufficient averments for 
implicating the other accused.

3. 
The learned counsel appearing for the accused 
supported the impugned judgment and submitted that 
averments as required by sub-Section (1) of Section 50 of 
the 1987 Act have not been incorporated in the complaint.  
REASONS 
4. 
Section 50 of the 1987 Act reads thus: 
“50. 
Offences 
by 
Companies.—(1) 
Where 
an 
offence 
has 
been 
committed by a company, every 
person who, at the time the offence 
was committed, was in charge of, and 
was responsible to, the company for 
the conduct of the business of the 
company, as well as the company, 
shall be deemed to be guilty of the 
offence and shall be liable to be 
proceeded 
against 
and 
punished 
accordingly: 
 
Provided that nothing contained in this 
sub-section shall render any such 
person 
liable 
to 
any 
punishment 
provided in this Act, if he proves that the 
offence was committed without his 
knowledge or that he had exercised all 
due diligence to prevent the commission 
of such offence. 
 
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained 
in sub-section (1), where an offence 
under this Act has been committed by a 
company and it is proved that the 

 
 
            Criminal Appeal @ SLP(Crl.) 452-53 of 2018 
 
Page 4 of 9 
 
offence has been committed with the 
consent 
or 
connivance 
of, 
or 
is 
attributable to any neglect on the part 
of any director, manager, secretary or 
other officer of the company, such 
director, manager, secretary or other 
officer shall also be deemed to be guilty 
of that offence and shall be liable to be 
proceeded 
against 
and 
punished 
accordingly. 
 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this 
section— 
(a) 
“company” 
means 
any 
body 
corporate and includes a firm or other 
association of individuals; and 
(b) “director”, in relation to a firm, 
means a partner in the firm.” 
  
 
 
(emphasis added) 
 
There is no dispute that sub-Section (1) of Section 50 is 
pari materia with Section 141 of the NI Act.  
5. 
Paragraph 9 of the complaint contains relevant 
averments on which reliance was placed by the learned 
counsel for the complainant. Paragraph 9 reads thus: 
“The complainant submits that the 
Accused No. 1 herein is a Limited 
Company, having its registered Office at 
Nos. 73/1A, Jermiah Road, Vepery, 
Chennai-600007. It was incorporated 
on 17-12-1996 as a Limited Company 
under the Companies Act, 1956 and 
obtained Certificate for commencement

of Business on 22.01.1997 from the 
Additional 
registrar 
of 
Companies, 
Tamilnadu. The Xerox Copy of the 
Memorandum 
and 
Articles 
of 
Association of the Accused Company is 
filed herewith. Accused No. 2 is the 
Managing Director and the Accused 3 to 
7 are the Directors of the First Accused 
Company and they are conducting the 
business of the company and are 
associated with the common aspect of 
their said business and are also 
responsible for the Management of the 
First Accused Company. They are also 
looking after the day today affairs of the 
First Accused Company and they are 
jointly and severally responsible for the 
conduct or for omission regarding the 
conduct of the business of the First 
Accused Company.”  
6. 
Hence, there were no assertions made that the 
second to seventh accused, at the time of the commission 
of the offence, were in charge of, and responsible to the 
first accused company for the conduct of its business. 
Unless assertions, as required by sub-Section (1) of 
Section 50, are made, vicarious liability of the Directors of 
the first accused company is not attracted.  
7. 
A Bench of three Hon’ble Judges of this Court had 
an occasion to interpret Section 141 of NI Act in the case 
of S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Neeta Bhalla and

Anr.1 In Paragraph 1, the points for determination were 
framed which read thus: 
“This matter arises from a reference 
made by a two-Judge Bench of this 
Court for determination of the following 
questions by a larger Bench: 
 “(a) Whether for purposes of Section 
141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 
1881, it is sufficient if the substance of 
the allegation read as a whole fulfil the 
requirements of the said section and it 
is not necessary to specifically state in 
the complaint that the person accused 
was in charge of, or responsible for, the 
conduct of the business of the company. 
 (b) Whether a director of a company 
would be deemed to be in charge of, and 
responsible to, the company for conduct 
of the business of the company and, 
therefore, deemed to be guilty of the 
offence unless he proves to the contrary. 
 (c) Even if it is held that specific 
averments are necessary, whether in 
the absence of such averments the 
signatory of the cheque and or the 
managing directors or joint managing 
director who admittedly would be in 
charge of the company and responsible

to the company for conduct of its 
business could be proceeded against.” 
The conclusions are in paragraph 19, which reads thus: 
“19. In view of the above discussion, 
our answers to the questions posed in 
the reference are as under: 
(a) 
 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
specifically aver in a complaint under 
Section 141 that at the time the 
offence was committed, the person 
accused was in charge of, and 
responsible 
for 
the 
conduct 
of 
business 
of 
the 
company. 
This 
averment is an essential requirement 
of Section 141 and has to be made in 
a complaint. Without this averment 
being made in a complaint, the 
requirements of Section 141 cannot 
be said to be satisfied. 
(b) 
 
The answer to the question 
posed in sub-para (b) has to be in the 
negative. Merely being a director of a 
company is not sufficient to make the 
person liable under Section 141 of the 
Act. A director in a company cannot be 
deemed to be in charge of and 
responsible to the company for the 
conduct 
of 
its 
business. 
The 
requirement of Section 141 is that the 
person sought to be made liable should 
be in charge of and responsible for the 
conduct of the business of the company 
at the relevant time. This has to be 
averred as a fact as there is no deemed 
liability of a director in such cases. 

 
 
            Criminal Appeal @ SLP(Crl.) 452-53 of 2018 
 
Page 8 of 9 
 
(c) 
 
The answer to Question (c) 
has to be in the affirmative. The 
question notes that the managing 
director or joint managing director 
would be admittedly in charge of the 
company and responsible to the 
company for the conduct of its 
business. When that is so, holders of 
such positions in a company become 
liable under Section 141 of the Act. 
By virtue of the office they hold as 
managing director or joint managing 
director, these persons are in charge 
of and responsible for the conduct of 
business of the company. Therefore, 
they get covered under Section 141. 
So far as the signatory of a cheque 
which is dishonoured is concerned, 
he is clearly responsible for the 
incriminating act and will be covered 
under sub-section (2) of Section 141.” 
  
 
 
 
(emphasis added) 
8. 
Hence, in the absence of the averments as 
contemplated by sub-section (1) of Section 50 of the 1984 
Act in the complaint, the Trial Court could not have taken 
cognizance of the offence against the third to seventh 
accused, who are allegedly the directors of the first 
accused company. However, the second accused being the 
Managing Director, would be in charge of the company 
and responsible to the company for its business. 
Therefore, there was no justification for quashing the 
complaint against the second accused. The first 

 
 
            Criminal Appeal @ SLP(Crl.) 452-53 of 2018

respondent is a company. No reasons have been assigned 
to quash the complaint against the first accused. 
9. 
Hence, the appeals partly succeed, and we pass the 
following order: 
(a)  The impugned order is modified, and it is directed 
that complaint C.C. No. 4331 of 2010 filed in the 
Court of the Judicial Magistrate, Egmore at 
Chennai shall stand quashed as against the third 
to seventh accused shown therein. However, the 
complaint shall proceed according to the law 
against the first and second accused.  
(b) The Appeals are partly allowed on the above 
terms.
