CIVIL APPEAL NOS.2399-2401/2023
1.
The appellants are the defendants in a suit filed by the first
respondent and one Shanti Devi, who is no more and has been shown
as the third respondent in these Appeals.  For convenience, we are
referring  to  the  parties  with  reference  to  their  status  in  the
suit. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.
  
2.
The suit was filed on 8th November, 2001 for possession of the
property,  more  particularly  described  in  the  schedule  (suit
property).  The allegation in the suit is that the first defendant,
the State of Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand), was a tenant of the

plaintiffs in respect of the suit property at a monthly rent of
Rs.86,232/-  (Rupees  Eighty-six  Thousand  Two  Hundred  and  Thirty-
two), which was fixed by an order dated 18th May, 1999 passed by the
learned 3rd Additional District Judge, Dehradun.  The allegation is
that though the rent was fixed with effect from 1st September, 1993,
the  first  defendant  did  not  pay  the  rent.   Therefore,  the
plaintiffs issued a notice of termination of tenancy under Section
106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. As the defendants failed
to comply with the said notice, the suit for eviction was filed.
3.
It appears from the record of the Trial Court that after the
service of summons on the defendants, they appeared and applied for
adjournments  for  filing  the  written  statement.   The  first  such
application  was  made  on  13th  December  2001.  
 Subsequent
applications were made for adjournments. On 22nd April 2002, the
learned  trial  Judge  did  not  accede  to  the  prayer  for  grant  of
further time and passed an order that the suit would proceed  ex
parte and a date for  ex parte hearing, i.e., 30th May 2002, was
fixed.  At this stage, we may also note that the plaintiffs also
made an application to strike out the defence of the defendants.
The said application was filed on 18th February 2002. On the said
application, the Advocate for the plaintiffs made an endorsement in
the  margin  that  as  there  was  no  advocate  representing  the
defendants,  a  copy  of  the  application  was  attached  to  the
application.  Though the date for the ex parte hearing was already
fixed as 30th May 2002, on 3rd May 2002, the plaintiffs made an
application  to  the  Trial  Court  for  passing  an  order  on  the
2

application  dated  18th  February  2002  for  striking  out  the
defendants' defence. Interestingly, on the same day, the plaintiffs
moved  another  application  stating  that  the  plaintiffs  may  be
permitted to lead their ex parte evidence through affidavits.  It
appears  that  on  3rd May,  2002,  the  Trial  Court  allowed  the
application  for  striking  out  the  defence.   Subsequent  facts
narrated in this judgment would show that the suit was taken on the
cause list on that day without any notice to the defendants. 
 
4.
On 16th May, 2002, an application was moved by the defendants
for  setting  aside  the  order  dated  22nd April,  2002.   In  the
application, the averments were made that on 22nd April, 2002, the
District Judge before whom the suit was pending, was holding a Camp
Court at Mussoorie.  We may note that the suit was pending in the
Court at Dehradun.  The contention in the said application was that
as the learned District Judge was unavailable, the defendants were
under the impression that the suit would not proceed.  In fact, in
the  affidavit  filed  in  support  of  the  said  application  by  one
Mukesh  Kumar  Malik  on  behalf  of  the  Superintendent  of  Police,
Dehradun, it is stated that he was present on 22nd April 2002 till
4:00 p.m., but the case was not called out.  On 30th May, 2002, the
application  for  setting  aside  the  order  directing  the  suit  to
proceed  ex parte was rejected.  At this stage, we may note here
that in the proceedings of 22nd April 2002, it was recorded that on
that day, the lawyers had abstained from the Court work, and the
learned Presiding Judge was on a tour of Mussoorie for holding a
camp.  There is no mention in the proceedings of 22nd April, 2002
3

that any in charge Judicial Officer passed an order to proceed with
the  suit  ex  parte.   To  the  specific  allegations  made  by  the
defendants in the application for setting aside the ex parte order
that the Judicial Officer was not available, in the reply filed by
the  plaintiffs  in  paragraph  4,  all  that  is  stated  is  that  the
contentions that on 22nd April, 2002, the learned District Judge had
proceeded to Mussoorie, are misconceived and the provisions of the
Assam and Agra Civil Courts Act are apparent in this respect.  
5.
On 1st July, 2002, the defendants applied for setting aside the
order dated 3rd May, 2002 by which their defence was struck out. The
application proceeds on the allegation that on 3rd May, 2002, the
Court  proceeded  to  strike  out  the  defendants'  defence  without
giving  them  an  opportunity  of  being  heard  and  the  hearing  was
conducted ex parte.  Very interestingly, a reply was filed to the
said application by the plaintiffs in which a stand has been taken
that as the suit was directed to proceed  ex parte, there was no
occasion to give an intimation to the defendants or their counsel
that the application will be taken up on 3rd May, 2002.  Therefore,
it is an accepted position that the application for striking out
the defence of the defendants was taken up on the cause list on
3rd May 2002 without issuing notice to the defendants, though on
22nd April, 2002, the next date was already fixed as 30th May 2002.
The application for setting aside the order dated 3rd May, 2002 was
rejected.  At this stage, we must clarify the legal position.  Even
if a defendant does not file a written statement and the suit is
ordered  to  proceed  ex  parte  against  him,  the  limited  defence
4

available  to  the  defendant  is  not  foreclosed.   A  defendant  can
always  cross-examine  the  witnesses  examined  by  the  plaintiff  to
prove the falsity of the plaintiff's case. A defendant can always
urge, based on the plaint and the evidence of the plaintiff, that
the suit was barred by a statute such as the law of limitation.
Therefore, notwithstanding an order passed earlier to proceed  ex
parte, while deciding an application for striking out the defence,
it was the duty of the Court to give an opportunity of being heard
to the defendants.  However, that was not done.   As the suit was
fixed on 30th May, 2002, the defendants were entitled to a notice
that the suit would be taken up on an earlier date for hearing the
application for striking out the defence. When the defendants had
appeared in the suit, the act of preponing the date without notice
to them or their advocate was completely illegal and contrary to
elementary  principles  of  natural  justice.  Therefore,  it  follows
that the order striking out the defendants' defence is completely
illegal, and the said order deserves to be set aside.  
6.
There is something further which must be noted.  As can be
seen from the record, the plaintiffs moved an application on 2nd
August, 2002 to amend the description of the suit property.  The
endorsement on the application records that ‘the case is proceeding
ex parte against the defendants’. Therefore, a copy of the said
application was not served upon the defendants.  As seen from the
proceedings,  the  application  was  allowed  on  2nd August,  2002.
Thereafter, the suit was decreed on 24th August, 2002.  It is true
that  before  the  application  for  amendment  of  the  plaint  was
5

allowed, the defendants' defence was already struck out.  Even if
the  defendants'  defence  was  struck  out,  the  defendants  were
entitled to a copy of the amended plaint. What was struck out was
the right to defend the suit as unamended.  Whether the subsequent
plaint will affect the earlier order of striking out the defence
will depend upon the nature of the amendment.  However, even a copy
of the amended plaint was not served on the defendants. 
 
7.
The  defendants  challenged  the  ex  parte  decree  by  filing  a
statutory revision application under Section 25 of the Provincial
Small Cause Courts Act, 1887, before the learned Single Judge of
the High Court.  By the impugned judgment, the learned Single Judge
rejected the said revision application without noticing the glaring
facts borne out from the record which we have reproduced above.  A
review of the said order of the learned Single Judge was sought.
However, the same was dismissed on 4th January, 2011. However, the
defendants did not challenge the decree or the order passed on the
revision application or review for three years.  Instead, they were
advised to raise objections under Section 47 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 in the execution proceedings. 
8.
The  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the  plaintiffs
submitted that the defendants' conduct needs to be deprecated.  The
revenue entries were illegally altered to enable them to raise a
contention  regarding  the  lack  of  title  on  the  part  of  the
plaintiffs.  Even the State Government prosecuted the plaintiffs.
6

9.
Now,  the  clear  picture  which  emerges  is  that  the  suit  was
decreed  ex  parte without  giving  proper  opportunity  to  the
defendants to defend themselves.  On 22nd April 2002, when the order
directing that the suit would proceed ex parte was passed, the date
fixed for ex parte hearing was 30th May 2002.  On that date, the
defendants could have appeared and applied for setting aside the
said order.  The Court could have always favourably considered that
application  by  putting  the  defendants  to  conditions.   However,
without waiting till 30th May, 2002, on 3rd May 2002, without issuing
notice to the defendants, the suit was taken up by the Trial Court,
and an order of striking out the defendants' defence was passed,
obviously,  without  hearing  the  defendants.  
 Therefore,  an
illegality  has  been  associated  with  the  conduct  of  the  suit
proceedings and the manner in which the ex parte decree was passed.
Consequently, we propose to set aside the orders dated 22nd April,
2002 and 3rd May, 2002 and relegate the suit to that stage.
10.
There is another aspect of the matter.  On 18th May 1999, the
3rd  Additional  District  Judge,  Dehradun,  passed  an  order  in  an
Appeal directing the defendants to pay rent at Rs.86,232/ (Rupees
Eighty-six Thousand Two Hundred and Thirty-two) per month.  The
High  Court  and  this  Court  confirmed  the  said  order.   The
defendants'  liability  under  the  said  order  was  to  pay  rent  at
Rs.86,232/-  per  month  from  1st September,  1993.   The  learned
Attorney  General  for  India,  on  instructions  of  the  State
Government,  states  that  the  rent  at  the  said  rate  has  been
deposited up to date.  We take the statement on record.
7

11.
Much water has flown after the rent was fixed at the rate of
Rs.86,232/- per month on 18th May, 1999.  The fact remains that the
proceedings were delayed due to some default on the part of the
defendants.  Therefore, as a condition for setting aside the ex
parte decree, we propose to direct the State Government to pay an
ad hoc amount at the rate of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh) per
month from 14th July, 2014 and continue to pay the said amount till
the  disposal  of  the  suit.   The  deposit  will  be  subject  to  the
outcome  of  the  suit.   The  defendants  will  be  entitled  to  an
adjustment of the amounts they paid at the rate of Rs.86,232/- per
month.  We propose to grant two months to the defendants to pay the
balance amount payable up to date at the rate of Rs.1,00,000/- per
month from 14th July, 2014.
12.
Hence, we set aside the impugned orders and partly allow the
Appeals with the following directions:
(i)
   The ex parte decree dated 24th August, 2002 passed by
the learned District and Session Judge, Dehradun, in SCC Suit
No.24/2001 is hereby set aside. The suit is restored to the
file  of  the  learned  District  and  Session  Judge,  Dehradun,
subject  to  the  condition  of  the  appellants/defendants
depositing  an  ad  hoc  amount  at  the  rate  of  Rs.1,00,000/-
(Rupees One Lakh) per month from 14th July, 2014 with the Trial
Court  within  a  period  of  two  months  from  today.  As  stated
earlier,  the  appellants/defendants  will  be  entitled  to  an
adjustment  of  Rs.86,232/-  (Rupees  Eighty-six  Thousand  Two
8

Hundred and Thirty-two) per month deposited by them for the
said period.  We make it clear that on the failure of the
appellants/defendants  to  deposit  the  said  amount  within  the
stipulated period, the ex parte decree shall stand revived;
(ii)    If the direction mentioned above is complied with,
even the orders dated 22nd April, 2002 and 3rd May, 2002 will
stand set aside; 
(iii)
The defendants shall continue to deposit the amount
at the rate of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh) per month till
the disposal of the suit;
(iv)  
In  the  event  the  compliance  is  made  by  the
appellants/defendants, we direct that the restored suit shall
be  listed  before  the  learned  District  and  Session  Judge,
Dehradun in the morning on 25th November, 2024.  We make it
clear that the defendants and the plaintiffs shall be under an
obligation to appear before the Court of the learned District
and  Session  Judge,  Dehradun,  on  that  day,  and  no  further
notice shall be served upon them.  We clarify that on the date
of appearance, the appellants/defendants shall file a reply to
the application for striking out the defence, and no further
time  shall  be  granted  to  them  for  that  purpose.  If  the
appellants/defendants fail to file a reply to the application
for striking out their defence on that day, the Trial Court
will be justified in proceeding with the hearing of the said
application without the reply of the appellants/defendants;
9

(v)
Only after deciding the application for striking out the
defence, depending upon the outcome of the said application,
the  Trial  Court  will  pass  orders  regarding  permitting  the
appellants/defendants to file written statement;
(vi)    The amounts deposited in this Court at the rate of
Rs.86,232/-  (Rupees  Eighty-six  Thousand  Two  Hundred  and
Thirty-two) per month with accrued interest thereon shall be
transferred by the Registry of this Court to the Trial Court
at Dehradun after expiry of the present fixed deposit.  We
direct  the  Trial  Court  to  invest  the  amount  which  may  be
deposited  by  the  appellants/defendants  in  terms  of  this
judgment and the amount which will transferred by the Registry
of this Court to the Trial Court in a fixed deposit with any
nationalised bank; 
(vii)
After the application for striking out the defence
is decided, it will be open for the plaintiffs to apply for
withdrawal of the amounts.  The Trial Court shall decide the
said application on its own merits.  All contentions on that
behalf are left open;
(viii)
We make it clear that we have made no adjudication
on the merits of the controversy, including the title issue
raised by the appellants/defendants.  The Trial Court shall
pass  appropriate  orders  in  accordance  with  the  law  in  the
restored suit on its own merits;
10

(ix) We  make  it  clear  that  as  we  have  directed  the
appellants/defendants to deposit the ad hoc amount at the rate
of  Rs.1,00,000/-  (Rupees  One  Lakh)  per  month,  we  are  not
passing a separate order of costs;
(x)
 Considering the fact that the suit is of the year 2001,
it is obvious that the Trial Court will give necessary out of
turn priority for hearing the application for striking out the
defence.  In the event the suit is required to be heard on
merits, the Trial Court will give the necessary priority to
the disposal of the suit, considering the fact that the suit
is of the year 2001; 
(xi)  In  view  of  this  judgment,  the  pending  execution
application  for  execution  of  the  decree  will  not  survive.
However, if the  ex parte decree is revived in terms of the
clause (i) above, the execution application shall proceed;
(xii)
The findings recorded in this judgment are only for
the limited purposes of considering the legality and validity
of the  ex parte order and the order by which the defence of
the defendants was struck out.  This judgment will not affect
any  other  proceedings  pending  between  the  parties  and  all
contentions therein are left open;
(xiii)
The Appeals are partly allowed on above terms; and
(xiv)
The Registry is directed to immediately return the
11

record of the suit along with a copy of this judgment to the
Trial Court. 
CIVIL APPEAL NO.2394/2023
1.
As the execution application has been disposed of in terms of
the judgment passed today in Civil Appeal Nos.2399-2401/2023, this
Appeal does not survive.  The same is disposed of accordingly.
CIVIL APPEAL NO.2395/2023
1.
The  compulsory  acquisition  of  the  property  claimed  by  the
appellants was initiated by the State Government, which has been
set aside by the impugned judgment.  The appellants cannot have any
grievance about setting aside the acquisition.  Hence, no case for
interference with the impugned order is made out.  The Appeal is,
accordingly, dismissed.
CIVIL APPEAL NO.2396/2023
1.
As the execution application has been disposed of in terms of
the judgment passed today in Civil Appeal Nos.2399-2401/2023, this
Appeal does not survive.  The same is disposed of accordingly.
CIVIL APPEAL NO.2398/2023
1.
The application made by the appellant under Rule 97 Order XXI
of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, has been dismissed by the
executing  Court  on  the  ground  that  the  appellant  was  not  in
possession.  It is an admitted position that the appellant was not
in possession.  Therefore, we find no error in the view taken under
the impugned order.  The Appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.
12

CIVIL APPEAL NO.2402/2023
1.
As the decree dated 24th August, 2002 has been set aside in
terms  of  the  judgment  in  Civil  Appeal  Nos.2399-2401/2023,  this
Appeal does not survive.  The Appeal is disposed of accordingly by
keeping all the contentions in the restored suit expressly open.
CIVIL APPEAL NO.2403/2023
1.
Admittedly, this Appeal arises from the orders passed in the
execution of the decree dated 24th August 2002.  Therefore, in view
of  the  judgment  passed  today  in  Civil  Appeal  Nos.2399-2401/2023
setting aside the decree dated 24th August 2002, this Appeal will
not survive, and the same is disposed of accordingly.
