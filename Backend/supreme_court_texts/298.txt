held in favour of the appellants had been set 
aside and the appeal was dismissed.  
Brief facts in nutshell are as follows: 
3. 
The firm-respondent no.3, had taken a loan 
from the respondent no.1-Bank. However, as it 
went 
into 
default, 
the 
Bank 
initiated 
proceedings under the Securitisation and 
Reconstruction 
of 
Financial 
Assets 
and 
Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 20023. In 
the said recovery proceedings, the Recovery 
Officer conducted an open auction. The 
appellants were the highest bidder. Their bid 
was accepted and they made good the deposits 
as per the terms of this auction. Accordingly, a 
sale certificate was issued in their favour on 
30.03.2009.  It may be noted here that the 
appellants were tenants of the borrower in the 
premises in question which had been put to 
auction.  As such the status of the appellants 
changed from that of tenants to that of owners 
after the sale was confirmed and sale certificate 
was issued.

4. 
The borrower-respondent nos.3 and 4 filed a 
securitization application under Section 17 of 
the SARFAESI Act for setting aside the sale on 
the ground that the Bank had not followed the 
statutory procedure prescribed under the 
Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 20024, in 
particular, the notice as required under Rules 
8(6) and 8(7) which required a mandatory notice 
of 30 days to the borrower, had neither been 
issued nor served upon the borrower.   
5. 
The DRT, after examining the matter, came to 
the conclusion that the Bank itself had admitted 
that the statutory compliance under the above 
rules had not been made and as such proceeded 
to set aside the sale vide order dated 
21.04.2015. The operative portion of the order 
passed by the DRT is reproduced hereunder: 
“…The sale as pointed out earlier is liable 
to be quashed for the non-compliance of 
Rule 8(6) and 8(7) of the Security Interest 
(Enforcement) Rules, 2002. The auction 
purchaser set up his case that he has 
spent huge money on improvement of 
property 
in 
question. 
The 
auction

purchaser has not place on record any 
material to prove the alleged improvements 
in the property. The auction purchaser is 
enjoying this property since 2009 as such 
auction purchaser is not entitled to any 
extra compensation. However, Bank will be 
under obligation to refund the auction 
money with interest as applicable to fixed 
deposit. The sale is accordingly set aside 
and it is made clear that Bank will refund 
the auction money only after receiving 
possession 
of 
property 
from 
auction 
purchaser within 15 days from the delivery 
of auction purchaser to the Bank. The 
applicant is directed to pay the dues of the 
sic within 15 days with upto date interest, 
failing which Bank will be at liberty to 
proceed further under Securitization and 
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and 
Enforcement of Security Interest Act 2002 
to recover its dues.

6. 
In effect the DRT, after setting aside the sale, 
further proceeded to direct the Bank to refund 
the auction money with interest as applicable to 
fixed deposits only after receiving possession of 

SLP (C) No. 24155 of 2018 
 
Page 5 of 12 
 
the property from the auction purchaser within 
15 days thereof.  The borrower was directed to 
pay the dues of the Bank within 15 days with 
up to date interest, failing which the Bank 
would be at liberty to proceed further under the 
SARFAESI Act for recovery of its dues. 
7. 
The appellants preferred an appeal before the 
DRAT registered as Appeal No. R-57 of 2015, 
which came to be dismissed, vide order dated 
19.04.2018. 
 
Thereafter 
the 
appellants 
approached the High Court by way of a Writ 
Petition registered as Writ Petition (C) No.20266 
of 2018, which has since been dismissed by the 
impugned judgment and order, giving rise to the 
present appeal. 
8. 
The submission advanced by learned counsel 
for the appellants is two-fold: firstly, that they 
were bonafide purchasers for value and, 
therefore, the DRT, the DRAT and the High 
Court erred in setting aside the sale and 
confirming it.  The second submission advanced 
is that after the sale certificate was issued, the 
appellants have developed the suit property and 
have invested approximately Rs.60 lacs and in 

SLP (C) No. 24155 of 2018 
 
Page 6 of 12 
 
case the sale is to be set aside, the appellants 
should be suitably compensated not only by 
refund of the auction money along with interest 
but also for the improvements made by them in 
developing the property and investment made 
therein. 
9. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the 
respondent-Bank submitted that although it 
had followed the procedure prescribed but could 
not substantiate with any material to rebut the 
findings recorded by the DRT, DRAT and the 
High Court that the Bank had failed to follow the 
statutory provisions of notice under Rules 8(6) 
and 8(7) of the 2002 Rules. It was further 
submitted that as the appellants have enjoyed 
the property as it was already in their 
possession, they cannot claim any additional 
compensation for the improvements made by 
them as they were well aware of the litigation 
initiated by the borrower by filing an application 
under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act and 
whatever improvements have been made were at 
their own risk. 

SLP (C) No. 24155 of 2018 
 
Page 7 of 12 
 
10. Further, learned counsel for the borrower 
(respondent nos.3 and 4) submitted that they 
have already paid the entire outstanding dues of 
the Bank without adjusting the auction money 
received by the Bank which is lying separately 
in an escrow account because of the litigation.  
It was also submitted that the Bank admits that 
the entire dues have been paid but at the same 
time it has declined to issue the No Dues 
Certificate because of pendency of the litigation. 
It was also submitted that the Bank, without 
following due procedure, had conducted the 
auction and, therefore, the DRT rightly set aside 
the sale which has been confirmed by the DRAT 
and the High Court. 
11. From the facts, as narrated above and the 
arguments advanced, the following is the 
admitted position: 
(i). 
The appellants were tenants in the 
premises in question which had been put 
up for auction. Their possession and 
status as tenants were converted into that 
of owners after the sale was confirmed and 
the sale certificate issued; 

SLP (C) No. 24155 of 2018 
 
Page 8 of 12 
 
(ii). The borrowers have admitted that they 
were in default and that the Bank had a 
right to recover its dues in accordance to 
law; 
 
(iii). After the auction sale, the borrowers have 
deposited the entire outstanding amount 
independent of the auction money which is 
additionally lying with the Bank; 
 
(iv). The Bank has admitted that there was 
non-compliance of the statutory provisions 
in conducting the sale and as such had 
conceded before the DRT that the sale in 
question may be set aside and the Bank be 
granted liberty to proceed afresh; 
 
(v). 
The Bank has admitted that the auction 
money of Rs.12.40 lacs is lying in a 
separate fixed deposit and this amount is 
in addition to the outstanding amount 
deposited by the borrower after the auction 
sale.   

SLP (C) No. 24155 of 2018 
 
Page 9 of 12 
 
12. Considering the above facts and circumstances 
and the arguments advanced, we proceed to 
deal with the same:  
(i). 
In view of the concurrent finding based on 
the admission by the Bank that mandatory 
notice of 30 days was not given to the 
Borrower before holding the auction/sale, 
the setting aside of the auction/sale 
cannot be faulted with. The same has to be 
approved. 
(ii). Once the sale is set aside, the status of the 
appellants as owners would automatically 
revert to that of tenants. The status of 
possession at best could have been altered 
from that of an owner to that of tenants but 
Bank would not have any right to claim 
actual 
physical 
possession 
from 
the 
appellants nor would the appellants be 
under any obligation to handover physical 
possession to the Bank. The DRT fell in 
error on the said issue. Therefore, the 
direction issued by the DRT that the Bank 
will first take possession and thereafter 
refund the auction money with interest 

SLP (C) No. 24155 of 2018 
 
Page 10 of 12 
 
applicable to fixed deposits, is not a correct 
direction; 
(iii). The entire controversy has arisen because 
of the Bank not following the prescribed 
mandatory procedure for conducting the 
auction sale and, therefore, the Bank must 
suffer and should be put to terms for 
unnecessarily creating litigation.  As of 
date the dues of the Bank have been fully 
discharged and an additional amount of 
the auction money is lying with the Bank 
since 2009. This amount is to be returned 
to the appellants. In such facts and 
circumstances of the case, we are of the 
view that the award of interest on the 
auction money at the rate applicable to 
fixed deposits is not a correct view.  The 
rate of interest deserves to be enhanced. 
(iv). We could have considered awarding 24 per 
cent per annum compound interest on the 
auction money to be refunded to the 
appellants in view of serious illegality 
committed by the Bank in conducting the 
auction 
and 
driving 
the 
parties 
to 

SLP (C) No. 24155 of 2018 
 
Page 11 of 12 
 
litigation. Considering the fact that the 
money of the Bank is also public money, 
we feel that interest of justice would be 
best served   if the auction money with 12 
per cent per annum compound interest is 
returned to the appellants.  Such interest 
be calculated from the date of deposit till 
the date it is actually paid. 
(v). 
There was some dispute between the Bank 
and the borrower that there could be minor 
adjustments still left. We are of the view 
that if any additional amount is lying with 
the Bank, the same would be returned to 
the borrower and if any amount is still due 
to be paid, the borrower would pay the said 
amount to the Bank. The Bank and the 
borrower have both agreed for making the 
said adjustments. 
13.   In view of the above discussion and analysis, the 
following directions are issued:  
a) setting aside of the auction sale is affirmed. 
b) The status of the appellants as tenants shall 
stand restored leaving it open for the borrower 

SLP (C) No. 24155 of 2018 
 
Page 12 of 12 
 
as owner of the property to evict the appellants 
in accordance to law. 
c) The entire auction/sale money lying with the 
Bank (R-1 & 2) shall be returned to the 
appellants along with compound interest @12 
per cent per annum to be calculated from the 
date of deposit till the date of payment. 
d) The Borrower Respondent nos.3 and 4 and 
the Bank–Respondent nos.1 and 2, would 
streamline their accounts and the Bank upon 
settlement of the same will issue a No Dues 
Certificate to the Borrower. 
14. The impugned order shall stand modified as 
above. 
The 
appeal 
stands 
disposed 
of 
accordingly.   
15. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
