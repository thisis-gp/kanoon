Bench of the High Court accepted the writ petition2 preferred by 
the private respondents herein3 and reversed the judgment dated 
24th December, 2010 passed by the Central Administrative 
Tribunal, Madras Bench4 in Original Application5 preferred by the 
private respondents herein. The CAT had rejected the Original 
Application6, challenging the proposed action of revision and 
fixation of their seniority in the Engine Factory, Avadi, Chennai7. 
2. 
The brief facts in a nutshell, relevant and essential for the 
disposal of the instant appeal are noted hereinbelow. 
3. 
The appellant and the private respondents were engaged on 
semi-skilled posts such as Fitters and Machinists in respondent 
No.2-Factory. A common select list of candidates based on merit 
was issued by the General Manager of respondent No.2-Factory in 
the year 1995 wherein the appellant herein was placed at a higher 
position than the private respondents.  An appointment order 
dated 17th January, 1996 was issued in the favour of the appellant 
for the post of ‘Fitter General(semi-skilled)’ in respondent No.2-
Factory. He was initially placed on probation for a period of two

3 
 
years which was further extended for a period of six months w.e.f. 
17th January, 1998. The appellant satisfactorily completed the 
probation period on 16th July, 1998. Thereafter, he was promoted 
to the ‘Skilled’ grade on 6th January, 1999.   
4. 
A draft seniority list dated 28th July, 2006 was issued by 
respondent No.2-Factory, whereby the seniority of ‘Fitters’ was 
fixed as per their respective dates of promotion to the skilled grade 
and the appellant was placed at a lower position than the private 
respondents.  
5. 
Aggrieved of the draft seniority list8, the appellant submitted 
a representation dated 13th November, 2006 to the General 
Manager 
of 
respondent 
No.2-Factory 
seeking 
necessary 
amendments in the draft seniority list and to fix his position 
appropriately and thereafter, to publish a final seniority list. The 
General Manager rejected the aforesaid representation submitted 
by the appellant vide communication dated 9th July, 2007, 
observing that his seniority had been fixed from the date of holding 
the skilled grade, and thus the position of the appellant in the 
seniority list was not liable to be altered. 
 
8 Dated 28th July, 2006 

4 
 
6. 
Being aggrieved, the appellant preferred Original Application 
No. 821 of 2007 before the CAT challenging the draft seniority list 
dated 28th July, 2006. 
7. 
Another employee, namely, Mr. P. Kumaresan who was 
appointed as a Mechanist in respondent No.2-Factory in January 
1996, also filed Original Application No. 831 of 2007, before the 
CAT, wherein Mr. P. Kumaresan also claimed that he had to be 
placed at the 6th position instead of the 27th position as set out in 
the draft seniority list. Original Application9 preferred by Mr. P. 
Kumaresan came to be allowed by the CAT holding that the 
seniority fixed in the draft list was incorrect. The CAT noted that 
respondent No.2-Factory had allowed the promotion to the juniors 
of Mr. P. Kumaresan on the ground that he was still undergoing 
the extended period of probation. The CAT held that it is settled 
law that once the extended period of probation is completed, the 
employee should be confirmed in service from the date of initial 
selection and should be assigned the original rank in the seniority 
list. Thus, once the extended period of probation came to an end 
and the employee was found suitable, he had to be confirmed in 
 
9 Original Application No. 831 of 2007 

5 
 
service, promoted with seniority and all consequential benefits to 
the next grade with reference to the date of initial appointment. 
8. 
The CAT allowed Original Application No. 821 of 2007 
preferred by the appellant herein vide order dated 23rd January, 
2009, basing its decision on the order passed in Original 
Application No. 831 of 2007 considering the fact that both the 
workers were identically employed in respondent No.2-Factory and 
directed that the appellant was entitled to be considered for his 
claim of seniority and directed the respondents10 to revise the 
seniority list accordingly.  
9. 
The private respondents herein filed Original Application No. 
318 of 2009 before CAT against the proposed action of revision of 
seniority list and promotions in accordance with the order dated 
23rd January, 2009 passed in the Original Application No. 821 of 
2007 filed by the appellant. The said Original Application11 was 
dismissed by CAT vide order dated 24th December, 2010 while 
granting the liberty to the applicants therein(private respondents 
herein) to file a review application for assailing the orders passed 
in Original Application No. 831 of 2007 and Original Application 
No. 821 of 2007. 
 
10 Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 
11 Original Application No.318 of 2009

10. However, private respondents herein rather than filing a 
review application, chose to assail the orders passed by the CAT 
by preferring a Writ Petition12 before the Madras High Court which 
came to be allowed vide order dated 10th October, 2011. The Union 
of India13 and respondent No. 2-Factory were directed by the High 
Court to restore the seniority of the writ petitioners(private 
respondents herein), holding that the writ petitioners are senior to 
the appellant herein, both as per the date of initial appointment 
and also in the promotional post of skilled grade.  The High Court 
held that an employee selected in the semi-skilled grade is required 
to complete the probation period satisfactorily and has to pass the 
requisite trade test prescribed for the post before he can be 
confirmed and promoted to the skilled grade.  Due to the extension 
of the probation period of the respondents in the Writ Petition 
No.583 of 2011(including the appellant herein), they were required 
to be placed below the persons who were promoted to the skilled 
grade earlier to them. The High Court held that in the skilled grade, 
the writ petitioners(private respondents herein) were senior to the 
third respondent(appellant herein). It was also held that the 
promotions to the skilled grade and the highly skilled grade were 
 
12 Writ Petition No. 583 of 2011 
13 Respondent No. 1 

7 
 
carried out in the years 1998 and 2003, respectively but the third 
respondent (appellant herein) chose to file the Original 
Application14 in the year 2007 and no reason was forthcoming for 
the gross delay. The relevant extract from the High Court’s 
judgment dated 10th October, 2011 is reproduced hereinbelow: - 
“7. A mere reading of the counter affidavit would show that the 
probation of the third respondent in W.P. No. 583 of 2011 was 
extended by six months and for the third respondent in W.P. 
No. 584 of 2011, it was extended by three months by virtue of 
their failure to complete probation of two years and to pass the 
required trade test prescribed for the posts. Accordingly, the 
third respondent in W.P. No. 583 of 2011 was placed in the 
skilled grade only with effect from 6.1.1999 and third 
respondent in W.P. No. 584 of 2011 was promoted only with 
effect from 5.10.1998 whereas the petitioners in both the 
petitions were promoted to the skilled grade on 3.7.1998. 
 
8. It is not in dispute that the Semi-Skilled grade is only has to 
complete the probation period satisfactorily and pass the 
requisite trade tests prescribed for the posts. In the present 
case, it is clear that due to extension of the probation period, 
the respondents were placed below the persons who were 
promoted to Skilled grade earlier than them. Even if the date of 
appointment is taken into consideration, the petitioners are 
seniors to the third respondent in these petitions. 
 
9. That apart, the petitioners were promoted to the skilled grade 
in the year 1998 and to the highly skilled grade in the year 
2003. But the third respondent in these petitions have chosen 
to file the original applications only in the year 2007 and no 
reason is forthcoming for the delay. 
 
10. In view of the counter affidavit filed by the Department 
which is in favour of the petitioners and the fact that the 
petitioners are seniors to the third respondent in these petitions 
both as per the date of initial appointment and also the date of 
promotion to the skilled grade, we are of the view that revising 
the seniority list at the instance of the third respondent in the 
Writ Petitions in the guise of implementing the order of the 
Tribunal, is illegal. Therefore, in our considered opinion, the 
order of the Tribunal is to be interfered with. 
 
14 Original Application No. 821 of 2007 

8 
 
 
11. For the aforesaid reasons, the writ petitions are allowed and 
the order of the Tribunal is set aside. The respondents 1 and 2 
are directed to restore the seniority of the petitioners confirming 
their original date of promotion to the Highly Skilled Grade. 
After revising the seniority, the respondents are further directed 
to consider the case of the petitioners for subsequent promotion 
on par with their juniors.”

The judgment dated 10th October, 2011 passed by the 
Division Bench of the High Court is the subject matter of challenge 
in the instant appeal. 
Submissions on behalf of the appellant:  
11. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant urged that the 
High Court premised its findings on a totally erroneous reasoning 
that the challenge laid by the appellant to the draft seniority list 
was delayed and that the private respondents herein(writ 
petitioners) were senior to the appellant as on the date of initial 
appointment. 
12. Learned counsel contended that the draft seniority list in the 
appellant’s cadre was published in the year 2006 for the first time 
after the appointment of the appellant as well as the private 
respondents. Immediately on receiving the draft seniority list, the 
appellant herein made a representation against the same and 
when a favourable decision was not forthcoming, he approached 

9 
 
the CAT for challenging the validity thereof. He submitted that the 
finding of the High Court that the private respondents herein(writ 
petitioners) were senior to the appellant as on the date of initial 
appointment is totally against the record.   
13. He further urged that the extant rules do not provide that the 
promotion from Fitter(semi-skilled) to Fitter(skilled) would be 
dependent on passing the trade test. Thus, as soon as the 
appellant completed the probation period, his services would have 
to be confirmed and reckoned from the date of initial appointment, 
and by virtue thereof, the appellant would be entitled to be placed 
above the private respondents in the order of seniority.  
14. Learned counsel submitted that the period spent during 
training/probation has to be reckoned for computation of length 
of service and the same cannot be excluded while assigning 
seniority to an employee. In support of his arguments, learned 
counsel placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in the case 
of L. Chandrakishore Singh v. State of Haryana15.   
15. He further submitted that the movement of the employee 
from semi-skilled to skilled grade tantamounts to confirmation/ 
upgradation and not a promotion. In support of this contention, 
 
15 AIR 1975 SC 613 

10 
 
reliance was placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of 
BSNL v. R. Santhakumari Velusamy16. 
16. Learned counsel also placed reliance on the Office 
Memorandum17 dated 4th November,1992, issued by the 
Government of India, Department of Personnel and Training, 
which was in force at the time when the appellant and the private 
respondents were appointed, wherein, it is provided: - 
“Seniority for Promotion 
 
Order effective from 4th November, 1992 
 
[Government of India, Department of Personnel and Training, 
Office Memorandum No. 20011/5/90-Estt. (D), dated the 4th 
November, 1992] 
 
Seniority to be determined by the order of merit indicated at the 
time of initial appointment.- The seniority of Government 
servants is determined in accordance with the general 
principles of seniority contained in M.Η.Α., Ο.Μ. No. 9/11155-
RPS, dated the 22nd December, 1959 (See Section II). One of 
the basic principles enunciated in the said OM is that, seniority 
follows confirmation and consequently permanent officers in 
each grade shall rank senior to those who are officiating in that 
grade. 
 
2. This principle has been coming under judicial scrutiny in a 
number of cases in the past; the last important judgment being 
the one delivered by the Supreme Court on 2-5-1990, in the 
case of Class II Direct Recruits Engineering Officers' 
Association v. State of Maharashtra. In Para. 47 (A) of the said 
judgment, the Supreme Court has held that once an incumbent 
is appointed to a post according to rule, his seniority has to be 
counted from the date of his appointment and not-according to 
the date of his confirmation. 
 
3. The general principle of seniority mentioned above has been 
examined in the light of the judicial pronouncement referred to 
 
16 (2011) 9 SCC 510 
17 ‘OM’, hereafter 

11 
 
above and it has been decided that seniority may be delinked 
from confirmation as per the directive of the Supreme Court in 
Para, 47 (A) of its judgment, dated 2-5- 1990. Accordingly, in 
modification of the General Principle 3, proviso to General 
Principle 4 and proviso to General Principle 5 (i) contained 
in O.M. No. 9/11155-RPS, dated the 22nd December, 1959 
and Para. 2.3 of O.M., dated the 3rd July, 1986, it has been 
decided that the seniority of a person regularly appointed 
to a post according to rule would be determined by the 
order of merit indicated at the time of initial appointment 
and not according to the date of confirmation. 
 
4. These orders shall take effect from the date of issue of this 
Office Memorandum. Seniority already determined according to 
the existing principles on the date of issue of these orders will 
not be reopened even if in some cases seniority has already 
been challenged or is in dispute and it will continue to be 
determined on the basis of the principles already existing prior 
to the date of issue of these orders.” 
                                                        (emphasis supplied) 
He thus urged that the seniority of a person regularly 
appointed would have to be reckoned based on the merit indicated 
at the time of the initial appointment and not as per the date of 
confirmation. To support this submission, he also placed reliance 
on the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in Direct Recruit 
Class II Engg. Officers’ Assn. v. State of Maharashtra18. 
He thus implored the Court to accept the appeal, set aside 
the impugned judgment rendered by the High Court, and restore 
the judgment of the CAT. 
 
 
 
18 (1990) 2 SCC 715 

12 
 
Submissions on behalf of the respondents:  
17. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for respondent Nos. 1 
and 2 submitted that the appellant was appointed as Fitter 
General(semi-skilled) on 17th January, 1996. The semi-skilled 
grade is only a trainee grade and in order to be confirmed in service 
and for being promoted to the skilled grade, the employee would 
have to complete the probation period satisfactorily and pass the 
requisite trade test prescribed for promotion to the skilled grade.  
Only on passing the trade test, the employee would qualify for a 
permanent status and promotion to the skilled grade. 
18. He further submitted that it is a settled law that in cases 
where there are no rules governing the field, it is the placement in 
the initial merit list that will decide the seniority, however, if the 
rules are in vogue, then the same will prevail. In this regard, he 
placed reliance on Suresh Chandra Jha v. State of Bihar and 
Others19. 
19. Learned counsel for the respondents placed reliance on 
Statutory Regulatory Order20 No. 185 of 1994 dated 1st November, 
1994 to urge that any appointment in the industrial establishment 
 
19 (2007) 1 SCC 405 
20 ‘SRO’, hereafter 

13 
 
is done against the skilled grade and hence, the period spent in 
the semi-skilled grade till completion of probation period and 
qualifying the prescribed trade test for promotion to the skilled 
grade is considered only as a trainee grade. Resultantly, the 
seniority/merit position at the time of induction in the trainee 
grade would have no bearing on the inter se seniority of the 
employees which would have to be reckoned from the date the 
employee is confirmed and promoted to the skilled grade upon 
completing the probation period and clearing the trade test.  
20. He further placed reliance upon the Government Order21 
dated 24th December, 2002 issued by the Ordinance Factory 
Board, Ministry of Defence, Government of India, which was issued 
to clarify the counting of seniority in trades mentioned in SRO No. 
185 of 1994 applicable to the Industrial Establishments and urged 
that the said GO clarifies beyond the pale of doubt that the semi-
skilled grade is a trainee grade and  the seniority will be counted 
from the date of  promotion to the skilled grade and not from the 
date of induction/entry in the semi-skilled grade. 
 
21 ‘GO’, hereafter 

14 
 
21. Learned counsel pointed out that the two years’ probation 
period of the appellant was extended by six months w.e.f. 17th 
January, 1998, and the appellant could complete the probation 
period only on 16th July, 1998. Subsequently, upon passing the 
trade test, he was promoted to the skilled grade w.e.f. 6th January, 
1999. The appellant lost the seniority on account of his failure to 
complete probation in the period of two years and clearing the 
trade test whereas, the private respondents herein had completed 
probation in time and were found to be fit in the trade test and 
therefore, they were promoted to the skilled grade much before the 
appellant. Consequently, these employees i.e. private respondents 
herein were placed higher in seniority, as per clarification issued 
by Ordinance Factory Board vide GO dated 24th December, 2002.  
 
On these grounds, learned counsel for the respondents 
implored the Court to dismiss the appeal and affirm the order 
passed by the High Court. 
22. Learned counsel for the private respondents herein22 adopted 
the submissions advanced by learned counsel for respondent Nos. 
1 and 2. 
 
22 Respondent Nos. 3, 4, and 5 

15 
 
23. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the 
submissions advanced at the bar by learned counsel for the parties 
and have gone through the impugned judgment and the material 
placed on record. 
Discussion and Conclusion: 
24. The fact that the appellant and private respondents were 
inducted as semi-skilled grade employees in respondent No. 2-
Factory in the year 1996 is not in dispute. The common select list 
dated 22nd November, 1995 is not placed on record by the parties. 
However, appellant filed an RTI23, and the reply thereto dated 29th 
December, 2011 clearly shows that at the time of initial induction, 
appellant was placed at the 7th position, whereas the private 
respondents24 were placed at the 30th, 31st and 32nd positions, 
respectively in the select list based on merit. 
25. The Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned 
judgment dated 10th October, 2011 has recorded a categoric 
finding that even if the date of appointment is taken into 
consideration, the writ petitioners(private respondents herein) are 
senior to respondent No.3(appellant herein).  This finding seems to 
 
23 Right to Information 
24  Respondent Nos. 3, 4 and 5 

16 
 
be prima facie erroneous because admittedly, the appellant herein 
was placed at 7th position and the private respondents were placed 
at the 30th, 31st and 32nd positions in the order of merit, as borne 
out from the record.  Further, in writ petition25 filed by the private 
respondents before the High Court and the counter affidavit filed 
by the respondents herein before this Court, there is no averment 
that these respondents were placed above to the appellant at the 
time of initial appointment. Rather the sole ground taken by the 
writ petitioners(private respondents herein) to oppose the prayer of 
the appellant was that the appellant was not able to complete his 
probation period and pass the trade test on time and thus, he was 
placed below the private respondents in the draft seniority list. 
26. Before we adjudicate upon the issue of inter se seniority 
amongst the litigating parties, we find it necessary to comment on 
the appellant’s approach towards filing his claim concerning his 
promotion in the highly skilled grade. 
27. The appellant and the private respondents faced a common 
selection process and were appointed in the semi-skilled grade in 
the year 1996. The private respondents herein were promoted to 
 
25 Writ Petition No. 583 of 2011 

17 
 
the skilled grade on 11th January, 1998 and further promoted to 
the highly skilled grade on 20th May, 2003. On the other hand, the 
appellant was promoted to the skilled grade on 17th July, 
1998(after completing his extended probation period of 6 months 
and clearing the mandatory trade test). Considering that the 
private respondents were promoted to highly skilled grade in May, 
2003, the appellant in the normal course should also have been 
promoted to highly skilled grade by the end of the year 2003. 
However, as per the factual matrix, he was promoted to the highly 
skilled grade after around 5 years i.e. on 26th March, 2008. A 
tabular chart depicting the date of appointment and the date of 
promotion to skilled and highly skilled grade is placed below: -

28. The draft seniority list was published on 28th July, 2006.  The 
appellant never questioned the denial of promotion to the highly 
skilled grade, till much after the publication of the draft seniority 
list. Admittedly, co-employees who were below the appellant in the 
select list of the year 1996 were promoted in the intervening period 
without any objection being raised by the appellant. After the 
publication of the draft seniority list in the year 2006, he chose to 
challenge the same and to consider his promotion to highly skilled 
grade with effect from 20th May, 2003 by filing an Original 
Application26 before CAT only in the year 2007. Thus, it was the 
first time in 2007 that the appellant claimed his promotion with 
retrospective effect. However, this benefit of retrospective 
promotion was neither granted by the CAT nor by the High Court 
and thus, there is no need to delve into this aspect further.  
29. The primary issue which requires adjudication is as to 
whether the seniority of the appellant is to be reckoned from the 
date of induction/initial appointment or as per the date of 
promotion/confirmation in the skilled grade.  
 
26 Original Application No. 821 of 2007 

19 
 
30. It is a well-settled proposition that once an incumbent is 
appointed to a post according to the rules, his seniority has to be 
reckoned from the date of the initial appointment and not 
according to the date of confirmation, unless the rules provide 
otherwise. 
31. In the case of L. Chandrakishore Singh v. State of 
Manipur and  Others27, this Court held that in cases of 
probationary or officiating appointments which are followed by a 
confirmation, unless a contrary rule is shown, the services 
rendered as the officiating appointment or on probation cannot be 
ignored while reckoning the length of service for determining the 
position in the seniority list. This view has been reiterated in the 
case of Ajit Kumar Rath v. State of Orissa and Others28.   
32. The Constitution Bench of this Court in Direct Recruit Class 
II Engg Officers’ Assn.(supra) stated the legal position with regard 
to inter se seniority of direct recruits and promotees and while 
doing so, inter alia, it was held that once an incumbent is 
appointed to a post according to rules, his seniority has to be 
 
27 (1999) 8 SCC 287 
28 (1999) 9 SCC 596 

20 
 
counted from the date of his appointment and not according to the 
date of his confirmation. 
33. This Court summarised the legal principles with regard to the 
determination of seniority in Pawan Pratap Singh and Others v. 
Reevan Singh and Others29 in the following terms:  
45. From the above, the legal position with regard to 
determination of seniority in service can be summarised as 
follows: 
(i) The effective date of selection has to be understood in the 
context of the service rules under which the appointment is 
made. It may mean the date on which the process of selection 
starts with the issuance of advertisement or the factum of 
preparation of the select list, as the case may be. 
(ii) Inter se seniority in a particular service has to be 
determined as per the service rules. The date of entry in a 
particular service or the date of substantive appointment is 
the safest criterion for fixing seniority inter se between one 
officer or the other or between one group of officers and the 
other recruited from different sources. Any departure 
therefrom in the statutory rules, executive instructions or 
otherwise must be consistent with the requirements of 
Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. 
(iii) Ordinarily, notional seniority may not be granted from the 
backdate and if it is done, it must be based on objective 
considerations and on a valid classification and must be 
traceable to the statutory rules. 
(iv) The seniority cannot be reckoned from the date of 
occurrence 
of 
the 
vacancy 
and 
cannot 
be 
given 
retrospectively unless it is so expressly provided by the 
relevant service rules. It is so because seniority cannot be 
given on retrospective basis when an employee has not even 
been borne in the cadre and by doing so it may adversely 
affect the employees who have been appointed validly in the 
meantime.

34. Thus, it is trite that when an employee completes the 
probation period and is confirmed in service albeit with some 
delay, the confirmation in service shall relate back to the date of 
the initial appointment. Any departure from this principle in the 
form of statutory rules, executive instructions or otherwise must 
be consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the 
Constitution of India. 
35. In the backdrop of the above legal and factual background, 
let 
us 
now 
examine 
if 
whether 
the 
extant 
rules/regulations/circulars prevailing in the establishment30 
contained any stipulation that the completion of the probation 
period and the passing of the trade test is sin qua non for being 
promoted to the skilled grade and if so, whether the seniority of 
the employees selected on the same date would have to be 
reckoned from the date of confirmation/passing the trade test or 
from the date of initial appointment.  
36. A pertinent averment is made in the counter affidavit filed by 
the respondents emphasizing their stand that the semi-skilled 
grade is only a trainee grade and in order to place an employee in 
 
30 respondent No. 2-Factory 

22 
 
the skilled grade, he would have to complete the probation period 
satisfactorily and also clear the trade test as laid down in the SRO 
No. 185 of 1994. The relevant extract from SRO No. 185 of 1994 
dated 1st November, 1994 is reproduced hereinbelow for the sake 
of ready reference. Note 6 of the said SRO reads as below: - 
 
“Note 6. Wherever "Trade Test" is laid down in Column 12 of 
this Schedule such trade test shall be prescribed by the General 
manager of the factory or the Ordnance Factory Board. The 
term "Trade Test” will include written, oral and practical 
examination and aptitude test and interview and also statutory 
qualification test where applicable.” 
 
37. The GO dated 24th December, 2002 issued by the Ordinance 
Factory Board placed on record clarifies the position regarding 
counting of seniority in the trades of SRO No. 185 of 1994 for the 
industrial establishments. The language of this GO is considered 
germane to the controversy and hence, the relevant portion thereof 
is extracted hereinbelow: - 
“With a view to overcome doubts in counting of seniority in 
respect of industrial employees who are working in trades listed 
at Annexure 'A' of SRO 185/1994 it has been decided to 
interpret rules relating to seniority in consonance with existing 
SRO 
provisions. 
Accordingly, 
the 
following 
rules 
for 
determining seniority may be followed in all OFs with 
immediate effect. 
1) Semi-skilled posts are training post for skilled posts of 
trades listed at Annexure 'A' of SRO 185/1994. 
2) Educational Qualification/Technical Qualification will not be 
deciding factor while counting seniority for trades listed at 
Annexure 'A' of SRO 185/1994. 

23 
 
However, where passing of trade test/competency test or 
any other statutory certificate is required, the same must 
be adhered to and cannot be done away with. 
3) Seniority will be counted from the date of promotion to 
Skilled 
grade 
and 
not 
from 
the 
date 
of 
induction/entry/promotion in semi-skilled grade. 
4)…… 
5)…… 
6) The above orders are in consonance with the existing SRO 
provisions and various court orders on the subject.” 
                                                         (emphasis supplied) 
38. The validity of this GO31 was never assailed by the appellant 
at any stage either before the CAT or the High Court. A conjoint 
reading of SRO No. 185 of 1994 and the GO dated 24th December, 
2002, which indisputably were applicable to the cadre of semi-
skilled and skilled fitters in the respondent establishment32 at the 
relevant point of time would make it clear that the seniority in the 
skilled grade would have to be reckoned from the date of promotion 
to the skilled grade and not from the date of induction/entry in the 
semi-skilled grade and the candidate joining service in the semi-
skilled grade would be mandatorily required to complete the 
probation period and also to clear the trade test for being promoted 
to the skilled grade.  In the event of either of the two conditions not 
 
31   Dated 24th December, 2002 
32   Engine Factory, Avadi, Chennai 

24 
 
being met, the employee concerned would not be entitled to be 
promoted to the skilled grade. 
39. The appellant, in support of his plea, has placed reliance on 
a GO dated 4th August, 2015, whereby the GO dated 24th 
December, 2002 has been superseded and it has been decided by 
the Competent Authority that “henceforth”, the seniority in respect 
of Industrial Establishments would be governed by the relevant 
clause of OM dated 4th November, 1992(reproduced supra). The 
said GO dated 4th August, 2015 is reproduced hereinbelow for the 
sake of ready reference: - 
“No. Per/I/Seniority/2015-16                       Date: 04-08-2015 
    
           To 
           The Sr. General Managers/ General Managers 
           All Ordnance & Ordnance Equipment Factories 
 
 
Sub: Determination of Seniority in connection with direct 
Recruitment in the Industrial Establishment. 
Ref: (i) OFB Circular No. 590/OFBOL/A/I dated 24.12.2002 
       (ii) OFB Circular No. 590/OFBOL/A/I dated 13.01.2003 
 
In connection with counting of Seniority in Annexure-A 
trades of SRO 185/1994 in the Industrial Establishment, above 
referred OFB Circulars clarified and directed that seniority in 
respect of Industrial Employees will be counted from the date 
of up-gradation to Skilled Grade and not from the date of 
induction/entry/promotion in the Semi-skilled grade. 

25 
 
Several references in this regard have been received at 
OFB and after due examination, it has been observed that the 
OFB Circulars under reference are not in line with the 
principles of seniority as laid down by DOPT from time to time. 
Therefore, the Competent Authority has decided that in 
supersession of the above referred OFB Circulars dated 
24.12.2002 and 13.01.2003, henceforth, seniority in respect 
of IEs will be governed by the relevant clause of DOPT OM 
No.20011/5/90-Estt(D) dated 4th November, 1992 and OM 
No.22011/7/86-Estt(D) dated 3rd July, 1986. Accordingly, 
promotion from Skilled to Highly Skilled Grade-II will be made 
as per the seniority fixed for Semi-skilled grade (entry grade) 
which will be arrived at as per merit of the select panel, without 
making any linkage to the date of up-gradation to the Skilled 
Grade. 
It may so happen that a person lower in the merit list of 
recruitment (in Semi-skilled grade) joins earlier due to early 
clearance of PVR. In such case, the person lower in the merit 
list will complete his/her qualifying service and be up-graded 
to Skilled Grade on earlier date as compared to a person higher 
in the merit list. However, person higher in the merit list will 
not lose his seniority and will be placed above the person lower 
in the merit list after getting up-gradation to Skilled Grade.

(emphasis supplied) 
 
40. By virtue of the above GO33, the rule position qua the fixation 
of seniority has been restored to be governed by OM dated 4th 
November, 1992(reproduced supra), according to which the 
relevant date for fixation of seniority would be the date of initial 
appointment and not the date of upgradation/promotion to the 
skilled grade. The OM dated 4th August, 2015 further clarifies that 
 
33  Dated 4th August, 2015 

26 
 
the person higher in the merit list will not lose his seniority and 
will be placed above the person lower in the merit list after getting 
upgradation to the skilled grade. 
41. However, the clarification issued vide GO dated 4th August, 
2015 does not operate retrospectively as it is specifically provided 
in the said GO that “henceforth”, the seniority in respect of 
Industrial Establishments will be governed by the relevant clause 
of OM dated 4th November, 1992.  
42. It is trite law that an Office Memorandum/Government Order 
cannot have a retrospective effect unless and until there is an 
express provision to make its effect retrospective or that the 
operation thereof is retrospective by necessary implication. In this 
regard, we are benefitted by the observations of this Court in Sonia 
v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. and Others34, wherein it was held 
that: 
“11. ….In any view of the matter, law is well settled that 
an Office Memorandum cannot have a retrospective effect 
unless and until intention of the authorities to make it as 
such is revealed expressly or by necessary implication in 
the Office Memorandum.” 
 
 
34 (2007) 10 SCC 627 

27 
 
43. If a Government Order is treated to be in the nature of a 
clarification of an earlier Government Order, it may be made 
applicable 
retrospectively. 
Conversely, 
if 
a 
subsequent 
Government Order is held to be a modification/amendment of the 
earlier Government Order, its application would be prospective as 
retrospective application thereof would result in withdrawal of 
vested rights which is impermissible in law and the same may also 
entail recoveries to be made. The principles in this regard were 
culled out by this Court in a recent judgment of Sree 
Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit and Others v. Dr. 
Manu and Another35, in the following terms: - 
“52. From 
the 
aforesaid 
authorities, 
the 
following 
principles could be culled out: 
i) If a statute is curative or merely clarificatory of the 
previous law, retrospective operation thereof may be 
permitted. 
ii) In order for a subsequent order/provision/amendment 
to be considered as clarificatory of the previous law, the 
pre-amended law ought to have been vague or ambiguous. 
It is only when it would be impossible to reasonably 
interpret a provision unless an amendment is read into it, 
that the amendment is considered to be a clarification or 
a declaration of the previous law and therefore applied 
retrospectively. 
iii) An explanation/clarification may not expand or alter 
the scope of the original provision. 
iv) Merely because a provision is described as a 
clarification/explanation, the Court is not bound by the 
said statement in the statute itself, but must proceed to 
analyse the nature of the amendment and then conclude 
 
35 2023 SCC OnLine SC 640 

28 
 
whether it is in reality a clarificatory or declaratory 
provision or whether it is a substantive amendment which 
is intended to change the law and which would apply 
prospectively.” 
 
44. Applying these principles to the case at hand, we are of the 
view that the subsequent GO dated 4th August, 2015 cannot be 
read simply as a clarification and therefore cannot be made 
applicable retrospectively. The said GO has substantively modified 
the position governing seniority in the Industrial Establishments 
by reviving the earlier OM dated 4th November, 1992, and 
supersedes the orders/circulars dated 24th December, 2002 and 
13th January, 2003, which were holding the field over more than a 
decade. Therefore, giving retrospective effect to the GO dated 4th 
August, 2015 would have catastrophic effect on the seniority of the 
entire cadre. 
45. This Court has time and again dealt with the effect of altering 
the seniority list at a belated stage and how it may adversely affect 
the employees whose seniority and rank has been determined in 
the meantime. In this connection, reference may be made to 
Malcom Lawrence Cecil D'Souza v. Union of India and 
Others36, wherein this Court held that: - 
 
36 (1976) 1 SCC 599 

29 
 
“9. Although security of service cannot be used as a shield 
against administrative action for lapses of a public servant, by 
and large one of the essential requirements of contentment and 
efficiency in public services is a feeling of security. It is difficult 
no doubt to guarantee such security in all its varied aspects, it 
should at least be possible to ensure that matters like one's 
position in the seniority list after having been settled for once 
should not be liable to be reopened after lapse of many years….. 
Raking up old matters like seniority after a long time is likely to 
result in administrative complications and difficulties. It would, 
therefore, appear to be in the interest of smoothness and 
efficiency of service that such matters should be given a quietus 
after lapse of some time.” 
46. In R.S. Makashi and Others v. I.M. Menon and Others37, 
this Court observed as follows: - 
“33. …. We must administer justice in accordance with law and 
principles of equity, justice and good conscience. It would be 
unjust to deprive the respondents of the rights which have 
accrued to them. Each person ought to be entitled to sit back 
and consider that his appointment and promotion effected a 
long time ago would not be set aside after the lapse of a number 
of years. ….” 
 
47. In K.R. Mudgal and Others v. R.P. Singh and Others38, 
this Court observed in the following terms: - 
“2. … A government servant who is appointed to any post 
ordinarily should at least after a period of 3 or 4 years of his 
appointment be allowed to attend to the duties attached to his 
post peacefully and without any sense of insecurity.” 
 
48. In B.S. Bajwa and Another v. State of Punjab and 
Others39, this Court held that the seniority list should not be 
 
37 (1982) 1 SCC 379 
38 (1986) 4 SCC 531 
39 (1998) 2 SCC 523 

30 
 
reopened after a lapse of reasonable period as it would disturb the 
settled position which is unjustifiable. The relevant extract is as 
follows: - 
“7. … It is well settled that in service matters the question of 
seniority should not be reopened in such situations after the 
lapse of a reasonable period because that results in disturbing 
the settled position which is not justifiable….” 
 
49. It can easily be inferred that in the intervening period, before 
the GO dated 4th August, 2015 came to be issued, seniority of 
multitudes of employees must have been fixed according to the GO 
dated 24th December, 2002, which is according to the date of 
promotion to skilled grade and 
not from the date of 
induction/entry in semi-skilled grade. As a matter of fact, 
respondent Nos. 3, 4 and 5 who were below the appellant in the 
order of merit at the time of induction in the semi-skilled grade, 
have been promoted to the skilled grade and the highly skilled 
grade much before the appellant by application of the GO dated 
24th December, 2002. The appellant did not question their 
promotions before any Court or Tribunal at any stage.  
50. Thus, much water has flown under the bridge and 
retrospective application of the GO issued in 2015 would open 
floodgates of litigation and would disturb the seniority of many 

31 
 
employees causing them grave prejudice and heartburn as it would 
disturb the crystallized rights regarding seniority, rank and 
promotion which would have accrued to them during the 
intervening period. To alter a seniority list after such a long period 
would be totally unjust to the multitudes of employees who could 
get caught in the labyrinth of uncertainty for no fault of theirs and 
may suffer loss of their seniority rights retrospectively.  
51. Keeping in mind the afore-stated principles, we are of the view 
that applicability of the Government Order dated 4th August, 2015 
cannot enure to the benefit of the appellant as its operation is 
clearly prospective.  
52. In wake of the above discussion, we find that the impugned 
judgment of the High Court does not suffer from any infirmity 
warranting interference. 
53. This appeal is dismissed as being devoid of merit.  No order 
as to costs. 
54. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
