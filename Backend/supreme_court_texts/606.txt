All the conditions imposed by the Central Government while conveying 
the previous approval to the State Government under Section 5(1) of the 
Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 for grant of 
mining lease in favour of captive mining party should clearly form part of 
the lease deed to be executed between the concerned State Government 
and the party. 
(iii) 
In case the captive block has been offered for washing-cum-end 
use, the deed must clearly specify that the beneficiated coal from 
the washery will exclusively be used for the end use (power 
generation) as approved by the Central Government and not for 
commerce or otherwise. Tailings, middlings or rejects, as the case

3.2.3 On 08th December, 2004, the MoC, Government of India issued a letter to 
KECML approving the Mining Plan submitted by it for the Baranj Open Pit Project under 
Section 5(2)(b) of the Mines and Mineral (Development & Regulation) Act, 195720. The 
appellants herein have taken a plea that the Mining Plan did not contain any provision 
contrary to the JVA with respect to the rejects and what KECML was required to do to 
dispose off the rejects, was stipulated under Clause 5(2)(b) of the JVA which required 
it to dispose off the rejects in an environment friendly manner. It was submitted that 
there was no clause in the Mining Plan that ran contrary to the JVA. The said plea has 
however been disputed by the respondent-CBI.

3.3.2  In terms of Articles 2 and 5 of the FSA, a Tripartite Agreement was executed 
between KECML, KPCL and M/s SGS India Private Limited22 on 20th June, 2008. M/s 
SGS was appointed as a third-party agency for purposes of sampling and analysis of 
the coal to be received at BTPS.  
3.3.3 For the sake of completion of narration, it may be noted here that although the

22 In short ‘SGS’ 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 18 of 101 
 
the FSA referred to above was executed on 09th May, 2007, the actual mining and coal 
production could be commenced by KECML only in September, 2008 on account of the 
litigation initiated by M/s Central India Power Company23 against the MoC in relation to 
the coal block allocated to KPCL. In July, 2003 CIPCO filed a writ petition24 before the 
Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court seeking reallocation of coal blocks allocated 
to KPCL. On 21st May, 2006, a status quo order was passed by the High Court in the 
said petition and KECML and KPCL were also made parties. The said petition was 
finally dismissed by the High Court on 10th August, 2006 which dismissal order was 
upheld by this Court on 05th January, 2007. Due to the status quo order operating in all 
this duration, the coal production could commence at site only in September, 2008 and 
washed coal was supplied by KECML to the BTPS w.e.f. December, 2008. Due to non-
supply of washed coal by KPCL as stipulated in Article 6(4) of the JVA and Article 10 
of the FSA, KPCL imposed penalties on KECML for the delay.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 
 3.4.1 Since Article 5(2) of the JVA required the appellants to establish a coal washery 
at the pithead to supply coal of the required specification for the consumption of BTPS 
and there were several layers of clearances required from the authorities to establish 
the washery at the pithead, it is the stand of the appellants that KECML entered into a

3.4.2 The appellants have stated that the draft MoU was sent to KPCL for its approval 
by Mr. Murlidhar Rao, the then Director (Technical) of KPCL and Director of KECML 
and after deliberations between 18th December, 2008 and 12th January, 2009, the same 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 21 of 101 
 
was finally approved and ratified by the Board of KECML on 13th January, 2009. In the 
meeting of the Board of Directors of KECML held on 13th January, 2009, those who had 
participated included Mr. S.M Jaamdar, the then Managing Director of KPCL and 
Chairman of KECML, Mr. R. Balasubramanian, the then Executive Director and 
Company Secretary of KPCL and Director of KECML, Mr. D.C. Sreedhar, the then 
Director (Finance) of KPCL and Director of KECML, Mr. U.K. Upadhyaya, Chairman 
and Managing Director of EMTA and former MD of KECML (appellant No. 2 in the 
appeals). In the Meeting held on 23rd February, 2010, the Board of Directors of KECML 
subsequently concluded that washing of raw coal was necessary since a specific grade 
of coal was required by the BTPS for generation of power and therefore, washed coal 
should continue to be supplied on the same basis.  The appellants have also pointed 
out  that GCWL was known to KPCL that had earlier entered into an agreement with 
GCWL along with two other washery operators for washing of coal mined by Western 
Coalfields Limited. However, the respondent-CBI has questioned the execution of the 
MoU between KECML and GCWL, in particular, Clause 12 thereof.   
3.5 
WASHABILITY REPORT OF THE CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF MINING AND 
FUEL RESEARCH, NAGPUR 
 
3.5.1 In the year 2009, to check the statistics of the coal mine, the appellants 
approached a Government Laboratory, namely, Central Institute of Mining and Fuel 
Research27 for testing of the Integrated Baranj Open Cast Mines28. The team of officers 
 
27 In short ‘CIMFR’ 
28 In short ‘IBOCM’ 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 22 of 101 
 
from CIMFR visited the site, collected 100 MT of coal for testing and furnished a Detailed 
Washability Report. The report states that the rejects did not contain any useful c.v. as 
the GCV of the rejects was 1094 Kcal/Kg and the useful heat value was negative.  
3.6 
REVISED MINING PLAN 
3.6.1  After the mining continued for about two years in terms of the original Mining 
Plan submitted in the year 2004, KPCL decided to increase the capacity of BTPS from 
2.5 Mty to 5 Mty. As a result, the appellants were required to prepare a revised Mining 
Plan for supplying the increased mining demands. On 20th December, 2010, the 
appellants addressed a letter to the MoC for seeking approval of the revised Mining 
Plan. At that stage, a new technology for utilization of the rejects for its carbon value 
was introduced, described as the Fluidised Bed Combustion29. The letter issued by the 
appellants to the MoC mentioned that the rejects generated could be gainfully utilized 
for its carbon content by generating power through FBC/CFBC power plants of 
appropriate capacity. It is not in dispute that the new technology of FBC could have 
been put to use only when a plant in respect of the same was set up for which several 
approvals would be required from various departments besides the process of acquiring 
land for setting up the plant spreading over four to five years, as a power plant could 
not be installed within the mining lease area. The appellants have pleaded that KPCL 
could not have started using the rejects immediately upon receiving approval of the 
revised Mining Plan and that the rejects having optimum useful heat value/GCV i.e. 
 
29 For short FBC. 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 23 of 101 
 
2500 Kcal/kg, could have been used only by applying the FBC technology after such a 
facility was set up. 
 3.6.2 Vide letter dated 24th August, 2011, the MoC approved the revised Mining Plan 
submitted by KECML whereafter the process of obtaining preliminary approvals 
including environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate 
Change, Government of India30 for the enhanced capacity of 5 MTPA coal from 2.5 
MTPA was initiated. While the Terms of Reference was granted by the MoEF&CC, the 
mandatory public hearing required to obtain environment clearance could not be 
conducted since this Court passed an order in the year 2014 deallocating all captive 
coal blocks. Before that, due to disputes that had arisen between KECML and GCWL, 
washing of coal was stopped at the washery of GCWL w.e.f. 22nd May, 2012.  
3.7 
INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY KECML TO THE COAL CONTROLLER 
3.7.1 On 14th December, 2012, the Office of the Coal Controller that falls under the 
MoC called upon the KECML to furnish details in terms of the prescribed formats in 
respect of the production, stock, despatch of coal to the washery etc. Vide letter dated 
16th January, 2013, KECML furnished the detailed data as per the prescribed format. 
The said letter stated that from December, 2008 to December, 2012, approximately  
3,61,000 MT of rejects was generated at the washery; that the ash content of the raw 
coal varied from 35 per cent to 37 per cent and the content of the washed coal varied 
from 32 per cent to 34 per cent; that the yield of the washery was about 95 per cent to 
 
30 In short ‘MoEF&CC’ 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 24 of 101 
 
96 per cent and the residual 4 per cent of the raw coal were rejects whose ash content 
was over 90 per cent and was therefore not marketable. It was further stated that the 
quality of the rejects was so poor that no records were maintained regarding its 
utilization. However, the rejects were used to fill up low land area of siding and road 
between coal blocks to the washery and for pit dumping near the washery. 
3.7.2 To substantiate the statement made that the yield of the washery was 95 to 96 
per cent, the appellants relied on the Washability Report prepared by CIMFR, Nagpur 
unit dated 01st August, 2009 which records that IBOCM coal is amenable to wash with 
yield varying from 90 to 98 per cent at the desired ash level of 32 per cent. The Report 
has recorded that the GCV of the mined coal fit for transporting to BPTS is 4464 Kcal/kg 
and that of the rejects is 1094 Kcal/kg. The data prepared in a format and submitted in 
a tabulated format by KECML to the Coal Controller for the period between the year 
2008-09 and 2012-13 is extracted below: 
 
 
Ash % of Raw coal varies from 35% to 37%  
Ash % of wash coal varies from 32% to 34%  
% age of yield of washed coal varies from 95-96%

The quality of rejects is as good as stone and not saleable 
 
 
Pertinently, the data regarding despatch of coal for washing has been furnished only 
upto May, 2012 since a dispute had arisen between KECML and GCWL thereafter. The 
second last column mentions the total rejects produced at IBOCM as 3,61,343 MT31 
and the rejects consumed as 2,40,000 MT.

AUDIT OBJECTIONS RAISED BY THE COMPTROLLER AND AUDITOR 
GENERAL32 
 
3.8.1 On 31st October, 2013, the Office of the Principal Accountant General (E&RSA), 
Karnataka raised an audit inquiry on KPCL on the subject of non-utilization of the 
washery rejects and the resultant undue benefit of ₹ 53.37 crores to a private company. 
The audit inquiry noted that KECML had engaged a third party agency namely, GCWL 
through a MoU for washing of coal and Clause 12 of the MoU stipulated that rejects 
should be the joint property of KECML and GCWL which ought to be disposed of/sold 
jointly at mutually agreed terms subject to compliance of the relevant rules, 
regulations/guidelines issued by the MoC, if applicable. It was stated that KECML had 
executed the MoU with GCWL to dispose off the rejects without the concurrence of 
KPCL and KPCL did not demand the washery rejects from KECML either for its captive 
consumption or for its disposal. Further, it was stated that no coal could be

Page 26 of 101 
 
sold/delivered/disposed of except for captive mining purpose, i.e., power generation and 
with the previous written approval of the Central Government.  
3.8.2  The observations made by the CAG in Audit Inquiry No. 18 are extracted below: 
“We observed that 
➢ Depending on the type of coal being washed and the requirement of the 
captive user, the rejects and middlings are generated from washery. A 
study report indicates that washing of D-grade coal generates rejects and 
middling of F and G-grade, and such low quality coal was also being used 
in power generation. 
➢  The purpose of allocation of coal blocks for captive use under section 
3(3) of the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973 is not to enable free 
trading of coal by private companies. The basic concept of captive mining 
permitted under the aforesaid Act is that the coal obtained from a captive 
block shall be used entirely and exclusively for the specified and 
approved end use by the allocatee Company and, therefore, the 
production of surplus coal should not result in any undue advantage to 
the captive block allocatee as the coal block is allotted to them for use in 
their end-use plant only and any additional production from the block 
should be made available to the Government for utilization. 
➢ While allocating the coal block in November 2003, the Government 
directed the Company to use the rejects for its own captive consumption. 
➢ In reply to the clarification sought (October 2003) by the Ministry of Coal 
regarding detailed plan about the use of middling, tailings and rejects etc, 
the Company informed (October 2003) that the same was proposed to 
be used for power generation with fluidized-bed boilers. 
Thus, the inaction on the part of the Company resulted in the 
KECML/EMTA disposing the coal rejects without transferring the 
revenue to KPCL. Considering the coal rejects as G-grade based on 
GCV undue benefit afforded to the KECML/EMTA worked out to Rs.

1. 
Audit Inquiry No. 18  
Sub: Non-utilisation of washery rejects by 
the company and resultant undue benefit of 
Rs 52.37crores to private company. 
In November 2003, Government of India 
allocated captive coal blocks in Wardha Valley 
region to the Company to develop it as source 
of supply to its thermal power plant al Bellary. In 
accordance with the requirement of the 
Company, the JV Company (KECML) engaged 
(December 2008) a third party agency, M/s 
Gupta Coalfields and Washeries Limited 
(GCWL), Nagpur through a Memorandum of 
Understanding for washing of coal. Clause 12 
of the MOU stipulated that the rejects should be 
the joint property of KECML and GCWL and it 
should be disposed off/ sold jointly at mutually 
agreed terms, subject to compliance of 
rules/regulations/guidelines of Ministry of Coal, 
Government of India, if applicable. The washing 
of coal was carried out till the end of June 2012 
before it was discontinued due to dispute 
between the parties to the MOU. 
 
KECML entered into MOU with GCWL to 
dispose of the rejects without the concurrence 
of the Company. Despite the fact that the 
Company holds the right on the captive coal 
blocks, no provision was made in the FSA made 
by the Company with KECML for supply of 
rejects/middling. It did not demand the washery 
rejects from KECML either for its captive 
consumption or for its disposal by its own 
means 
with 
the 
approval 
of 
Central 
Government. 
 
The conditions of allocation inter-alia included 
that if the coal was being washed, tailings, 
middling or rejects, as the case may be, from 
washery 
should 
be 
used 
for 
captive 
consumption only by the Company as approved 
by the Central Government. Further, no coal 
shall be sold, delivered, transferred or disposed 
of except for the stated captive mining purpose 
(power generation) and with the previous 
approval of the Central Government in writing. 
 
 We observed that: 
> Depending on the type of coal being 
washed and the requirement of the captive 
 
 
The Audit objection is raised as if the entire rejects 
have been appropriated by KECML and that the 
rejects have a market value of Rs. 52.37 crores. 
These are factually incorrect in view of the following 
: - 
 
a) The assessment of washery rejects does not have 
any direct co-relation with the quantity of coal produced 
at Integrated Baranj OCP, rather, the quantity sent to 
washery and the quantity actually dispatched to the 
thermal power stations of KPCL after the processing in 
the washery are the two important quantities giving idea 
of reject generation at the washery. We are furnishing 
below the year-wise quantity of coal sent to washery 
from Integrated Baranj OCP, the quantity of rejects 
generation and the quantity of coal finally dispatched to 
KPCL.

user, the rejects and middling are generated 
from washery. A study report indicates that 
washing of D-grade coal generates rejects 
and middling of F and G-grade, and such 
low quality coal was also being used in 
power generation.

hardly have any calorific value. Therefore the said 
rejects have been used for leveling, piling etc. 
towards facilitating Integrated Baranj OCP. 
 
c) The Audit comment is a generalized observation 
without any factual support and as such cannot be 
concluded that the washery rejects irrespective of the 
geological location of the source of coal would have 
Useful Heat Value (UHV) to cater to the generation 
requirement. In fact, the rejects generated in the present 
case are only shale and non- coal matter. Hence the 
conclusion drawn by Audit that the rejects are G- grade 
is not only arbitrary but also not based on the ground 
geological realties. 
 
 
 
 
Thus, the abandonment of rejects at the collieries 
end has been resorted to based on its utility, as 
otherwise its transportation would have imposed 
additional burden on the Company. 
 
 
The abandonment of rejects is, therefore, in order.

Though KPCL requested the CAG to drop the audit objection in view of its clarification, 
it is a matter of record that the CAG did not accept the explanation offered by KPCL.  
Instead, CAG observed in its Audit Report for the year ending March, 2013 that coal 
rejects worth ₹ 52.37 crore had been misappropriated by KECML and GCWL on 
account of the inaction on the part of the KPCL.  
3.9 
PRELIMINARY INQUIRY REGISTRED BY RESPONDENT-CBI 
3.9.1 On receiving the Report from the Office of the CAG, KPCL dashed off a letter 
dated 31st July, 2014 to KECML seeking an account of the rejects generated by washing 
of coal and demanded reimbursement of the cost of the rejects. KECML responded vide 
letter dated 14th August, 2014 reiterating therein that the percentage of rejects 
generated at the washery were only 4.39 per cent of the total coal produced at the 
IBOCM and the said rejects did not possess any c.v. having no carbon and only being 
stones/boulders. Therefore, the same had been used at the site for levelling, piling etc. 
for facilitation of smooth mining operations at the IBOCM.  
3.9.2 In the meantime, based on a Source Information Report33 pertaining to some 
irregularities committed in the allocation of coal blocks under the ‘Government 
Dispensation’ category, failure to follow the due procedure resulting in large private 
companies having connived with public servants and gaining undue benefit a 
Preliminary Inquiry34 was registered by the Superintendent of Police, CBI on 28th 
September, 2012. In all, three Preliminary Inquiries were registered namely, PE 2, PE 4

Though the appellants have asserted that the respondent-CBI has registered the 
complaint on coming across the Report of the CAG, the said submission has been 
refuted by the respondent-CBI who has pleaded that it had conducted an independent 
investigation after registering the PE which was followed by registering of the FIR. 
3.10 LITIGATION BETWEEN KPCL AND KECML 
3.10.1  
Aggrieved by the letter dated 31st July, 2014 addressed by KPCL to 
KECML, KECML filed two writ petitions37 before the High Court of Karnataka praying 
inter alia for quashing of the letters dated 31st July, 2014 and 24th December, 2014 
issued by KPCL. In the writ petitions38 EMTA and KECML assailed a demand of ₹ 
52,37,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty two crore thirty seven lakh only) raised by KPCL towards 
the value of the coal rejects, as arbitrary.  Challenge was also laid to the decision taken 
by  KPCL to deduct ₹ 90 (Rupees Ninety) per MT towards non-washing of coal, in terms 
of its communications dated 23rd November, 2013 and 29th January, 2014.  Vide 
Judgment dated 24th March, 2016 the Division Bench of the High Court allowed both 
the writ petitions39 and quashed the communications issued by KPCL to KECML. 
Further, KPCL was restrained from initiating any demand against KECML on the basis 
of the report of the CAG and called upon to reimburse the amounts already deducted 
by KPCL towards non-washing of coal.

3.10.2   
For the sake of completion of the narrative pertaining to the aforesaid 
litigation, it is pertinent to note that the aforesaid judgement dated 24th March, 2016, 
was challenged by KPCL before this Court by preferring Petitions for Special Leave to 
Appeal40. Vide Judgment dated 20th May, 2022, both the Civil Appeals41 were dismissed.  
 
3.10.3   
On 31st July 2017, the respondent-CBI submitted a request to the Ministry 
of Personnel Public Grievances and Pension42, Government of India for grant of 
sanction to prosecute Mr. Yogendra Tripathi (IAS), Managing Director, KPCL and Mr. 
R. Nagaraja, Director (Finance) of KPCL and nominee Director on the Board of KECML 
under Section 19 of the PC Act.  However, the Board of KPCL, which was the 
Sanctioning Authority, refused sanction for prosecution of Mr. R. Nagaraja by passing 
a detailed order. 
3.10.4  
After examining the order passed by the Board of KPCL refusing to grant 
sanction to prosecute Mr. R. Nagaraja, the Department of Personnel & Training43, 
Government of India addressed a letter dated 16th September, 2018 to the respondent–
CBI stating that the Competent Authority i.e., the Central Government had denied 
sanction for prosecution of   Mr. Yogendra Tripathi, the then Managing Director of KPCL. 
It is a matter of record that the respondent–CBI did not take any steps to challenge the 
decision taken by the Sanctioning Authority and the Competent Authority refusing 
 
40 Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (C) No. 26367-26370/2016

permission to grant sanction for the prosecution of Mr. R. Nagaraja and Mr. Yogendra 
Tripathi. 
3.10.5  
The Charge-sheet was finally filed by the respondent–CBI against 14 
persons/entities alleging that they had illegally disposed of the coal rejects in IBOCM.  
A Supplementary Chargesheet was filed on 4th November, 2019. Out of the two 
charges, one charge relating to allegations of recovery of payment for washing charges 
was dropped by the respondent-CBI. 
3.10.6  
On 1st September, 2021, the appellants filed an application before the 
learned Single Judge under Section 227 read with Section 239 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code44 for discharging them in the case.  By the common impugned order

ARGUMENTS BY COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANTS 
Following are the arguments advanced by Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned Senior Advocate 
appearing for the appellant No.1 and Mr. Abhimanyu Bhandari, learned counsel 
appearing for the appellant No.2 :- 
 
44 In short ‘Cr.P.C’ 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 34 of 101 
 
4.1 
That KPCL did not have any right over the rejects produced from the mine and 
therefore, cannot claim any entitlement thereto.  The terms and conditions stipulated in 
the JVA dated 13th September, 2002, in particular Articles 5(1)(b), 5(2)(b), 5(13) and 
6(3)(c) and Annexure I, when read together, would demonstrate that the obligation cast 
on the KECML was limited to providing KPCL specified quality of “washing coal” 
containing a guaranteed value and having a specified heat value and KECML was only 
required to dispose off the rejects to avoid any environmental hazards. 
4.2 
That the original Mining Plan which was submitted by KECML and was approved 
by the MoC in the year 2004, did not contain any specific provision relating to how the 
rejects were to be disposed off and nor did the allocation letter issued by the MoC to 
KPCL state anything in this regard.   For this, reliance has been placed on the reply 
furnished by the Minister of State, MoC, in the Lok Sabha in response to an unstarred 
question seeking an answer from the Government of India as to whether it had framed 
any National Policy for exploitation of coal rejects.  The reply furnished by the Minister 
was in the negative along with a clarification given that formulation of a policy of disposal 
of surplus coal, by-products and middling stock rejects from coal blocks was under the 
consideration of the Government. 
4.3 
Citing Clauses 5.2 and 5.2.2 of the FSA dated 09th May, 2007 and the definition 
clauses in respect of the expressions, “Purchaser” and “specified coal”, it has been 
urged that none of the clauses in the FSA have stated that KPCL would purchase or 
claim rights over the rejects and that KECML was to ensure that “shales/stones” are 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 35 of 101 
 
removed from the coal and the quality of coal meets the parameters indicated in 
Annexure I.   
4.4. 
To fortify the submission that KECML was only required to dispose off the coal 
rejects in an environment friendly manner and that KPCL would have no right over the 
rejects or claim any entitlement over them, reference has been made to the decision of 
the Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court in the case of KPCL v. Aryan Energy 
Private Limited45 and Others46 and the clause in the Agreement governing KPCL and 
AEPL to contend that it was similar to the present case inasmuch as like KECML, AEPL 
was also required to dispose off the rejects in a manner that would satisfy environmental 
regulations.  In the above case the Karnataka High Court has held that the clauses of 
the Agreement between the parties appearing before it showed that coal rejects were 
the property of AEPL and KPCL had no claim over it and that the term regarding 
disposal of coal rejects was imposed by KPCL only to ensure compliance of the 
environmental regulations. 
4.4.1. Notably, the aforesaid judgement of the High Court was challenged by KPCL 
before this Court by way of petition for special leave to appeal47. The said petition was 
disposed of by this Court on 26th April, 2024, noting that during the pendency of the 
petitions, the parties had settled their disputes amongst themselves and part of the 
decretal amount deposited by KPCL to discharge its liability towards supply of washed

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 36 of 101 
 
coal by AEPL along with interest etc. was directed to be released in favour of AEPL in 
terms of the Compromise Deed.  
4.5 
That  the Washability Report of CIMFR, Nagpur for the year 2009 had stated that 
the rejects had a GCV of 1094 Kcal/kg and less and therefore, the same could not have 
been utilized in the BTPS. For the said reason, KECML had used the rejects for captive 
consumption of the mine i.e. for levelling, piling etc. The very same Report was also 
referred to by KPCL in its reply to the audit objections raised by CAG to state that no 
loss has been caused to KPCL since the rejects were in the nature of stones and 
boulders and did not have useful heat value. 
4.6. 
To substantiate their submission that the rejects did not have the requisite GCV 
for being utilized in the BTPS, learned counsel have quoted a Circular issued by the 
NITI Aayog in the year 2020 which states that coal rejects having GCV of 1500 Kcal/kg 
are to be used in back filling of mines and can be used in construction of highways, 
roads etc. whereas rejects having GCV in the range of 1500 Kcal/kg to 2200 Kcal/Kg, 
can be used in FPC Boilers. 
4.7 
That at the time of filing the chargesheet on 04th January, 2018, the respondent-
CBI completely ignored the judgement dated 24th March, 2016 passed by the Karnataka 
High Court in the writ petition filed by the appellants against KPCL wherein it has been 
clearly held that KPCL does not have any right over the rejects generated during the 
process of mining and resultantly, the demand letter dated 31th July, 2014, issued by 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 37 of 101 
 
KPCL was set aside.  The said judgement has also been upheld by this Court vide 
judgement dated 20th May, 2022. 
4.8 
That KPCL has been blowing hot and cold.  First, it had filed objections to the 
quantification of coal rejects as recorded by the CAG in its Report but when its 
objections were rejected by the CAG, it changed its stand and proceeded to raise an 
illegal demand on the appellants on the basis of the very same CAG Report, which has 
been quashed by the High Court. 
4.9 
That both, the Karnataka High Court and this Court having quashed the 
demands made by KPCL in respect of the value of rejects to the tune of ₹ 52 Crore, no 
case has been made out by the respondent-CBI to prosecute the appellants particularly 
when on the advice of the Central Vigilance Commission48, the Central Government 
refused to grant sanction for the prosecution of Mr. Yogendra Tripathi (IAS), Managing 
Director, KPCL and Mr. R. Nagaraja, Director (Finance) of KPCL and nominee Director 
on the Board of KECML.  A different treatment cannot be meted out to the appellants. 
4.10. That the respondent-CBI has solely relied on the Report of the CAG of 2013 to 
launch its prosecution in the year 2015.  However, the Report of the CAG has not been 
approved by the Parliament in accordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 
19(A) and other provisions of the Comptroller and Auditor General's (Duties, Powers 
 
48 In short ‘CVC’ 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 38 of 101 
 
and Conditions of Service) Act, 197149 read with Articles 148 to 151 of the Constitution 
of India. 
4.11. That the analysis of the rejects and the manner in which loss was allegedly 
caused to KPCL, has primarily been arrived at by the respondent – CBI from the Report 
of the CAG and once this Court has held that the Report of CAG cannot be the basis 
for launching prosecution against the appellants, the entire basis of launching the 
prosecution is eroded.  
4.12. Stating that contrary to the prescribed procedure that contemplates that the 
Report of the CAG in relation to the accounts of a Government Company shall be 
submitted to the Government and the Central Government/State Government, as the 
case may be, shall place the said Report before each House of the Parliament/State 
Legislature and the Public Accounts Committee/the Joint Parliamentary Committee is 
required to scrutinize the said Report. In the instant case, the Report of the CAG has 
not been accepted either by the Public Accounts Committee or by the Committee of 
Public Undertakings  or by the Joint Parliamentary Committee nor has it been tabled 
before each House of the Parliament. It is only when the Report is tabled in the 
Parliament and duly scrutinized and the Government offers its view on the Report, can 
it form the basis for initiating any action.  Decisions in Centre for Public Interest 
Litigation v. Union of India50, Arun Kumar Aggarwal v. Union of India51 and Pathan 
 
49 In short ‘CAG Act’

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 39 of 101 
 
Mohammed Suleman Rehmatkhan v. State of Gujarat52 have been cited to bring 
home the argument that when the Report of the CAG is subject to scrutiny by the Public 
Accounts Committee/Joint Parliamentary Committee, it would not be proper to refer to 
its findings or the conclusions drawn therein. 
4.13. That the learned Special Judge, CBI has blindly accepted the charge levelled by 
the respondent-CBI quantifying the loss purportedly caused to KPCL on account of 
illegal sale of rejects at ₹49,03,54,159/- (Rupees Forty nine crore three lakh fifty four 
thousand one hundred and fifty nine only). The observations made in para 104 of the 
impugned judgement to the effect that the respondent-CBI has quantified the rejects on 
the basis of the documents of KECML and has calculated the loss on the basis of the 
rate of the lowest grade of coal prevailing at the relevant point of time is therefore, 
devoid of merits.  Reliance has been placed on the information in the Coal Directory of 
India published by the MoC for the year 2010-2011 that has categorized coal and coke 
and clarified that w.e.f. January, 2011, by virtue of a notification issued by the MoC, 
there has been a switchover from the existing Useful Heat Value53 based system of 
grading and pricing of non-coking coal produced in India to fully variable GCV system. 
4.13.1.    Under the JVA/FSA, KECML was required to supply Grade ‘D’ coal to KPCL.  
As per the Coal Directory of India, 2010-2011, Grade ‘D’ coal in terms of the old grades 
of non-coking coal would be equivalent to Grade ‘G-7’ and ‘G-8’ under the new grades 
 
52 (2014) 4 SCC 156 
53 In short UHV 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 40 of 101 
 
of non-coking coal. The GCV range in respect of Grade ‘G-7’ coal has been fixed 
between 5201 Kcal/kg and 5500 Kcal/kg and in respect of Grade ‘G-8’ coal, between 
4901 Kcal/kg and 5200 Kcal/kg. In the instant case, even as per the Report of the 
CIFMR, Nagpur, the coal rejects were found to be below either of the aforesaid grades 
of non-coking coal, having been pegged at a GCV of 1094 Kcal/kg. Therefore, it is 
contended that the chargesheet filed by the respondent-CBI quantifying the loss 
suffered by KPCL at ₹49,03,54,159/- (Rupees Forty nine crore three lakh fifty four 
thousand one hundred and fifty nine only), is without any basis and contrary to the 
records. 
4.14. That the Coal Controller did not raise any issue with regard to the disposal of the 
rejects and the respondent-CBI has neither made the Coal Controller a witness or an 
accused in the present case. 
4.15. The judgements in Radheshyam Kejriwal v. State of West Bengal and 
Another54; Ashoo Surendranath Tewari v. Deputy Superintendent of Police, EOW, 
CBI and Another55; J Sekar alias Sekar Reddy v. Directorate of Enforcement56; and 
Prem Raj v. Poonamma Menon & Another57 have been cited to argue that it is settled 
law that where a party has been exonerated on merits in civil adjudication, criminal 
 
54 (2011) 3 SCC 581 
55 (2020) 9 SCC 636

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 41 of 101 
 
prosecution cannot be permitted to continue on the same set of facts and 
circumstances. 
4.16. That the respondent – CBI has failed to produce any document to demonstrate 
that the accused Nos.1 to 5 had made any demand for illegal gratification or there was 
acceptance of any such demand made. In the absence of proof of demand and 
acceptance of illegal gratification by the public servant, no offence is made out under 
Section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act.  For this proposition, reliance has been placed on B. 
Jayaraj v State of Andhra Pradesh58; P. Satyanarayana Murthy v District Inspector 
of Police, State of Andhra Pradesh and Another59; State through Central Bureau 
of Investigation v Dr Anup Kumar Srivastava60; K. Shanthamma v State of 
Telangana61; Neeraj Dutta v State (NCT of Delhi)62; Soundarajan v State Rep. by 
the Inspector of Police Vigilance Anticorruption Dindigul63. 
4.17. Lastly, it has been strenuously argued that sanction to prosecute Mr. Yogendra 
Tripathi and Mr. R. Nagaraja64 having been denied by the Sanctioning Authority i.e. the 
Board of Directors of KPCL and the CVC and the said orders having been upheld by 
the DoPT and no steps having been taken by the respondent – CBI to challenge the 
 
58 (2014) 13 SCC 55 
59 (2015) 10 SCC 152 
60 (2017) 15 SCC 560

63 (2023) SCC OnLine SC 424 
64 (both of who were serving officers in KPCL at the relevant point of time) 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 42 of 101 
 
said decision, a different yardstick cannot be adopted in respect of the appellants.  The 
matter having attained finality, the appellants deserve to be discharged. 
5. 
ARGUMENTS BY COUNSEL FOR THE RESPONDENT-CBI 
5.1 
Mr. Cheema, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the respondent – CBI has 
refuted each and every argument advanced by learned counsel for the appellants. He 
submitted that the appellants have unduly placed heavy reliance on the fact that the 
original Mining Plan was approved by the MoC on 08th December, 2004 and the said 
Mining Plan did not contain any specific clause for disposal of rejects.  Similarly, 
unnecessary reference has been made by the appellants to Rule 22(5) of the Mineral 
Concession Rules, 1960 to demonstrate what information is required to be disclosed in 
a Mining Plan. It is submitted that the argument advanced by the appellants that in the 
absence of any stipulation in the Mining Plan regarding disposal of the rejects, there 
could be no inference of commission of any offence or a shadow cast on the conduct of 
the appellants, is flawed. 
5.2 
Learned counsel for the respondent-CBI has canvassed that there was a latent 
error in the assumption of the appellants that it was for the MoC to incorporate a clause 
regarding disposal of the rejects in the Mining Plan and in the absence of any such 
clause, KPCL or KECML could not be held responsible for the disposal of the rejects, 
which was done in an illegal manner or that when the Mining Plan was silent regarding 
the manner in which the rejects were to be disposed of, it was for KPCL and KECML to 
deal with the rejects in an appropriate manner. The aforesaid presumptions are stated 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 43 of 101 
 
to be without any basis and opposed to the letter dated 10th November, 2003, addressed 
by the MoC to KPCL that lays down the conditions of allotment of the captive coal blocks 
in para 3 that specifically states in sub-para (iv) as follows:  
“3 
The allotment of the captive blocks will also be subject to the 
following conditions:· 
xxxxx 
(iv) 
The allocattee would furnish to this Ministry detailed plan for 
disposal of unusable containing carbon material obtained during the 
process of a mining or any process thereafter including washing etc. so 
as to avoid any need for disposal of the same through sale etc. at a later 
stage, within 30 days of receipt of this letter or submission of mining plan 
whichever is earlier.”  
 
5.3 
As per the respondent-CBI, it was the duty of KPCL to furnish the detailed plan 
for the disposal of the rejects to the Ministry within 30 days of the receipt of the letter 
dated 10th November, 2003 or submission of the Mining Plan, whichever is earlier and 
this requirement was independent of the Mining Plan. Therefore, absence of any plans 
mentioned in the Mining Plan to deal with the rejects would not exonerate the appellants 
who remained under an obligation to furnish a detailed plan for the disposal of the 
rejects in terms of the Allocation letter dated 10th November, 2003 issued by the MoC. 
5.4 
Referring to the letter dated 31st January, 2006 addressed by the MoC to the 
Secretary, Industries, Energy and Labour Department, State of Maharashtra, learned 
counsel for the respondent-CBI submitted that the appellants were aware of the fact 
that the rejects could not have been disposed of by KECML since the said letter had 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 44 of 101 
 
conveyed the approval of the Central Government to grant mining lease for coal in three 
coal blocks in favour of KECML with certain stipulations, one of which was as follows: 
 
“ii)  
No coal mined from the allocated blocs shall be sold, 
delivered, transferred of disposed of except for the aforestated captive 
mining purposes except with the previous approval of the Central 
Government” 
 
5.5 
To reinforce the above plea, reliance has also been placed on the statement of 
Dr. Manmohan Seam, cited as witness No. 12 who had prepared the Mining Plan in 
question and stated that in case of washing of coal the allocatees are required to obtain 
an approval from the MoC in terms of the letter of allotment and since the MoC has not 
allocated any coal block for washing of coal alone, the expression used in para 3 (iii) of 
the letter dated 10th November, 2003 written by the MoC has to be read and understood 
to mean ‘washing-cum-end use’. Therefore, emphasis on non-incorporation of a 
detailed plan for the disposal of the rejects in the original Mining Plan has no relevance 
and cannot offer any defence to the appellants. 
5.6 
It has next been submitted that the order refusing grant of sanction to prosecute 
Mr. Yogendra Tripathi (IAS), Managing Director, KPCL and Mr. R. Nagaraja, Director 
(Finance) of KPCL and nominee Director on the Board of KECML by the Sanctioning 
Authority and the Competent Authority is not a relevant circumstance at the stage of 
consideration and framing of charge and no benefit can be given to the appellants on 
that basis.  The orders passed by the Competent Authority refusing to grant sanction 
are sought to be described as mere administrative orders.  Learned counsel argued that 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 45 of 101 
 
in any event, the two officers mentioned above were public servants and the factum of 
the Competent Authority having refused to grant sanction to prosecute them cannot 
enure to the benefit of the appellants herein who are not public servants and cannot 
seek any parity with public servants. 
5.7  
Learned counsel for the respondent-CBI points out that the Order on Charge 
impugned by the appellants herein was also challenged by the accused No. 1 to 5 
(functionaries of KPCL who had since retired), by filing a Petition for Special Leave to 
Appeal65 in this Court which was dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated 09th 
February, 2024. 
5.8 
 It is submitted that at the stage of framing of charges, the trial Court must confine 
itself to the material brought on record by way of the chargesheet filed under Section 
173 Cr.P.C and merely because some other Authority has taken a different view with 
regard to the complicity of some co-accused who are public servants and denied the 
request made by the respondent-CBI for sanctioning their prosecution, is irrelevant.  
5.9 
As for case law cited by learned counsel for the appellants to substantiate their 
submission that sanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C is mandatory for prosecuting public 
servants (A-1 to A-5 in the instant case), the submission made is that for the said 
purpose, facts and circumstances of each case have to be examined and there cannot 
be any universal findings in this regard.

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 46 of 101 
 
5.10 Learned counsel for the respondent – CBI has strenuously disputed as incorrect, 
the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants that the respondent – CBI has filed 
the Chargesheet solely on the basis of the CAG Report and submitted that a reading of 
the FIR dated 31st March, 2015 would demonstrate that this case was not triggered by 
the Report of the CAG. In fact, PE 5/2012 was registered on 28th September, 2012 in 
connection with the irregularities noticed in the allocation of coal blocks under the 
Government Dispensation route for the period between 1993 and 2006.Asserting that 
PE 5 did not emanate from the CAG Report and originated independently thereof, 
learned counsel submitted that during the course of the preliminary enquiry, several 
documents including the CAG Report were examined by the respondent – CBI. In fact, 
the respondent – CBI had conducted its own independent enquiry into the allegations 
for arriving at a conclusion relating to the commission of the offence or quantification of 
the extent of misappropriation. In view of the aforesaid submission, the contentions of 
the appellants based on a reading of the provisions of the CAG Act and the Constitution 
of India are stated to be extraneous to the controversy raised before this Court just as 
the case law cited by them regarding the nature of the CAG Report. Learned counsel 
has cited the judgment of the Gauhati High Court in M.S Associates and others v. 
Union of India66 to urge that even if the CAG Report has not been placed before the 
Parliament/State Legislature, contents thereof can serve as information for starting an 
investigation into a criminal offence.

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 47 of 101 
 
5.11 Coming next to the judgement passed by the Karnataka High Court in the case 
of Aryan Energy (supra) and cited by the other side, it is submitted on behalf of the 
respondent-CBI that the said judgment was passed on 22nd July, 2021, much after 
institution of the chargesheet by the respondent–CBI in the present case. Learned 
counsel submits that the said judgement addresses a situation where no criminal case 
has been registered against any of the parties appearing before the High Court. The 
main dispute in that matter was relating to the entitlement of KPCL to the value of the 
coal rejects. The Commercial Court had decreed the suits in favour of AEPL by holding 
that as per the contractual stipulations between the parties, AEPL was only required to 
dispose off the coal rejects in a manner that would satisfy environmental regulations 
and KPCL was not entitled to the value of the coal rejects.  Learned counsel submits 
that the terminology used in the contract governing the parties was different and 
therefore the said judgement does not have any relevance to the facts of the instant 
case. 
5.12 Learned counsel for the respondent-CBI goes on to argue that even the 
judgement dated 24th March, 2016, passed by the Karnataka High Court in a writ petition 
filed by KECML against KPCL cannot be of any assistance to the appellants for the 
reason that the respondent – CBI had not been impleaded as a party in the said 
proceedings and the said judgement has confined itself to the demands made by KPCL 
for recovery of amounts from KECML towards the value of the coal rejects. Further, the 
FIR in the present case was registered on 13th March, 2015 whereas the judgement 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 48 of 101 
 
was delivered by the Karnataka High Court one year later, on 24th March, 2016.  By the 
time the appeal preferred by KPCL against the judgment of the High Court was 
dismissed by this Court on 20th May, 2022, Charges had already been framed by the 
learned Special Judge, CBI against the appellants on 24th December, 2021.  
5.13 Learned counsel for the respondent–CBI has emphatically argued that Clause 
12 of the MoU dated 20th December, 2008 executed between KECML and GCWL states 
that the rejects shall be the joint property of KECML and GCWL and it shall be disposed 
of/sold jointly at mutually agreed terms. It is contended that the above clause clearly 
demonstrates the underlying intent of the appellants to conspire with GCWL to sell the 
rejects in the market and cause monetary loss to KPCL by depriving it of the value of 
the rejects. 
5.14 The attention of this Court has also been drawn to the letter dated 10th 
September, 2009, issued by KECML to GCWL enclosing therewith a Debit Note of even 
date for a sum of ₹ 4,30,38,500/- (Rupees Four crore thirty lakh thirty eight thousand 
five hundred only) towards “disposal of foreign material during washing” and it has been 
argued that the said Debit Note was raised on the instructions of Mr. Purujit Roy 
(accused No. 9), as stated by Mr. N.K. Ganorkar (PW 26) who was one of the two 
signatories of the said Debit Note and Mr. S.K. Gupta, an employee of GCWL (PW 16). 
5.15  Learned counsel for the respondent–CBI also referred to a Certificate dated 12th 
July, 2010 issued by Mr. Avijit Sarkar who was working in the Finance and Accounts 
Department of KECML. The said Certificate refers to the MoU dated 20th December, 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 49 of 101 
 
2008 and states that the rejects generated in the process of washing of coal undertaken 
by GCWL at their washery at Majiri during 2009-10, is owned by GCWL. 
5.16. Lastly, learned counsel for the respondent-CBI has canvassed that the findings 
returned in a civil proceeding are not binding in a prosecution founded on similar 
allegations and it is for the criminal Court to arrive at any decision on its own and not to 
reach any conclusion by reference to any previous decisions relating to the parties 
which cannot be treated as binding upon it. In support of the said submission, he has 
cited The King Emperor v. Khawaja Nazir Ahmed67. It has thus been argued by the 
respondent-CBI that the present appeals are devoid of merits and deserve to be 
dismissed.   
5.17. On the scope of Section 227, Cr.P.C. and the power of the Special Judge to 
pass an order of discharge, learned counsel for the respondent-CBI has cited the 
decisions in Union of India v. Prafulla Kumar Samal and Another68 and Niranjan 
Singh Karam Singh v. Jitendra Bhimraj Bijjaya And Others69. The decisions in 
State of Maharashtra v. Som Nath Thapa70, State of Tamil Nadu v. N. Suresh Rajan 
and Others71 have been relied on to make a point that at the stage of framing of 
charges, the Court cannot appraise the evidence as is done at the time of trial and the 
Court must proceed on an assumption that the materials brought on record by the 
 
67 AIR (1945) PC 18 
68 (1979) 3 SCC 4 
69 (1990) 4 SCC 76 
70 (1996) 4 SCC 659 
71 (2014) 11 SCC 709 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 50 of 101 
 
prosecution are true. Alluding to the judgment in State of Bihar v. Ramesh Singh72, 
learned counsel submitted that at the initial stage of the trial, if there is a strong 
suspicion that gives an impression to the Court for drawing a presumption that the 
accused has committed an offence, it is not open for the Court to state that there is 
insufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.  
5.18 Both sides have also relied on K.G. Premshanker v. Inspector of Police and 
Another73 which discusses the effect of a decision of a civil Court on criminal 
proceedings against the same person pertaining to the same cause in the context of 
Sections 40 to 43 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 as to which judgments of the courts 
are relevant and the extent of the relevance.

REJOINDER ARGUMENTS BY COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANTS 
In their rejoinder arguments, learned counsel for the appellants have disputed the 
submissions made on behalf of the respondent-CBI and reiterated the pleas taken by 
them. We do not propose to repeat the said submissions except for touching on the 
aspects which were not addressed earlier. 
6.1 
It has been stated that the MoU dated 20th December, 2008 was executed to 
meet the urgent requirement of coal for BTPS. The purpose of incorporating Clause 12 
was to keep a check on the rejects generated by GCWL during the washing of coal. The 
said clause specifically mentions that any disposal/sale of the rejects would be subject 
 
72 (1977) 4 SCC 39 
73 (2002) 8 SCC 87 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 51 of 101 
 
to compliances of the relevant rules and regulations. Learned counsel submitted that it 
is the case of the respondent-CBI itself that GCWL sold the rejects by mixing it with 
good coal at their washery.  There is no document produced by the respondent-CBI to 
connect the rejects sold by GCWL to the appellants.  The appellants cannot be roped 
in on the bald statements made by the functionaries of GCWL connecting them with the 
coal purchased in e-auction from WCL and sold off.  
6.2  
As for the Debit Note dated 21st March, 2009, it is submitted that the same was 
recovered from GCWL and not KECML.  The said Debit Note was neither acted upon 
nor approved by the Board of Directors of KECML and there is no supporting 
correspondence relating to the Debit Note to demonstrate any complicity on the part of 
the appellants. 
6.3 
 The appellants have disputed the Certificate dated 12th July, 2010, purportedly 
issued by Mr. Avijit Sarkar to GCWL stating that the email was despatched by the said 
employee from his personal email id and not from the official email id of KECML and he 
was not authorized by the Board of Directors of KECML to issue any such email.  Even 
otherwise, the Certificate runs contrary to Clause 12 of the MoU, as it purports to give 
100% entitlement of the rejects to GCWL. 
6.4 
 During the course of rejoining, arguments have also been advanced on the 
quantum of the rejects which as per the appellants, has been wrongly quantified by the 
respondent–CBI at 8,03,859.277 MT. Learned counsel contended that the said figure 
has been pulled out by the respondent-CBI from the CAG Report though it claims it has 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 52 of 101 
 
not relied on it to register the PE, followed by registration of the FIR.   The attention of 
this Court has been drawn to the mismatch between the quantity of rejects for a period 
of two months (April and May of the year, 2012-13) claimed to be 207,837.117 MT by 
referring to a Certificate dated 07th June, 2016 issued by Mr. S.N. Roy, Statutory Auditor 
of KECML vis-à-vis the quantity of rejects generated for a period of twelve months for 
the previous year (2011-2012) that came to only 74,511.709 MT.  Learned counsel 
submitted that in reply to the Audit query raised by the CAG, KECML had specifically 
stated that the total production of coal upto May, 2012 was 79,46,082.736 MT which 
included coal and rejects. This figure has not been disputed by the respondent – CBI. 
The quantity of the rejects upto May, 2012 was 75,63,934.800 MT of the washed coal 
which figure has also not been disputed by the respondent-CBI.  An inference would 
therefore have to be drawn that, at best, the difference between both the aforesaid 
figures would be the extent of the rejects of coal.  It has been urged that once the extent 
of production and the quantum of coal sent to KPCL has not been disputed, there is no 
question of inflating the quantum of rejects, as alleged. The respondent–CBI has 
therefore blindly accepted the version put forth by GCWL that it had supplied good coal 
to KPCL from its own pocket, which suits its purpose because when the washing activity 
was stopped at Majri on 22nd May, 2012, disputes had arisen between KECML and 
GCWL, that are pending adjudication before the Arbitration Tribunal and GCWL has 
inflated its claims to raise exorbitant demands on KECML.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 53 of 101 
 
7.1 
We have given our anxious consideration to the arguments advanced by learned 
counsel for the parties, gone through the records and perused the impugned orders.  
The grievance of the appellants arises from the decision taken by the learned Special 
Judge, CBI to reject the application moved by them for seeking discharge in the matter 
and proceeding to frame charges against them alongwith the other co-accused for 
having entered into a criminal conspiracy with an object to facilitate illegal sale of coal 
rejects by GCWL that were generated during washing of coal and to have gained undue 
pecuniary advantage therefrom. 
7.2 
The genesis of the investigation conducted by the respondent–CBI in respect of 
the coal block allocation lies in the judgement of this Court dated 25th August 2014 
rendered in Manohar Lal Sharma vs. Principal Secretary and Another74.  The 
petitioner therein filed a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India and 
challenged the allocation of coal blocks to Private Companies for the period between 
1993 and 2011 on the ground that they violated the principles of trusteeship of natural 
resources by giving away precious resources as largesse without complying with the 
mandatory provisions of the MMDR Act and 1973 Coal Act.  After a detailed scrutiny, 
this Court declared that the entire allocation of coal blocks as per the recommendations 
made by the Screening Committee from the year 1993 onwards through the 
Government dispensation route suffered from arbitrariness, and that no fair and 
transparent procedure had been adopted. 
 
74 (2014) 9 SCC 516 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 54 of 101 
 
7.3 
In the course of the proceedings in the aforesaid matter, the respondent–CBI 
registered a Preliminary inquiry to investigate the irregularities in allocation of coal 
blocks under the Government Dispensation Route and to State PSUs, who were 
allowed to form JVA by joining hands with Private Companies for purposes of 
development and operation of coal mines.  PE 5 was registered on 28th September, 
2012. It related to all the coal block allocations made during the year 1993 to 2006.  It 
is not in dispute that the coal allocation in favour of KPCL was also a subject matter of 
investigation, but nothing untoward was noticed in that. The JVA between KPCL and 
KECML also withstood the test of scrutiny.  As a result, allocation of coal blocks made 
in favour of KPCL were not interfered with. 
 
 
8. 
DID CBI PRIMARILY RELY ON THE AUDIT REPORT OF THE CAG ? 
8.1 
We shall first examine the submission made by the appellants that the 
respondent–CBI solely relied on the Audit report of the CAG of 2013 to launch its 
prosecution in the year 2015. This contention has been strongly refuted by the 
respondent–CBI that has asserted that the Department had on its own initiative, come 
across several documents including the CAG Report which exposed commission of the 
offence and the extent of misappropriation of money by the appellants and the other co-
accused and it had not solely relied on the CAG Report to commence the investigation. 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 55 of 101 
 
8.2 
In the course of hearing, this Court had directed learned counsel for the 
respondent–CBI to produce the files of the Department on the basis whereof, three 
Preliminary Inquiries were registered – PE-2/2012/EO-I75, PE-4/2012/EO-I76 and PE-
5/2012/EO-I77.  It transpires from the said records that PE-2 was registered on 02nd 
June, 2012 on the directions issued by the CVC that had forwarded a complaint received 
by it alleging irregularities in the allotment of coal blocks to Private Companies during 
the period 2006 to 2009 and in awarding a contract by State owned PSUs for the 
development of coal blocks allocated to them under the Government dispensation.  
Subsequently, two more references were received by the respondent–CBI from the 
CVC and vide OM dated 19th September, 2012, the CVC forwarded a third complaint 
received from seven Members of Parliament (Lok Sabha) and directed the respondent 
– CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry. 
8.3 
The file produced by the respondent–CBI reveals that premised on the Source 
Information Report78 submitted by an Inspector from the Department pertaining to some 
irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks under the Government Dispensation 
Category allegedly in connivance with public servants, the matter was taken up by CBI 
for verification.  The notings in the file states that it was not possible to verify the 
allegations discretely.  Therefore, the SIR was directed to be registered as a PE.  These 
records falsifies the suggestion made by the respondent–CBI that there was a SIR that 
 
75 In short PE-2 
76 In short PE-3 
77 In short PE-4 
78 For short ‘SIR’ 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 56 of 101 
 
disclosed irregularities in the JVA executed between KPCL and KECML.  The stand of 
the respondent – CBI that PE-5 was registered well before the Audit Report of the CAG 
and originated independently thereof, is also factually misleading because CBI’s own 
record shows that the scope of enquiry in respect of PE-5 registered on 28th September, 
2012, was entirely different and had no relationship with the JVA and other agreements 
executed by KPCL and KECML.  No other documents have been filed by the respondent 
– CBI to demonstrate that it had initiated an independent inquiry into the mining 
operations of KPCL or that it was during the course of its inquiry into the affairs of KPCL 
and KECML that it had stumbled upon some irregularities in the MoU executed between 
KECML with GCWL.  Quite clearly, the respondent–CBI made the Audit Report of the 
CAG submitted in 2013, a launching pad for initiating the prosecution of the appellants 
in respect of the allegations levelled in the present case and subsequently sought to 
substantiate them by delving into the records maintained by KPCL, KECML and GCWL.  
In other words, there was no move within the Department to investigate KPCL or 
KECML before 2015.  The PE’s registered in the year 2012 did not inculpate the 
appellants in any manner.  The entire focus of the said PE’s was on the larger issue of 
irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks through the Government dispensation route. 
In this background, the respondent–CBI cannot be heard to state that CBI was 
independently investigating the matter at hand well before 2015 or the Audit Report of 
the CAG of 2013 was not the trigger point for commencing the investigation. 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 57 of 101 
 
9. 
COULD THE AUDIT REPORT OF THE CAG FASTEN ANY LIABILITY ON 
KECML? 
9.1 
Coming next to the CAG Report, as much hinges on the said Report, we may 
note that the same was considered by the Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka 
in its judgement dated 24th March, 2016, wherein, it was noticed that there was no 
dispute between KPCL and KECML regarding the obligations cast on them under the 
contracts for the development of captive coal blocks and for supply of coal for 
consumption at the Thermal Power Station (BPCL) located in the State of Karnataka 
until the CAG submitted an Audit Report for the year ending March, 2013. The High 
Court took note of the Report of the CAG which stated that the total production of coal 
from one of the open cast mines between 2008-09 and June 2012 was 80.78 lacs MT 
and a minimum quantity of coal rejects ought to be 10% of the total production which 
would come to 8.28 lacs MT which financially translated into ₹52,37,00,000/- (Rupees 
Fifty Two Crores Thirty Seven Lacs only).  Based on the above analysis, the CAG raised 
an audit objection and called upon KPCL to explain the loss of ₹52,37,00,000/- (Rupees 
Fifty Two Crores Thirty Seven Lacs only) allegedly caused to the public exchequer, on 
account of the rejects being disposed of in terms of a MoU executed between KECML 
and GCWL.  The stand taken by KPCL was also noted by the court.  KPCL submitted 
its Audit Objections to the said Report stating inter alia that the valuation of the rejects 
was erroneous; that assessment of washery rejects did not have any co-relation with 
the quantity of coal produced at the open coal mines; that the rejects generated in the 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 58 of 101 
 
mining operation were only stones and boulders and could not be used for generation 
of electricity at BPCL and lastly, that all the rejects were used for levelling and piling 
work within the mines for better mining operations. However, all the said objections were 
rejected by the CAG that maintained its stand in the final Report. 
9.2 
The High Court observed that at that stage, KPCL did a sudden summersault.  
Faced with the Audit Report of the CAG, KPCL proceeded to raise a demand on the 
appellants seeking reimbursement to the tune of ₹52,37,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty two 
crores thirty seven lacs only) as cost of the rejects and threatened KECML that in case 
of default of payment, recovery would commence from their running bills.  This made 
KECML file two writ petitions, which were allowed by the High Court with the following 
observations: 
xxxxxxx 
“36. 
We find that the report of CAG cannot be the sole basis for any 
liability being caused or for that matter the sole basis for the prosecution to 
be launched.  However, mere drawing up of FIR by the CBI against unknown 
officials of KPCL, EMTA and KEMTA cannot provide legal basis or impetus 
for unilateral demand by KPCL for recovery of ₹52,37,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty 
Two Crores Thirty Seven Lakh) only.  We hold that such action is arbitrary 
and unsustainable in law.” 
 
9.3. 
The aforesaid judgement was assailed by KPCL by approaching this Court.  The 
said appeals were dismissed by a three Judges Bench of this Court of which one of us 
(Hon’ble Ms. Hima Kohli, J) was a member with the observations that the Audit Report 
of the CAG appeared to have been the starting point for the entire dispute between the 
parties. When the CAG Report was first submitted, KPCL had itself raised objections to 
the quantification of the coal rejects by the CAG but on its objections being turned down, 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 59 of 101 
 
KPCL raised a demand on KECML seeking reimbursement on the basis of very same 
CAG Report to which it had not so long ago, filed objections. 
9.4. 
 
The observations made by this Court in the captioned decision are 
germane and are extracted below: 
“13. 
The present matter pertains to a tender that was awarded by the 
appellant to EMTA nearly twenty years ago, in the year 2002. The CAG 
report that appears to have been the starting point for the entire dispute 
between the parties is dated March, 2013, close to a decade back. In 
such circumstances, to even advert to arguments on the maintainability 
of the writ petitions would be unjust to the parties involved. 
14 Coming to the merits of the appeal, from the facts, it appears that in 
the first instance, when the CAG report was first submitted, the appellant 
itself had raised objections to the quantification of coal rejects arrived at 
by the CAG. However, when the audit objections were rejected by the 
CAG, and the final report was made available, the appellant demanded 
reimbursement from KEMTA based on the same CAG report to which it 
had filed objections. Such a change of stand by the appellant has not 
been sufficiently explained. 
15 Additionally, a bare perusal of the clauses contained in the various 
agreements entered into between the parties does not indicate that such 
deductions could be made for the purposes of washing charges. There 
does not appear to be any specification laid down as to the method 
required to be adopted for washing of coal. 
16 No material has been placed on record by the appellant to suggest 
that there was ever any problem with respect to the quality of coal being 
supplied by KEMTA to the appellant. Rather, the impugned order 
suggests that coal supplied by KEMTA was utilized by the appellant in its 
thermal power plants in order to generate electricity. 
17 Taking into consideration the above facts and circumstances, we are 
of the opinion that no material has been brought to the notice of this Court 
that would compel us to interfere with the impugned common judgment 
passed by the High Court in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 136 
of the Constitution.  
18 Accordingly, the Civil Appeals filed by the appellant are dismissed.” 
 
9.5. 
We are therefore of the opinion that this Court having already dismissed the 
appeal filed by KPCL against the judgment of the Karnataka High Court, having held in 
clear terms that the CAG Report could not form the basis for launching proceedings 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 60 of 101 
 
against the appellants and further, having upheld the findings returned by the Karnataka 
High Court that the CAG Report appears to have been the starting point for the entire 
disputes between the parties who till then, were smoothly discharging their obligations 
under various agreements, there is no reason to take a different view only on the ground 
that the respondent–CBI was not a party in the aforesaid proceedings. The chronology 
of the events speak for themselves and need no further elaboration.  
10 
IMPORT OF THE JUDGMENT DATED 24TH MARCH, 2016 OF THE 
KARNATAKA HIGH COURT  
10.1. Coming next to the submission made by learned counsel for the respondent that 
the judgement dated 24th March, 2016 passed by the Karnataka High Court in a writ 
petition filed by KECML against KPCL is of no consequence, as the said judgment was 
confined to examining the demands made by KPCL on KECML for reimbursement 
towards the value of the coal rejects, the same is found to be erroneous.  It is well-
settled that in a case of exoneration on merits in relation to adjudication proceedings in 
a civil matter where the allegations are found to be unsustainable and the party is held 
as innocent, criminal prosecution on the same set of facts and circumstances cannot 
be permitted to continue. In Radheshyam Kejriwal(supra), a three judges Bench of 
this Court reconciled the conflict between the view taken in Standard Chartered 
Bank(1) v. Directorate of Enforcement79 and Collector of Customs v. L.R. 
Melwani80 on the one hand where it was held that adjudication proceedings and 
 
79 (2006) 4 SCC 278  
80 AIR 1970 SC 962 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 61 of 101 
 
criminal proceedings are two independent proceedings and both can go on 
simultaneously and findings in the adjudication proceedings is not binding on the 
criminal proceedings and the judgments in Uttam Chand v. ITO81, G.L. Didwania v. 
ITO82, K.C. Builders v. CIT83 where the view taken was that when there is a categorical 
finding in the adjudication proceedings exonerating a person which is binding and 
conclusive, the prosecution cannot be allowed to stand, this Court summarized the ratio 
of the decisions in the following words: 
“38. The ratio which can be culled out from these decisions can broadly be stated 
as follows: 
(i) Adjudication proceedings and criminal prosecution can be launched 
simultaneously; 
(ii) Decision in adjudication proceedings is not necessary before initiating criminal 
prosecution; 
(iii) Adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings are independent in nature 
to each other; 
(iv) The finding against the person facing prosecution in the adjudication 
proceedings is not binding on the proceeding for criminal prosecution; 
(v) Adjudication proceedings by the Enforcement Directorate is not prosecution 
by a competent court of law to attract the provisions of Article 20(2) of the 
Constitution or Section 300 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; 
(vi) The finding in the adjudication proceedings in favour of the person facing trial 
for identical violation will depend upon the nature of finding. If the exoneration in 
adjudication proceedings is on technical ground and not on merit, prosecution 
may continue; and 
(vii) In case of exoneration, however, on merits where the allegation is found to 
be not sustainable at all and the person held innocent, criminal prosecution on the 
same set of facts and circumstances cannot be allowed to continue, the 
underlying principle being the higher standard of proof in criminal cases. 
 
39. In our opinion, therefore, the yardstick would be to judge as to whether 
the allegation in the adjudication proceedings as well as the proceeding for 
prosecution is identical and the exoneration of the person concerned in the 
adjudication proceedings is on merits. In case it is found on merit that there 
is no contravention of the provisions of the Act in the adjudication 
proceedings, the trial of the person concerned shall be an abuse of the 
process of the court.”

      [emphasis added] 
The aforesaid view also finds resonance in Ashoo Surendranath Tewari (supra) and 
J Sekar alias Sekar Reddy(supra). 
10.2. We are of the view that if there was any breach of contract or default on the part 
of KECML, KPCL was well empowered to determine the lease. However, KPCL did not 
do so. Instead, on being confronted with the Audit Objections taken by CAG, it raised 
a demand on KECML for the value of the coal rejects. This demand was quashed and 
set aside by the Karnataka High Court and this Court.  
10.3. On applying the decisions cited above to the facts of the instant case, this Court 
cannot turn a blind eye to the view taken in the judgement dated 24th March, 2016 
passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka in a dispute directly arising 
between KPCL and KECML pertaining to the very same cause of action based on the 
obligations cast on both the parties under various agreements executed for the 
development of captive coal blocks and for supply of coal, which was finally upheld by 
this Court vide judgement dated 20th May, 2022. The said judgments have cleared 
KECML of any blame. On the same set of facts and logic, we are of the opinion that no 
criminality can be attributed to the appellants.   
   
11. 
SANCTITY OF AN AUDIT REPORT IN LAW  
11.1. As the sanctity of the Audit Report of the CAG of 2013 has been questioned by 
the appellants, we propose to examine this aspect. Before the year 1971, the CAG 
used to function under the Government of India (Audit and Accounts Order), 1936 as 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 63 of 101 
 
adopted by the Government of India (Provisional Constitution) Order, 1947. This was 
followed by the promulgation of the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (Duties, Powers 
and Conditions of Service) Act, 197184.  By virtue of Section 26 of the CAG Act, the 
earlier Order of 1936 was repealed.  Section 10 of the CAG Act requires the CAG to 
compile the accounts of the Union and the States and on the basis of the said accounts, 
to prepare an annual account for being submitted to the President of India or the 
Governor of the State/Administrator of the Union Territory, as the case may be. The 
scope of the audit of the Union and the States has been stated in Section 13 of the 
CAG Act. 
11.2. Article 149 of the Constitution of India defines the duties and powers of the CAG 
and provides thus: 
 
“149. Duties and powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General 
The Comptroller and Auditor-General shall perform such duties and exercise such 
powers in relation to the “accounts of the Union and of the States and of any other 
authority or body as may be prescribed by or under any law made by Parliament and, 
until provision in that behalf is so made, shall perform such duties and exercise such 
powers in relation to the accounts of the Union and of the States as were conferred 
on or exercisable by the Auditor-General of India immediately before the 
commencement of this Constitution in relation to the accounts of the Dominion of 
India and of the Provinces respectively.” 
 
 
11.3 
The duties of the CAG have been described and discussed at some length in 
the Arun Kumar Aggarwal(supra)  in the following words: 
“60. The audit of the Union and the States is under Section 13 of the 
Act. The scope of the audit extends to the audit of all expenditure so as 
to ascertain whether the monies shown in the accounts as having been 
 
84 For short ‘the CAG Act’ 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 64 of 101 
 
disbursed were legally available for such disbursement and whether the 
expenditure conforms to the authority which governs it. The CAG has to 
satisfy himself that the rules and procedures designed to secure an 
effective check on the assessment, collection and proper allocation of 
revenue are being duly observed under Section 16. The CAG also has 
to examine decisions which have financial implications including the 
propriety of the decision making. 
61. The reports of the CAG are required to be submitted to the 
President, who shall cause them to be laid before each House of 
Parliament, as provided under Article 151(1). In relation to the States, 
reports are submitted to the Governor, who shall cause them to be laid 
before the legislature of the State, as per Article 151(2) of the 
Constitution. When reports are received in Parliament, they are 
scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). 
62. The PAC is established in accordance with Rule 308 of the Rules of 
Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha. The function of the 
PAC is to examine the accounts of the Union and the report of the CAG. 
The PAC shall be principally concerned whether the policy is carried out 
efficiently, effectively and economically, rather than with the merits of 
government policy. Its main functions are to see that public monies are 
applied for the purposes prescribed by Parliament, that extravagance 
and waste are minimised and that sound financial practices are 
encouraged in estimating and contracting, and in administration 
generally. The PAC also has the power to receive evidence, the power 
to send for persons, papers and record and can receive oral evidence 
on solemn affirmation. Once the report is prepared, the report of the PAC 
is presented to the House. 
xxxxx 
68. We may, however, point out that since the report is from a 
constitutional functionary, it commands respect and cannot be 
brushed aside as such, but it is equally important to examine the 
comments what respective Ministries have to offer on the CAG’s 
Report. The Ministry can always point out, if there is any mistake 
in the CAG’s report or the CAG has inappropriately appreciated the 
various issues. For instance, we cannot as such accept the CAG 
report in the instant case.” 
[ emphasis added ] 
 
A similar view has been expressed in Pathan Mohammed Suleman 
Rehmatkhan(supra) and Centre for Public Interest Litigation(supra). 
11.4. It is, therefore, evident that the recommendations of the PAC are premised on 
the response that is received from the concerned Ministries and the Action Taken 
Reports which includes the replies furnished by the Government and the comments of 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 65 of 101 
 
the PAC to the said replies. Finally, it is for the Parliament to comment on the CAG’s 
Report after it receives the report of the PAC. 
11.5.  In the instant case, admittedly the aforesaid procedure has not been followed.  
As noticed above, the CAG Report is subject to scrutiny by the Parliament and the 
Government can always offer its views on the said report. Merely because the CAG is 
an independent constitutional functionary does not mean that after receiving a report 
from it and on the PAC scrutinizing the same and submitting its report, the Parliament 
will automatically accept the said report.  The Parliament may agree or disagree with 
the Report.  It may accept it as it is or in part.  It is not in dispute that the Audit Report 
of the CAG has not been tabled before the Parliament for soliciting any comments from 
the PAC or the respective Ministries. Therefore, the views taken by the CAG to the 
effect that tremendous loss had been caused to the public exchequer on account of the 
coal rejects being disposed of by the KPCL and KECML remains a view point but cannot 
be accepted as decisive. The respondent–CBI has largely relied on the findings and 
the conclusions drawn in the Audit Report of the CAG to launch the prosecution against 
the appellants on an assumption that the said Report has the seal of approval of the 
Parliament and has attained finality, which is not the case.

DENIAL OF SANCTIONS BY THE SANCTIONING AUTHORITIES AND THE 
EFFECT ON THE APPELLANTS 
 
12.1. It is relevant to note that the very same Audit objections taken by the CAG and 
relied upon by the respondent–CBI to allege conspiracy and loss to the public 
exchequer were thoroughly examined and found to be meritless by two separate set of 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024

Sanctioning Authorities. When it came to Mr. R. Nagaraja, the then Director (Finance) 
of KPCL and the nominee Director on the Board of KECML, the Sanctioning Authority, 
i.e., the Board of KPCL went through several documents during its deliberations 
including the MoU between the KECML and GCWL forwarded by the respondent–CBI 
for seeking sanction to prosecute him. The reasons for holding that the CAG Report 
was without any factual basis, were elaborately dealt with as below :   
 
“DETAILED REPORT OF THE BOARD OF KPCL IN RELATION TO 
THE CBI REPORT DATED 28.07.2017 AS REGARDS SHRI R. 
NAGARAJA 
xxxxx 
1.8 
There is an Memorandum of Understanding dated 20.12.2008 
between Gupta Coal Fields and Washeries Ltd (‘GCWL’) and KECML 
under which GCWL was required to wash and supply the coal of required 
specification to the Power Plant of KPCL in respect of coal mined by 
KECML.  Clause 12 of the said MoU stipulates that “the rejects generated 
shall be the joint property of KECML and GCWL and can be disposed off 
/ sold at mutually agreed terms subject to compliance of rules / 
regulations / guidelines of Ministry of Coal, Government of India, if 
applicable”.  KPCL allowed KECML to sign an MoU with Gupta under 
which rejects belonging to KPCL was put under the joint ownership of 
Gupta and KECML by virtue of Clause 12.  Gupta has sold those rejects 
resulting in an illegal gain of Rs.52.37 crores to Gupta (as per CAG) and 
loss to KPCL.  The Board of KECML which conspired to insert Clause 12 
of the MoU did not take any protective / mitigative measures to prevent 
the loss despite it being raised at a lower level.  The facts in relation to 
the above offence are elaborated in detail herein below. 
xxxxx 
B. 
Consideration of the report of CBI dated 27.07.2017 (along 
with annexures) by the Board of KPCL and their Report thereon 
2. 
The entire matter including the 344 documents produced along 
with the Report and the witness statements of 67 witnesses have been 
perused by the members of the Board.  The Board has also considered 
the applicable law on the point. 
3. 
The offence is complained of by Shri R. Nagaraja in his capacity 
as a nominee of KPCL in the Board of KECML.  It is the matter of fact 
that the nominees of KPCL who have been appointed to the Board of 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 67 of 101 
 
KECML are not persons well versed in mining matters.  As KPCL was not 
capable of handling mining operations, a joint Venture Company was 
formed.  The Board of KECML and the nominees of KPCL on the Board 
entirely depended on the inputs provided by the Managing Director, 
Statutory Auditor and other personnel for making their decisions. 
4. 
The Mining Plan for the operationalization of the mine was 
prepared by Dr. Seam who was a Ministry of Coal official and not an 
employee of KECML or KPCL.  The Mining Plan was approved by 
the Ministry of Coal when it did not contain any provisions for 
disposal of the rejects.  In such a situation, the Board of Directors 
of KECML and especially the KPCL nominees (A-1 to A-7) could not 
be blamed for the non-compliance of the Allotment Letter and there 
is no act of omission or commission on the part of KPCL’s 
employees including Shri R. Nagaraja. 
5. 
A perusal of the KPCL Office Notes (Document No.199 to 202) 
for the period indicates that by way of letter dated 12.01.2009, the 
Managing Director of KPCL had specifically raised the issue of whether 
washing of coal is required or not.  If washing was not necessary, then 
the question of generation of rejects would not arise at all.  Therefore, 
after taking into account the office note generated by Shri Purushottam, 
Shri R. Nagaraja had sought to examine whether washing is required at 
all.  Hence, Shri R. Nagaraja has acted with great prudence to ensure 
that no loss is caused to KPCL under the directions of Dr. S.M. Jaamdar, 
MD, KPCL. 
6. 
If washing of coal was not required, then the MoU with Gupta 
was not required to be approved inasmuch as the main purpose of the 
agreement was to start the washing process.  Although the MoU was 
ratified, it could not be operationalized specifically Clause 12 of the MoU 
was not ratified by the Board of KECML.  Conditional ratification of MoU 
does not mean that the Board has dishonestly refrained from protecting 
the interest of KPCL.  (See Board minutes of KECML at Document 
No.232) 
7. 
From the reading of the Clause 12, it appears that the fact 
that there was no concluded contract vis-à-vis of rejects inasmuch 
it was understood that it was to be sold on ‘mutually agreed terms’ 
and ‘subject to legal clearances’.  This implies that GCWL and 
KECML had to mutually agree for the terms of the sale and same 
had to be approved by Ministry of Coal.  Given the fact that the MoU 
was only conditionally ratified, it was incumbent upon the officials of 
KECML that before they agree to any terms for the sale of the rejects that 
they had to bring the matter up to the Board of KECML.  The subsequent 
events indicate that even the officials of KECML were of the same 
understanding. 
8. 
Even assuming that the Clause 12 of the MoU was 
approved, another aspect of the matter which has to be noted is that 
Clause 12 of the MoU does not violate the terms of the Allotment 
Letter inasmuch as it specifically required that the approval of the 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 68 of 101 
 
Ministry of Coal be obtained before such a disposal.  A bare reading 
of the Clause 12 does not indicate any illegality a sought to be 
alleged by the CBI.  Therefore, the approval of the MoU in the Board 
Meeting on 13.01.2009 cannot be said to be an act of negligence or error 
in judgment and no imputation of any wrongdoing can be imposed any 
KPCL nominee present in the Board Meeting on 13.01.2009. 
xxxxx 
10. 
Additionally, KECML wrote a letter wherein it sought for a 
waiver from meeting the specification if raw coal was supplied.  The 
difficulty for the Management of KPCL was that if the raw coal did 
not match the specification, it would not be utilization for the 
generation of power.  This would result in stoppage of generation 
resulting in power crisis in the State of Karnataka.  The better 
alternative would have been to wait for the certificate of the Coal 
Controller regarding whether the raw coal met the requirements of KPCL 
of not.  Hence, no confirmation was given.  This was a managerial 
decision taken in the best interest of the State of Karnataka as the power 
generation could not be compromised to save washing cost.  The cost 
of procurement of power would be tremendous and outweighed any 
temporary disadvantage caused by not abiding by the Board 
Minutes of 13.06.2009.  This decision was vindicated by the letter 
issued by the Coal Controller’s Office on 09.12.2009 wherein it 
concluded that to obtain the agreed parameter of coal quality, 
washing would be required.  Therefore, it cannot be said that there 
was an act of omission or negligence or error in judgment on part 
of the KPCL nominees on the Board of KECML.  The decision was 
taken keeping the best interests of KPCL in mind and cannot be 
faulted. 
xxxxx 
16. 
The contention of CBI that there is a violation of the allotment 
order that tailings and rejects are the property of KPCL and should be 
utilized only for its end use of power generation appears to be based on 
a strict interpretation of the allotment conditions.  Technically, Bellary 
Thermal Plant of 500 MW capacity is designed to use pulverized coal for 
firing and coal of reasonable quality.  As such the condition that 
middlings, tailings & rejects should be used for power generation 
by KPCL is neither feasible nor appropriate.  On the other hand, 
since disposal of rejects is an environmental issue, KPCL has 
insisted that the same should be subject to compliance of 
environmental norms.  When KPCL was not in a position to use the 
reject for power generation, the onus is on the mining operator to 
dispose of the same as permitted under law.  Given the facts as stated 
above, there cannot be any act of negligence on part of the nominees of 
KPCL in this regard as well. 
17. 
The CAG report is without factual basis for the following 
reasons: 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 69 of 101 
 
i) 
The quantum of rejects is assumed as 10% of the coal based on 
MoU whereas as per actuals it was 4.39% as evident from the Coal 
Controller’s certificate, Statements of inward and outward 
movements of Coal as submitted by GCWL. 
ii) 
Without even knowing the calorific value of the rejects, it has been 
assumed to be G Grade coal.  Even going by the statement of Shri 
Padmesh Gupta of GCWL, the rejects were of such a low calorific 
value that it could not be sold without blending.  Hence, it could not 
have been of G grade.  Hence, the basis of the calculation is wrong. 
xxxxx 
20. 
The assumption of the CBI that the exact quantity of rejects 
that have been sold off cannot be ascertained is a self-serving 
statement inasmuch as for the purpose of blending of coal, Gupta 
has to purchase the raw coal / washed coal and pay royalty / sales 
tax on the same whereas there is no sales tax / royalty paid on the 
rejects.  With this number, it is easily possible to arrive at the exact 
quantity of reject coal.  As the quantity of reject coal generated / 
available at Majri Washery as per the Stock statement far exceeds 
the reject coal quantity claimed to be generated by the washing of 
KECML’s coal, in order to divert other rejects as KECML’s rejects, 
the absurdly high amount has been claimed.  Hence, there is 
absolutely no evidence to show that any reject has been sold and if so, 
what is the quantity of rejects sold.  In such a situation, there is no 
basis for assuming that KPCL has suffered any unlawful loss or that 
GCWL has gained unlawfully during this process. 
21. 
CBI has produced a Debit Note No.KECML/DN/08-09/09 dated 
31.03.2009 for Rs.4,30,38,500/- which was recovered at GCWL (and not 
at KECML) and there is a statement from GCWL that this Debit Note was 
not honoured.  An examination of the Debit Note, Annual Accounts 
of KECML for 2008-09 and other documents produced along with 
the Report would indicate that this Debit Note is a fabricated 
document for the following reasons: 
a. 
The Note is generated as on the last date of the financial year 2008-2009 
but is forwarded only in the next financial year in September 2009 
indicating that it is an afterthought. 
b. 
This Debit Note does not find a mention in the Annual Accounts of 2008-
2009 i.e. it should have created an income stream for KECML. 
c. 
If the Debit Note was a genuine document, then KECML had to classify 
the sales of washer rejects of 86,077 MT as “other income” in the Annual 
Accounts.  However, it is shown as washing loss. 
d. 
There are no corresponding Debit Notes of this nature (viz. For foreign 
material) amongst the several admitted Debit Notes and no mention of 
this Debit Note or such an arrangement for subsequent years. 
e. 
KECML officials have written emails asking for accounts of the stock and 
Gupta has stated that the rejects are still lying with them. 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 70 of 101 
 
 
22. 
There are two types of rejects as reflected in the Annual 
accounts.  One is the rejects lost due to stones, boulders etc. for 
which no royalty was paid.  These rejects were not even transported 
to Gupta and are not classified as ‘washery loss’.  The washery loss 
is evident from the Coal Controller’s certificates. 
xxxxx 
38. 
To say the least, there is no evidence whatsoever that is 
collected by the investigator that would indicate that there was either any 
request or a demand by the public servant concerned for a valuable thing 
or a pecuniary advantage at any point of time upon the beneficiary for 
any reason whatsoever.  A mere omission on the part of the public 
servant or a negligent act on his part which has enured to the beneficiary 
cannot be said to act of misconduct on the part of the public servant to 
bring him within the ambit of Section 13(1) (d) of the Prevention of 
Corruption Act, 1988. 
xxxxxx 
48. 
Shri R. Nagaraja has an impeccable and unblemished 
service record in his 27 years of service as an officer and he has 
held many important and sensitive posts during his service span in 
KPCL.  Any action against him on the basis of a charge devoid of 
any merit and substance would not only tarnish his otherwise 
impeccable reputation but will also have a bearing on the morale of 
the public services. 
49. 
For the reasons enumerated in para 3 to 48 above, we, the 
Board of KPCL, hereby exercising our powers under Section 19 of 
the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 refuse to grant sanction to 
prosecute Shri R. Nagaraja for the offences alleged to have been 
committed under Sections 120B r/w 409 and 420 of the Indian Penal 
Code, 1860 and Sections 13(2) read with 13(1)(d) of the Prevention 
of Corruption Act, 1988.” 
 
12.2. It is apparent from the above that after Sanctioning Authority had scrutinized all 
the relevant documents and the depositions as many as of 67 witnesses submitted by 
the respondent-CBI, it observed that there was no evidence to show that any rejects 
generated by washing of coal had been sold or that KPCL had suffered an unlawful 
loss during the process. As a result, the Board of KPCL refused to grant sanction to the 
respondent-CBI to prosecute Mr. R. Nagaraja for offences alleged to have been 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 71 of 101 
 
committed by him. It is noteworthy that no appeal has been filed by the respondent – 
CBI against denial of sanction.  
12.3. Similarly, the request made by the respondent-CBI for seeking sanction to 
prosecute Mr. Yogendra Tripathi, the then Managing Director, KPCL was denied by the 
Competent Authority in the Central Government in terms of the letter dated 16th April, 
2018, issued by the DoPT. The order passed by the DoPT shows that it took note of 
the Report of the respondent-CBI, the records submitted by it along with the Report, 
the advice received from the CVC and then summarized the allegations levelled by the 
respondent-CBI that formed the basis of its proposal to seek sanction for prosecution 
of the aforesaid officer.  The said request was finally rejected by the Competent 
Authority in the Central Government with the following observations: 
 
“xxxxx 
12. 
AND WHEREAS the debit note recovered at GCWL and the 
certificate are contradictory to each other in as much as debit note 
imposes a realizable value on the rejects and the certificate claims that it 
has been written off.  Neither document is supported by the annual 
accounts.  Hence, they are extraneous and fabricated as an afterthought. 
13. 
AND WHEREAS washery loss and loss due to stone bounders 
etc. are different.  The certificate combines the two losses and claims 
them as washing loss.  The rejects quantified as 8.03. MT only 
reproduces what is disclosed in the accounts as processed wastage. 
14. 
AND WHEREAS on examination of records, statement of 
witnesses etc, it was seen that there is no evidence of any purported 
conspiracy between the accused officer and GCWL or any quid pro quo 
in this regard.  The reason for deferring the agenda in 41st Board Meeting 
have been explained in the detailed note of M/s KPCL and appear to be 
reasonable.  It has been mentioned that the revised mining plan was 
approved in the Board Meeting of the Joint Venture KECML by which a 
new technology was to be implemented which could have been issued of 
rejection irrelevant. 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 72 of 101 
 
15. 
AND WHEREAS the comments of the Govt. of Karnataka 
have been obtained.  They have stated that there is no material to 
support the allegation that he conspired to illegally dispose off the 
rejects and therefore deferred the agenda.  Hence, no criminal intent 
can be attributed to Shri Yogendra Tripathi and have recommended 
declining of sanction for prosecution U/s 120B r/w 409 and 420 of 
IPC and Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. 
16. 
AND WHEREAS the proposal was sent to the CVC for their 
advice.  The CVC advised declining of sanction for prosecution 
against Shri Yogendra Tripathi, IAS(KN:1985), the then Managing 
Director Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. (KPCL), Bangalore, in case 
RC:2202015 E0002 dated 13.03.2015. 
17. 
AND WHEREAS all case records sent by the investigating 
agency were sent to the Hon’ble Prime Minister, who is the 
Competent Authority in the Central Government, to decide sanction 
for prosecution in respect of the IAS officers. 
18. 
AND THEREFORE The Competent Authority, in view of the 
above position and after carefully considering the facts and 
circumstances of the case and considering all other relevant 
material/documents, including evidence submitted by the 
Investigating Agency with the proposal, has approved the proposal 
to decline sanction for prosecution against Shri Yogendra Tripathi, 
IAS (KN:85) in the instant case, under Section 19 of the Prevention 
of Corruption Act, 1988.” 
 
12.4. The aforesaid order reveals that before applying its mind, the Competent 
Authority in the Central Government had sought comments from the Government of 
Karnataka who had stated that there was no material produced by the respondent-CBI 
in support of the allegation that Mr. Yogendra Tripathi had conspired to illegally dispose 
off the coal rejects or with malafide intention deferred the agenda in the 41st Board 
Meeting of the KPCL. The Competent Authority separately sent the said proposal 
submitted by the respondent-CBI to the CVC for seeking advice. After examining all the 
records sent by the investigation agency including the evidence submitted by it, the 
Office of the Prime Minister who is the Competent Authority in the Central Government, 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 73 of 101 
 
approved the proposal to decline the sanction for prosecuting Mr. Yogendra Tripathi. 
Yet again, no appeal has been filed by the respondent – CBI before the court 
questioning the said decision.  
12.5. The respondent-CBI having accepted the decision taken by the Sanctioning 
Authority in respect of Mr. R. Nagaraja and the decision of the Competent Authority in 
the Central Government in respect of Mr. Yogendra Tripathi, both senior most serving 
officers of KPCL and were also on the Board of KECML, cannot be permitted to argue 
that these were merely administrative decisions and even if permission to prosecute 
the aforesaid officers has been denied, the Department can still proceed against the 
appellants based on the very same set of material/documents/evidence etc. that have 
been minutely scrutinized by different authorities at the highest level and they have 
independently arrived at an identical conclusion of refusing to grant sanction to 
prosecute senior functionaries of KPCL. Simply because the said senior functionaries 
of KPCL were public servants, does not detract from the fact that the respondent-CBI 
has described them as co-accused in a criminal conspiracy and attributed similar 
motives to them as the appellants herein. If they have been let off the hook and the 
respondent-CBI has not challenged the said decisions, there is no reason to proceed 
against the appellants herein on the basis of the very same set of facts and material 
gathered during the course of investigation.  
13. 
EFFECT OF THE ABSENCE OF ANY STRATEGY IN THE MINING PLAN TO 
DISPOSE OFF THE COAL REJECTS  
 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 74 of 101 
 
13.1. Coming next to the stand taken by the respondent-CBI that absence of any plan 
mentioned in the Mining Plan to deal with the rejects could not exonerate the appellants 
who were bound by the terms and conditions of the letter dated 10th November, 2003 
issued by the MoC, we may note the assertion of the respondent-CBI that the Mining 
Plan of the coal blocks in question did not contain any plan for disposal of rejects, 
usable, tailings, middlings, etc., that would be generated on account of mining/ washing 
of coal, is contrary to the records. Article 5(2)(b) of the JVA required EMTA to take all 
clearances for setting up the coal washery from the concerned authorities and properly 
dispose off the coal rejects to the satisfaction of environmental regulations.   
13.2. The explanation offered by the appellants that at that point in time, the Central 
Government had not come out with any specific plan to dispose off the coal rejects is 
validated by the reply furnished by the Minister of State, MoC, in the Lok Sabha in 
response to an unstarred question seeking an answer from the Government of India as 
to whether it had framed any National Policy for exploitation of the coal rejects.  The 
reply given was that the Government had not framed any National Policy for exploitation 
of coal rejects and the same was still under consideration.   That being the position, it 
was left to KPCL and KECML to devise a satisfactory and safe method to dispose off 
the coal rejects. This was done in terms of Article 5(2)(b) of the JVA that required 
KECML to dispose off the rejects in a manner that would ensure that there was no 
threat to the environment.  We do not find any irregularity in the route adopted to 
dispose off the coal rejects. 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 75 of 101 
 
14.  
WAS KECML REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COAL REJECTS ? 
14.1. Much emphasis has been laid by the respondent-CBI on the contents of the 
allocation letter dated 10th November, 2003 issued by the MoC, Government of India to 
KPCL to canvass that the coal mined from the allocated blocks was to be exclusively 
used to meet the requirements of coal in the proposed thermal power station namely, 
BTPS and on the condition that no coal was to be sold /delivered/transferred/disposed 
of except for the purpose of power generation and with the previous approval of the 
Central Government. We are afraid, the said letter cannot be read in isolation and out 
of context for the very same reasons as have been noted above. 
14.2 When the Central Government did not formulate any National Policy for 
exploitation of coal rejects, it is fallacious on the part of the respondent-CBI to argue 
that the conditions imposed by the Central Government while conveying its approval to 
the State Government for grant of mining lease in favour of KPCL ought to have formed 
a part of the lease deed to be executed.   Fact of the matter is that there was no such 
condition imposed in the Notification dated 16th July, 2004, issued by the MoC. The said 
notification simply specified  the end use of the coal from the allocated coal blocks for 
supply to KPCL to generate thermal power in the proposed BPCL. The original Mining 
Plan of September, 2004 submitted by KECML to the MoC for its approval also did not 
elucidate the manner in which the coal rejects were to be disposed of. The said Mining 
Plan had the approval of the MoC which did not raise any objection relating to the 
absence of any condition for dealing with the coal rejects.  The inevitable conclusion is 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 76 of 101 
 
that disposal of the coal rejects was to be undertaken by KECML strictly in terms of 
Article 5(2)(b) of the JVA and no more. 
14.3 Moreover, a closer look at the clauses of the JVA and FSA clearly indicate that 
KECML was only obliged to provide a specified grade of washed coal (Grade – D) 
having a specific GCV in the range of 4200-4940 Kcal/kg85.  When coal has been 
defined in the JVA and FSA as “washed coal with guaranteed value” and one that 
satisfied the parameters laid down in Annex-1 attached to the JVA and FSA86 and 
further, KECML was required to ensure that all “shales/stones” are removed from the 
coal before making the supply87, there was no occasion for KECML to account for the 
rejects. All that KPCL was required to do was to buy from KECML, the washed coal 
with a particular guaranteed value and one that would satisfy the specified quality 
parameters, at a predetermined price88. The agreement governing the parties required 
KECML to dispose off the rejects safely. KECML was not required to account for the 
coal rejects to KPCL.  KPCL itself understood the clauses in the JVA and the FSA to 
mean the same and it was satisfied with the manner in which KECML was discharging 
its obligations under the agreements till Audit Objections were raised by the CAG in 
October, 2013. That’s when KPCL did a complete flip flop and for the first time, raised 
a demand on KECML seeking reimbursement towards the value of the coal rejects, a 
 
85 ‘Grade D Coal’ as defined under ‘Definition and Interpretation’ clause of the JVA dt 13th September, 2002. 
86 ‘Coal’ as defined under ‘Definition and Interpretation’ clause of the JVA dt. 13th September, 2002 and 
Article 1 of FSA dt. 09th May, 2007 
87 Article 5.2.2 of the FSA 
88 Annexure-II of the JVA and Article 6.1.1 of the FSA 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 77 of 101 
 
decision that was successfully assailed by the appellants in the High Court and the 
challenge laid by KPCL to the said judgement was repelled by this Court.   
 
15. 
CAN KECML BE BLAMED FOR NOT SETTING UP THE COAL WASHERY AT 
THE PITHEAD ? 
 
15.1. As for the allegation levelled by the respondent–CBI that KECML violated the 
terms of Articles 2(4)(g) and 5(2)(b) of the JVA having failed to setup the coal washery 
at the pithead, the sequence of events narrated above, shows that the fault does not 
lie at the door of the appellants.  It was on account of some litigation between CIPCO 
and MoC in relation to the coal blocks allocated to KPCL wherein interim orders were 
granted by the High Court in favour of CIPCO, that the project got delayed. Production 
of coal could commence only in September, 2008 after the aforesaid litigation came to 
an end.   By then, much time was lost.  The conditions stipulated in the agreements 
governing KPCL and KECML placed an obligation on KECML to supply washed coal 
with a definite GCV and specified parameters for the consumption of the Thermal 
Power Station at Bellary and failure to deliver coal within the stipulated time, attracted 
penalties.   
15.2. It was in this background that KECML executed the MoU with GCWL for washing 
of the mined coal at its washery at Majri, transportation of the raw coal from the mines 
and washed coal to the Railway Siding for delivery to BTPS.  Records reveal that the 
draft of MoU was duly deliberated upon by the Board of Directors of KECML and finally 
approved and ratified on 13th January, 2009.  Subsequently, in the meeting held on 23rd 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 78 of 101 
 
February, 2010, the Board of Directors of KECML concluded that washing of raw coal 
was a prerequisite to meet the specified grade of coal with a defined GCV for generation 
of power at BTPS.  The necessity of supplying washed coal to obtain the agreed 
parameter of coal quality was also recognized by the office of the Coal Controller in its 
letter dated 9th December, 2009.   This fact finds mention in the detailed Report of the 
Board of KPCL that refused permission to the respondent-CBI to prosecute Mr. R. 
Nagaraja. 
15.3 It is clear from the above that the decision of KECML to enter into a MoU with 
GCWL for washing of coal was actuated by compelling circumstance faced by it and 
KPCL had taken a calibrated decision in its commercial wisdom to duly concur with the 
said decision knowing very well that non-supply of a specified grade of washed coal by 
KECML would have serious consequences of stoppage of generation of power at BTPS 
and a cascading effect of resulting in a power crisis in the State of Karnataka.    
15.4. We do not propose to Labour much on the contention of the respondent-CBI 
that allocation of the coal block was in favour of KPCL and not in favour of KECML as 
stands adequately explained on a perusal of the Notification dated 16th July, 2024 which 
shows that the Central Government did recognize the fact that it was KECML who was 
required to supply coal from the coal mines allocated to KPCL and end use of the said 
coal was specified for generation of Thermal Power Station at Bellary, Karnataka.  In 
our view, having regard to the aforesaid notification, nothing much turns on the 
submission made by the respondent-CBI that the coal block allocation was only in 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 79 of 101 
 
favour of KPCL and it ought to have a right over the rejects to the exclusion of KECML 
and others.  
16. 
DID THE COAL REJECTS HAVE ANY USEFLUL CALORIFIC VALUE 
MAKING IT A SALEABLE COMMODITY ? 
 
16.1. We find that the Detailed Washability Report of the Government Laboratory 
namely, CIMFR, Nagpur has been ignored by the respondent-CBI.  It was the said 
Report that formed the basis of the information furnished by KECML with respect to 
production, stock, despatch of coal to the washery etc., as was demanded by the office 
of the Coal Controller, a department that falls under the MoC.  The said Report stated 
in so many words that the rejects did not contain any useful c.v.  Reliance placed by 
the respondent-CBI on the revised Mining Plan submitted by the appellants to the MoC 
in 2010, that mentions a new technology for utilization of rejects for its carbon value, 
namely FBC is of no consequence as the said technology had not even been introduced 
when MoC approved the original Mining Plan, submitted by KECML in the year 2004. 
Even otherwise, it is not in dispute that for applying the said technology, a plant was 
required to be established after obtaining necessary approvals from several agencies.  
The plant could not be established by KECML for the reason that the revised Mining 
Plan submitted by it was approved by the MoC only on 24th August, 2011. Consequent 
steps that were required to be taken by KECML for obtaining necessary approvals from 
the MoEF&CC and other govt. agencies came to a grinding halt when an order was 
passed by this Court in the year 2014, deallocating all captive coal blocks, including 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 80 of 101 
 
those allocated to KPCL. Therefore, any reference by the respondent-CBI to the 
revised Mining Plan is of no consequence.  
 
17. 
PERSUASIVE VALUE OF THE ARYAN ENERGY CASE 
17.1 KPCL’s entitlement over the coal rejects has been separately tested by the High 
Court of Karnataka in the case of Aryan Energy(supra). Pertinently, in that case the 
clauses forming a part of the Agreement between KPCL and Aryan Energy particularly 
with respect to the disposal of the coal rejects is the same as in the instant case. Aryan 
Energy was also required to dispose off the coal rejects by making compliance of the 
environmental regulations. In the said case, the High Court of Karnataka returned a 
finding that KPCL did not have any claim over the coal rejects generated during washing 
of coal.  The view taken was that as long as disposal of the coal rejects was in line with 
the environmental regulations, KPCL did not have any role to play in the disposal of the 
coal rejects. It was specifically observed by the High Court that the agreement between 
KPCL and Aryan Energy included a condition that KPCL would only buy washed coal 
at a predetermined price and that it was not entitled to lay a claim on the coal rejects 
generated during the processing of raw coal. In view of the terms and conditions of the 
agreement between the parties, the High Court concluded that KPCL could not have 
raised any demand on Aryan Energy claiming reimbursement for the value of the coal 
rejects. It is a matter of record that although KPCL had challenged the judgement and 
order dated 22nd July, 2021 passed by the High Court of Karnataka44 before this court, 
the said petitions were disposed of on 26th April, 2014 noting that the parties had settled 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 81 of 101 
 
their inter se disputes amongst themselves in terms of a Compromise Deed and as a 
result, part of the decretal amount deposited by KPCL before the Commercial Court 
was agreed to be released in favour of Aryan Energy.  
17.2 We do not see why the aforesaid decision would not have any persuasive value 
when the clauses in the agreement between KPCL and KECML for disposing off the 
coal rejects are identical. On going through the agreements executed between KPCL 
and Aryan Energy, the High Court had shot down the plea of KPCL that it was entitled 
to the coal rejects. Though KPCL assailed the said decision before this Court, it settled 
its dispute with Aryan Energy and the appeals preferred by it were disposed of as 
compromised. The contention of the respondent-CBI that the order of the High Court of 
Karnataka is not relevant for the present case since there was no criminal case 
registered therein, cannot be a distinguishing feature when the terms and conditions of 
the contract between KPCL and Aryan Energy on the aspect of disposal of the coal 
rejects is pari materia. We are of the opinion that the judgment in the case of Aryan 
Energy does have persuasive value. 
 
18. 
INHERENT JURISDICTION OF THE HIGH COURT UNDER SECTION 482, 
Cr.P.C 
18.1. For seeking quashing of the chargesheet and the order framing charges, 
learned counsel for the appellants has cited decisions of this court that lay down the 
proposition of law relating to quashing of criminal proceedings by a High Court under 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 82 of 101 
 
Section 482, Cr.P.C. In Rajiv Thapar and Others v. Madan Lal Kapoor89, this court 
held as under: 
“29. The issue being examined in the instant case is the jurisdiction of the High 
Court under Section 482 CrPC, if it chooses to quash the initiation of the 
prosecution against an accused at the stage of issuing process, or at the stage 
of committal, or even at the stage of framing of charges. These are all stages 
before the commencement of the actual trial. The same parameters would 
naturally be available for later stages as well. The power vested in the High 
Court under Section 482 CrPC, at the stages referred to hereinabove, would 
have far-reaching consequences inasmuch as it would negate the 
prosecution's/complainant's case without allowing the prosecution/complainant 
to lead evidence. Such a determination must always be rendered with caution, 
care and circumspection. To invoke its inherent jurisdiction under Section 
482 CrPC the High Court has to be fully satisfied that the material 
produced by the accused is such that would lead to the conclusion that 
his/their defence is based on sound, reasonable, and indubitable facts; the 
material produced is such as would rule out and displace the assertions 
contained in the charges levelled against the accused; and the material 
produced is such as would clearly reject and overrule the veracity of the 
allegations 
contained 
in 
the 
accusations 
levelled 
by 
the 
prosecution/complainant. It should be sufficient to rule out, reject and 
discard the accusations levelled by the prosecution/complainant, without 
the necessity of recording any evidence. For this the material relied upon by 
the defence should not have been refuted, or alternatively, cannot be justifiably 
refuted, being material of sterling and impeccable quality. The material relied 
upon by the accused should be such as would persuade a reasonable 
person to dismiss and condemn the actual basis of the accusations as 
false. In such a situation, the judicial conscience of the High Court would 
persuade it to exercise its power under Section 482 CrPC to quash such 
criminal proceedings, for that would prevent abuse of process of the court, 
and secure the ends of justice.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   [emphasis added] 
18.2 In the captioned case, this court had further observed that the discretion vested 
in the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C can be exercised suo moto to prevent abuse 
of the process of a Court, and/or to secure the ends of justice. After listing the factors 
 
89 (2013) 3 SCC 330 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 83 of 101 
 
that ought to weigh with the High Court to make a just and rightful choice, it was 
observed thus:   
   
“30. Based on the factors canvassed in the foregoing paragraphs, we would 
delineate the following steps to determine the veracity of a prayer for quashment 
raised by an accused by invoking the power vested in the High Court under 
Section 482 CrPC: 
30.1. Step one: whether the material relied upon by the accused is sound, 
reasonable, and indubitable i.e. the material is of sterling and impeccable quality? 
30.2. Step two: whether the material relied upon by the accused would rule out 
the assertions contained in the charges levelled against the accused i.e. the 
material is sufficient to reject and overrule the factual assertions contained in the 
complaint i.e. the material is such as would persuade a reasonable person to 
dismiss and condemn the factual basis of the accusations as false? 
30.3. Step three: whether the material relied upon by the accused has not been 
refuted by the prosecution/complainant; and/or the material is such that it cannot 
be justifiably refuted by the prosecution/complainant? 
30.4. Step four: whether proceeding with the trial would result in an abuse of 
process of the court, and would not serve the ends of justice? 
30.5. If the answer to all the steps is in the affirmative, the judicial 
conscience of the High Court should persuade it to quash such criminal 
proceedings in exercise of power vested in it under Section 482 CrPC. Such 
exercise of power, besides doing justice to the accused, would save 
precious court time, which would otherwise be wasted in holding such a 
trial (as well as proceedings arising therefrom) specially when it is clear 
that the same would not conclude in the conviction of the accused.” 
                                         
 
 
 
 
     [emphasis added] 
18.3 In State of Orissa v. Debendra Nath Padhi90, the powers of the High Court 
under Section 482, Cr.P.C and Article 226 of the Constitution of India were highlighted 
and the court observed that: 
“29. Regarding the argument of the accused having to face the trial despite 
being in a position to produce material of unimpeachable character of sterling 
quality, the width of the powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the 
Code and Article 226 of the Constitution is unlimited whereunder in the 
interests of justice the High Court can make such orders as may be 
necessary to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to 
 
90 (2005) 1 SCC  568 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 84 of 101 
 
secure the ends of justice within the parameters laid down in Bhajan Lal 
case91 [1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 426] .” 
   [emphasis added] 
 
18.4 In Rukmini Narvekar v. Vijaya Satardekar and Others92, this Court has 
observed that the width of the powers of the High Court under Section 482, Cr.P.C and 
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India are unlimited, that the High Court could 
make such orders as may be necessary to prevent abuse of the process of any Court 
or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In a concurring order passed in the very 
same case, it was observed in addition that in exercising jurisdiction under Section 482, 
Cr.P.C, the High Court is free to consider even material that may be produced on behalf 
of the accused to arrive at a decision whether charge as framed could be maintained.  
18.5 In Anand Kumar Mohatta and Another v. State (NCT of Delhi), Department 
of Home and Another93, referring to the provisions of Section 482, Cr.P.C, this Court 
held as follows:  
16. There is nothing in the words of this section which restricts the exercise of 
the power of the Court to prevent the abuse of process of court or miscarriage 
of justice only to the stage of the FIR. It is settled principle of law that the High 
Court can exercise jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC even when the 
discharge application is pending with the trial court [G. Sagar Suri v. State of 
U.P., (2000) 2 SCC 636, para 7 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 513. Umesh Kumar v. State 
of A.P., (2013) 10 SCC 591, para 20 : (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 338 : (2014) 2 SCC 
(L&S) 237] . Indeed, it would be a travesty to hold that proceedings initiated 
against a person can be interfered with at the stage of FIR but not if it has 
advanced and the allegations have materialised into a charge-sheet. On 
the contrary it could be said that the abuse of process caused by FIR 
stands aggravated if the FIR has taken the form of a charge-sheet after 
investigation. The power is undoubtedly conferred to prevent abuse of 
process of power of any court.

28. In State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal [State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, 1992 
Supp (1) SCC 335 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 426] , this Court has set out the categories 
of cases in which the inherent power under Section 482 CrPC can be exercised. 
Para 102 of the judgment reads as follows : (SCC pp. 378-79) 
 
“102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant 
provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law 
enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise 
of the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers 
under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted and 
reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of 
illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent 
abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of 
justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly 
defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid 
formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein 
such power should be exercised. 
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the 
complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in 
their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a 
case against the accused. 
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other 
materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable 
offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 
156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the 
purview of Section 155(2) of the Code. 
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint 
and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the 
commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused. 
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable 
offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is 
permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as 
contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code. 
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd 
and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can 
ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for 
proceeding against the accused. 
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the 
provisions of the Code or the Act concerned (under which a criminal 
proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the 
proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or 
the Act concerned, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the 
aggrieved party. 
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide 
and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior 
motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite 
him due to private and personal grudge.” 
    

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024

18.6. In State of Karnataka vs. L. Munniswamy94, Y.V. Chandrachud, J. as he then 
was (speaking for a three Judge Bench) observed thus:  
“7. … In the exercise of this wholesome power, the High Court is entitled to quash a 
proceeding if it comes to the conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue 
would be an abuse of the process of the Court or that the ends of justice require that 
the proceeding ought to be quashed. The saving of the High Court's inherent 
powers, both in civil and criminal matters, is designed to achieve a salutary 
public purpose which is that a court proceeding ought not to be permitted to 
degenerate into a weapon of harassment or persecution. In a criminal case, 
the veiled object behind a lame prosecution, the very nature of the material on 
which the structure of the prosecution rests and the like would justify the High 
Court in quashing the proceeding in the interest of justice.” 
[ emphasis added ] 
 
 
18.7 As can be gathered from the above, Section 482 Cr.P.C recognizes the inherent 
powers of the High Court to quash initiation of prosecution against the accused to pass 
such orders as may be considered necessary to give effect to any order under the 
Cr.P.C or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends 
of justice. It is a statutory power vested in the High Court to quash such criminal 
proceedings that would dislodge the charges levelled against the accused and based 
on the material produced, lead to a firm opinion that the assertions contained in the 
charges levelled by the prosecution deserve to be overruled. 
18.8 While exercising the powers vested in the High Court under Section 482, Cr.P.C, 
whether at the stage of issuing process or at the stage of committal or even at the stage 
of framing of charges, which are all stages that are prior to commencement of the actual 
 
94 (1977) 2 SCC 699 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 87 of 101 
 
trial, the test to be applied is that the Court must be fully satisfied that the material 
produced by the accused would lead to a conclusion that their defence is based on 
sound, reasonable and indubitable facts. The material relied on by the accused should 
also be such that would persuade a reasonable person to dismiss the accusations 
levelled against them as false. 
 
 
19. 
EXTRAORDINARY POWERS OF THIS COURT UNDER ARTICLE 13 OF THE 
CONSTITUTION OF INDIA 
 
19.1. When it comes to invocation of the powers vested in this Court under Article 136 
of the Constitution of India, unlike Section 438 Cr.P.C that has a statutory flavour, Article 
136 confers plenary powers on this Court to interfere in suitable cases.   In 
Arunachalam v. P.S.R. Sadhanantham and Another95, this court has expounded on 
the amplitude of its powers under Article 136 in the following words: 
“4. ……Article 136 of the Constitution of India invests the Supreme Court with 
a plentitude of plenary, appellate power over all Courts and Tribunals in India. 
The power is plenary in the sense that there are no words in Article 136 itself 
qualifying that power. But, the very nature of the power has led the Court to 
set limits to itself within which to exercise such power. It is now the well 
established practice of this Court to permit the invocation of the power under Article 
136 only in very exceptional circumstances, as when a question of law of general 
public importance arises or a decision shocks the conscience of the Court. But, 
within the restrictions imposed by itself, this Court has the undoubted power 
to interfere even with findings of fact, making no distinction between 
judgments of acquittal and conviction, if the High Court, in arriving at those 
findings, has acted “perversely or otherwise improperly”. (See State of 
Madras v. A. Vaidyanatha Iyer [AIR 1958 SC 61 : 1958 SCR 580 : 1958 Cri LJ 232] 
and Himachal Pradesh Administration v. Om Prakash [(1972) 1 SCC 249 : 
(1972) 2 SCR 765] )…….”   
 
5. 
A doubt has been raised about the competence of a private party, as 
distinguished from the State, to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 
136 of the Constitution against a judgment of acquittal by the High Court. We do 
 
95 (1979) 2 SCC 297 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 88 of 101 
 
not see any substance in the doubt. Appellate power vested in the Supreme 
Court under Article 136 of the Constitution is not to be confused with ordinary 
appellate power exercised by appellate courts and Appellate Tribunals under 
specific statutes. As we said earlier, it is a plenary power, ‘exercisable 
outside the purview of ordinary law’ to meet the pressing demands of justice 
(vide Durga Shankar Mehta v. Thakur Raghuraj Singh [AIR 1954 SC 520 : 
(1955) 1 SCR 267 : 1954 SCJ 723] ). Article 136 of the Constitution neither 
confers on anyone the right to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court 
nor inhibits anyone from invoking the Court's jurisdiction. The power is 
vested in the Supreme Court but the right to invoke the Court's jurisdiction 
is vested in no one. The exercise of the power of the Supreme Court is not 
circumscribed by any limitation as to who may invoke it. ……... Appeals under 
Article 136 of the Constitution are entertained by special leave granted by this 
Court, whether it is the State or a private party that invokes the jurisdiction of this 
Court, special leave is not granted as a matter of course but only for good and 
sufficient reasons, as well established by the practice of this Court.” 
        [emphasis added] 
 
19.2. In P.S.R. Sadhanantham v. Arunachalam96,  a Constitution Bench of five 
judges elaborated the content and character of Article 136 vis-à-vis Article 21 and made 
the following observations:   
“7. Specificity being essential to legality, let us see if the broad spectrum spread out of 
Article 136 fills the bill from the point of view of “procedure established by law”. In express 
terms, Article 136 does not confer a right of appeal on a party as such but it confers 
a wide discretionary power on the Supreme Court to interfere in suitable cases. The 
discretionary dimension is considerable but that relates to the power of the court. The 
question is whether it spells by implication, fair a procedure as contemplated by Article 21. 
In our view, it does. Article 136 is a special jurisdiction. It is residuary power; it is 
extraordinary in its amplitude, its limit, when it chases injustice, is the sky itself. 
This Court functionally fulfils itself by reaching out to injustice wherever it is and 
this power is largely derived in the common run of cases from Article 136. Is if merely 
a power in the court to be exercised in any manner it fancies? Is there no procedural 
limitation in the manner of exercise and the occasion for exercise? Is there no duty to act 
fairly while hearing a case under Article 136, either in the matter of grant of leave or, after 
such grant, in the final disposal of the appeal? We have hardly any doubt that here is a 
procedure necessarily implicit in the power vested in the summit court. It must be 
remembered that Article 136 confers jurisdiction on the highest court. The founding 
fathers unarguably intended in the very terms of Article 136 that it shall be exercised 
by the highest judges of the land with scrupulous adherence to judicial principles 
well established by precedents in our jurisprudence. Judicial discretion is canalised 
authority, not arbitrary eccentricity…..

96 (1980) 3 SCC 141 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024

10.  Once we hold that Article 136 is a composite provision which vests a wide 
jurisdiction and, by the very fact of entrusting this unique jurisdiction in the 
Supreme Court, postulates, inarticulately though, the methodology of exercising 
that power, nothing more remains in the objection of the petitioner. It is open to the 
court to grant special leave and the subsequent process of hearing are (sic is) well-
established. Thus, there is an integral provision of power-cum-procedure which answers 
with the desideratum of Article 21 justifying deprivation of life and liberty. 
            [emphasis added] 
 
In a concurring judgement in the captioned case, it was further observed that: 
 
21. Plainly, the jurisdiction conferred by Article 136 seeks to confer on this Court 
the widest conceivable range of judicial power, making it perhaps among the most 
powerful courts in the world. The judicial power reaches out to every judgment, 
decree, determination, sentence or order affecting the rights and obligations of 
persons in civil matters, of life and liberty in criminal matters as well as matters 
touching the Revenues of the State. It is an attempt to ensure that the foundations of 
the Indian Republic, which have been laid on the bedrock of justice, are not undermined 
by injustice anywhere in the land, Bharat Bank Ltd.v. Employees of these Bharat 
Bank Ltd [1950 SCC 470 : AIR 1950 SC 188 : (1950) SCR 459, 474 : 1950 LLJ 21 : 
(1950-51) 2 FJR 1] . As the court observed in Durga Shankar Mehta v. Thakur 
Raghuraj Singh [AIR 1954 SC 520 : (1955) 1 SCR 267, 272 : 9 ELR 494] Article 136 
“vests in the Supreme Court a plenary jurisdiction in the matter of entertaining and 
hearing appeals by grant of special leave”. 
 
22. Nonetheless, there is a limitation which, in our opinion, is of immediate relevance. It 
is a limitation in-built in to the jurisdiction of the court and flows from the nature and 
character of the case intended to be brought before the court. It is a limitation which 
requires compliance despite the apparent plenitude of power vested in the court. When 
a petition is presented to the court under Article 136, the court will have due regard to 
the nature and character of the case sought to be brought before it when entertaining 
and disposing of the petition. 
[ emphasis added ] 
 
19.3 In Khoday Distilleries Limited and Others v. Mahadeshwara S.S.K. 
Limited97,  this Court observed that Article 136 commences with a non-obstante clause, 
the words are of overriding effect and clearly indicate the intention of the framers of the 
Constitution that it is a special jurisdiction and a repository of residuary powers 
unfettered by any Statute or any provisions of Chapter IV of Part V of the Constitution 
 
97 (2012) 12 SCC 291 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 90 of 101 
 
of India. It was also observed that the jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution 
cannot be barred by the Statute since it is an extraordinary power.   
19.4 In State of Punjab and others v. Rafiq Masih (White Washer) others98, in the 
same strain, this Court has held that Article 136 is a special jurisdiction and can be 
described as a ‘residuary power, extraordinary in its amplitude, its limits when it chases 
injustice, is the sky itself’. It is a corrective jurisdiction that vests a discretion in this 
Court to settle the law clearly and makes the law operational thereby making it a binding 
precedent for the future instead of keeping it vague.   
19.5 In Mekala Sivaiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh99, this Court commented on the 
circumstances in which the power under Article 136 is exercised and held thus:  
“14. Before adverting to the merits of the contention raised, it is important to reiterate 
that Article 136 of the Constitution of India is an extraordinary jurisdiction which 
this Court exercises when it entertains an appeal by special leave and this 
jurisdiction, by its very nature, is exercisable only when this Court is satisfied that 
it is necessary to interfere in order to prevent grave or serious miscarriage of 
justice. 
15. It is well settled by judicial pronouncement that Article 136 is worded in wide terms 
and powers conferred under the said Article are not hedged by any technical hurdles. 
This overriding and exceptional power is, however, to be exercised sparingly and only 
in furtherance of cause of justice. Thus, when the judgment under appeal has 
resulted in grave miscarriage of justice by some misapprehension or misreading 
of evidence or by ignoring material evidence then this Court is not only 
empowered but is well expected to interfere to promote the cause of justice.” 
              [emphasis added] 
 
19.6 From the aforesaid discussion, it is apparent that Article 136 can be invoked by 
a party in a petition for special leave to appeal from any judgement, decree, 
determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by a Court or 
 
98 AIR (2015) 1267

Tribunal within the territory of India. The reach of the extraordinary powers vested in 
this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India is boundless. Such unbridled 
powers have been vested in Court, not just to prevent the abuse of the process of any 
court or to secure the ends of justice as contemplated in Section 482, Cr.P.C, but to 
ensure dispensation of justice, correct errors of law, safeguard fundamental rights, 
exercise judicial review, resolve conflicting decisions, inject consistency in the legal 
system by settling precedents and for myriad other to undo injustice, wherever noticed 
and promote the cause of justice at every level. The fetters on this power are self 
imposed and carefully tampered with sound judicial discretion. 
19.7 Coming back to the case in hand, ordinarily, a party aggrieved by the filing of a 
chargesheet or framing of charges ought to first approach the High Court in a petition 
under Section 482, Cr.P.C.  Though such a route would have been available to the 
appellants herein as well, but in view of the categorical directions issued by this court 
in M.L. Sharma (supra) that this Court alone shall have the jurisdiction to entertain 
cases relating to allocation of coal blocks including cases for staying the investigation 
or trial in a matter relating to coal, one rung of an appeal before the High Court for 
quashing the chargesheet or interfering in the order on charge by invoking the inherent 
jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C.  stands fore closed.  The appellants were left with 
only one chance of directly invoking Article 136 of the Constitution of India and filing a 
petition for special leave before this court to challenge the impugned orders passed by 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 92 of 101 
 
the learned Special Judge, CBI framing charges against them and dismissing their 
application for seeking discharge.   
19.9 Given the broad amplitude of the extraordinary powers of this Court under Article 
136 of the Constitution of India, the respondent-CBI cannot be heard to urge that since 
a Chargesheet has already been filed against the appellants and charges framed, the 
appellants should be left to take all the pleas available to them before the learned 
Special Judge, CBI during the course of the trial and that no interference is called for 
by this Court at this stage. Such an approach does not commend itself to this Court in 
the facts and circumstances of this case.     
20. 
APPLICATION OF MIND AT THE STAGE OF SECTION 227, Cr.P.C 
20.1 We may note that there is no quarrel with the broad proposition canvassed by 
learned counsel for the respondent- CBI that at the stage of Section 227, Cr.P.C., the 
Special Judge, CBI had to sift the evidence to find out whether there was sufficient 
ground for proceedings against the appellants. That exercise would include taking a 
prima facie view on the nature of the evidence recorded by the CBI and the documents 
placed before the court so as to frame any charge. At the same time, one must be 
mindful of the language used in Section 227 of the Cr.P.C, which is extracted below: 
“227. Discharge.—If, upon consideration of the record of the case and the 
documents submitted therewith, and after hearing the submissions of the accused 
and the prosecution in this behalf, the Judge considers that there is not sufficient 
ground for proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the accused and 
record his reasons for so doing.” 
 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 93 of 101 
 
20.2. As observed in Prafulla Kumar Samal (supra) the expression “not sufficient 
ground for proceeding against the accused” clearly shows that the Judge is not a mere 
post office to frame the charge at the behest of the prosecution. The Judge must 
exercise the judicial mind to the facts of the case in order to determine whether a case 
for trial has been made out by the prosecution. The principles governing the scope of 
Section 227, Cr.P.C. have been succinctly summarized in the caption case as below: 
“10. Thus, on a consideration of the authorities mentioned above, the following 
principles emerge: 
(1) That the Judge while considering the question of framing the charges under 
Section 227 of the Code has the undoubted power to sift and weigh the evidence for 
the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie case against the 
accused has been made out. 
(2) Where the materials placed before the Court disclose grave suspicion against the 
accused which has not been properly explained the Court will be fully justified in 
framing a charge and proceeding with the trial. 
(3) The test to determine a prima facie case would naturally depend upon the facts 
of each case and it is difficult to lay down a rule of universal application. By and large 
however if two views are equally possible and the Judge is satisfied that the evidence 
produced before him while giving rise to some suspicion but not grave suspicion 
against the accused, he will be fully within his right to discharge the accused. 
(4) That in exercising his jurisdiction under Section 227 of the Code the Judge 
which under the present Code is a senior and experienced court cannot act 
merely as a Post Office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution, but has to consider 
the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect of the evidence and the 
documents produced before the Court, any basic infirmities appearing in the 
case and so on. This however does not mean that the Judge should make a 
roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as 
if he was conducting a trial.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       [emphasis added] 
 
20.3. To the same effect is the view expressed in Niranjan Singh KS Punjabi (supra) 
where this court has observed as follows: 
“5. Section 227, introduced for the first time in the new Code, confers a special power 
on the Judge to discharge an accused at the threshold if ‘upon consideration’ of the 
record and documents he considers ‘that there is not sufficient ground’ for 
proceeding against the accused. In other words his consideration of the record and 
document at that stage is for the limited purpose of ascertaining whether or not there 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 94 of 101 
 
exists sufficient grounds for proceeding with the trial against the accused. If he 
comes to the conclusion that there is sufficient ground to proceed, he will frame a 
charge under Section 228, if not he will discharge the accused. It must be 
remembered that this section was introduced in the Code to avoid waste of 
public time over cases which did not disclose a prima facie case and to save 
the accused from avoidable harassment and expenditure. 
6. The next question is what is the scope and ambit of the ‘consideration’ by 
the trial court at that stage. ……….. It is obvious that since he is at the stage 
of deciding whether or not there exists sufficient grounds for framing the 
charge, his enquiry must necessarily be limited to deciding if the facts 
emerging from the record and documents constitute the offence with which 
the accused is charged. At that stage he may sift the evidence for that limited 
purpose but he is not required to marshal the evidence with a view to 
separating the grain from the chaff. All that he is called upon to consider is 
whether there is sufficient ground to frame the charge and for this limited 
purpose he must weigh the material on record as well as the documents relied 
on by the prosecution.” 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
                        [emphasis Added] 
20.4. In N. Suresh Rajan(supra), the following view was expressed as to the role of 
the trial Court at the time of considering an application for discharge. 
“29. We have bestowed our consideration to the rival submissions and the 
submissions made by Mr Ranjit Kumar commend us. True it is that at the time of 
consideration of the applications for discharge, the court cannot act as a 
mouthpiece of the prosecution or act as a post office and may sift evidence in 
order to find out whether or not the allegations made are groundless so as to 
pass an order of discharge. It is trite that at the stage of consideration of an 
application for discharge, the court has to proceed with an assumption that the 
materials brought on record by the prosecution are true and evaluate the said 
materials and documents with a view to find out whether the facts emerging 
therefrom taken at their face value disclose the existence of all the ingredients 
constituting the alleged offence. At this stage, probative value of the materials has 
not to be gone into and the court is not expected to go deep into the matter and hold 
that the materials would not warrant a conviction. In our opinion, what needs to be 
considered is whether there is a ground for presuming that the offence has 
been committed and not whether a ground for convicting the accused has 
been made out. To put it differently, if the court thinks that the accused might 
have committed the offence on the basis of the materials on record on its 
probative value, it can frame the charge; though for conviction, the court has 
to come to the conclusion that the accused has committed the offence. The 
law does not permit a mini trial at this stage.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         [emphasis added] 
20.5 The aforesaid parameters had to be kept in mind by the learned Special Judge, 
CBI at the time of considering the records/documents submitted by the respondent-CBI 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 95 of 101 
 
and the material produced by the appellants.  In our view, the said consideration is 
lacking in the impugned orders for the reasons noticed above. 
21. 
CONCLUSION 
21.1 Though multiple arguments have been advanced by learned counsel for the 
appellants to assail the impugned orders passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI, 
including a plea that no offence is made out under Section 13(1)(d) of the P.C. Act for 
various reasons, this Court has consciously elected to confine itself only to those 
aspects that in our opinion, would be sufficient to arrive at a prima facie view that the 
allegations levelled against the appellants have pre-dominant contours of a dispute of 
a civil nature, does not have the makings of a criminal offence and on an overall 
conspectus of the case, would persuade any reasonable person to dismiss the 
accusations levelled. Therefore, this court declines to go into the nitty gritties of the 
documents/evidence, or the contrasting data produced by the parties to test their 
probative value.  
21.2 The prima facie findings of this Court, based on the documents and material 
placed before us are as follows: 
(a) 
The plea of the respondent-CBI that it conducted an investigation in the present 
case during the course of the inquiry in respect of PE-5 registered by it in the year 2012 
is belied as the SIR was on a completely different aspect. CBI only got activated only 
on stumbling upon the Audit Report of the CAG submitted in 2013. There is nothing 
brought on record to show to the contrary. 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 96 of 101 
 
(b) 
The CAG Report had not attained finality inasmuch as its recommendations have 
not been tabled before the Parliament or accepted so far. The said report at best, has 
a persuasive value but no more. 
(c) 
The Sanctioning Authority namely, the Board of Directors of KPCL in respect of 
Mr. R Nagarajan, the then Finance Director of KPCL and nominee Director of the Board 
of KECML had the occasion to thoroughly scrutinize all the relevant documents 
including the MoU dated 20th December, 2008 executed between KECML and GCWL 
as also the depositions of 67 witnesses submitted by the respondent-CBI. Only 
thereafter, did it arrive at a conclusion that there was nothing to demonstrate that any 
rejects generated by washing of the coal had been sold by the appellants or that KPCL 
had suffered  an unlawful loss due to the same. 
(d) 
The Competent Authority in the Central Government who was approached by 
the respondent-CBI for sanction to prosecute Mr. Yogendra Tripathi, the then Managing 
Director of KPCL sought comments from two separate sources. The Government of 
Karnataka opined that no criminal intent could be attributed to the said officer. A 
proposal was also sent to the CVC for their advice. The CVC too recommended that 
the sanction for prosecuting the officer  ought to be declined. The Competent Authority 
in the Central Government after going through the entire documents and material 
including the evidence submitted by the respondent-CBI and the opinions solicited, 
declined sanction for the prosecution of the aforesaid officer. 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 97 of 101 
 
(e) 
 The respondent-CBI did not approach the Court to challenge the aforesaid 
decisions. Having accepted the decision taken by the Sanctioning Authority/Competent 
Authority in the Central Government and dropping the charges against the seniormost 
functionaries in KPCL, who were also holding positions in the Board of KECML, there 
is no justification to press charges against the appellants herein whose role is similar 
to them. 
(f) 
The decision dated 24th March, 2016 of the Karnataka High Court in a writ 
petition filed by KECML against KPCL has been wrongly overlooked. The High Court 
had an occasion to scrutinize the very same agreements and the CAG report that 
formed the basis of the investigation conducted by the respondent–CBI to return 
positive findings in favour of the appellants. The view taken by the Karnataka High 
Court has been upheld by this Court in a judgment rendered on 20th May, 2022 which 
was just a few days after Charges were framed by the learned Special Judge, CBI on 
3rd March, 2022.  
(g) 
Yet again, an interpretation of the very same clauses in the agreement relating 
to the manner of disposal off the coal rejects came up for consideration before the 
Karnataka High Court in a writ petition filed by Aryan Energy against KPCL. Having 
scrutinized the clauses forming a part of the agreement executed between the parties 
vide judgment dated 22nd July, 2021, the Karnataka High Court clearly observed that 
KPCL did not have any claim over the coal rejects generated during washing of the 
coal. The submissions made by the respondent – CBI that the aforesaid judgment 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 98 of 101 
 
came much after institution of the chargesheet by the, respondent-CBI is of no 
consequence. Even if that was so, nothing prevented the learned Special Judge, CBI 
from taking into consideration the view expressed in the said judgement at the time of 
framing charges, particularly, when the clause relating to disposal of the coal rejects in 
an environment friendly manner incorporated in the agreement between KPCL and 
Aryan Energy was identical to the one contained in the agreement between KPCL and 
KECML. 
(h) 
Perusal of the relevant clauses of the JVA read in conjunction with the terms and 
conditions stipulated in the FSA leave no manner of doubt that all that KPCL required 
KECML to do was to provide it a specified grade of washed coal having a specific GCV 
to be purchased at a predetermined price for being supplied to BPCL for generation of 
power. The agreement between the parties did not contemplate that KPCL would be 
entitled to claim the ‘shales/stones’ that were required to be removed from the coal 
before supplies were made by KECML. Under the agreements governing the parties 
KECML was required to dispose off the coal rejects properly, to the satisfaction of 
environmental regulation, as prescribed in Article 5(2)(b) of the JVA. 
(i) 
The MoC did not impose any condition in the Notification dated 16th July, 2004 
which required KECML to hand over the coal rejects to KPCL; nor did the MoC issue 
any Guidelines as to the manner in which the coal rejects were to be disposed of. Once 
the Mining Plan of September, 2004 submitted by KECML was approved by the MoC, 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 99 of 101 
 
nothing further was required to be done by KECML except for following the conditions 
imposed on it. 
(j) 
The Central Government had not come up with any specific plan to dispose off 
the coal rejects, as is apparent from a perusal of the reply submitted by the Minister of 
State, MoC in the Lok Sabha, stating that the Government had not framed any National 
Policy for exploitation of coal rejects and the same was still under consideration. In the 
absence of a policy to dispose off the coal rejects, the appellants cannot be blamed for 
complying with the terms and conditions stipulated in the JVA. 
(k) 
KECML could not be faulted for failing to set up the coal washery at the pithead, 
in terms of the JVA as that was for reasons beyond its control which included a 
prolonged litigation between the MoC and CIPCO in relation to the very same coal 
blocks allocated to KPCL which in turn delayed the project considerably. Production of 
coal could only commence in September, 2008 when the curtains were drawn on the 
aforesaid litigation. The Board of KPCL consciously acceded to the proposal made by 
KECML that a MoU be executed with GCWL for washing of mined coal at its washery. 
Pertinently, GCWL was not an unknown entity to KPCL as the latter had prior dealings 
with the said Company for washing of mined coal in another project.  This decision 
taken by the parties in their commercial wisdom has been sought to be selectively 
tainted with criminal intention attributed to the appellants, without any basis. 
(l) 
There was no getting around the process of washing of raw coal which was the 
predominant prerequisite to meet the specified grade of coal with the defined GCV for 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 100 of 101 
 
generation of power at BTPS. Failure to supply washed coal to KPCL not only invited 
heavy penalties on KECML in terms of the JVA, it would have had serious 
consequences of stoppage of generation of power at BTPS, resulting in power outages 
in the State of Karnataka. 
(m) The Washability Report submitted by CIMFR, Nagpur, a Government Laboratory 
stated in so many words that the coal rejects did not contain any useful c.v. Therefore, 
the entire edifice of criminality and conspiracy built by the respondent-CBI on the 
premise that the coal rejects had a commercial c.v. with an assertion that the appellants 
had profited from the sale thereof in the open market and pocketed the sale proceeds, 
flies in the face of the Washability Report.  
(n) 
The Revised Mining Plan submitted by the appellants to the MoC in the year 
2010 and approved in 2011, could not have been relied on by the respondent-CBI for 
pressing charges against the appellants on a plea that had the new technology for 
utilizing the coal rejects been put to use, the losses could have been mitigated. It is not 
in dispute that the new technology namely, FBC was not even in vogue when the MoC 
had approved the original Mining Plan submitted by KECML in the year 2004. Besides 
that, before putting the new technology to use, there were several steps required to be 
undertaken, which included obtaining approvals from different government agencies 
and establishment of a plant.  None of that could take place as an order was passed 
by this court in the year 2014, deallocating all captive coal mines. 

Criminal Appeal No. 1659-1660 of 2024 
 
Page 101 of 101 
 
21.3 In the light of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the opinion that the 
respondent–CBI embarked on a roving and fishing inquiry on the strength of the Audit 
Report of the CAG and then started working backwards to sniff out criminal intent 
against the appellants.  The underpinnings of what was a civil dispute premised on a 
contract between the parties, breach whereof could at best lead to determination of the 
contract or even the underlying lease deed, has been painted with the brush of 
criminality without any justification.  This criminal intent has been threaded into the 
dispute by the respondent-CBI by misinterpreting the clauses of the agreements 
governing the parties and by heavily banking on the observations made in the Audit 
Report of the CAG that has not attained finality till date.  In view of the glaring infirmities 
mentioned hereinabove, the impugned orders deserve interference in exercise of the 
powers vested in this court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.  
21.4 For all the reasons enumerated above, the present appeals succeed. The order 
on charge dated 24th December, 2021 and the order framing charges dated 3rd March, 
2022 passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI qua the appellants before this Court 
are unsustainable and accordingly quashed and set aside.
