the offence under Section 306 of Indian Penal 
Code, 18601.  
3. 
Facts of the case are summarised as follows: 
3.1 Appellant is the wife of deceased Sudarshan 
Gangurde, who hanged himself to death on 
17.02.2020 in his house. The appellant wife 
is accused of abetment to suicide and was 
thus charged under Section 306 of IPC. The 
complaint 
was 
filed 
by 
Smt. 
Usha 
Gangurde, mother of deceased alleging 
physical and mental harassment by the 
accused.  
3.2 Appellant Rohini and deceased Sudarshan 
had a love affair which turned into marriage 
on 09.03.2015 against the will of family 
members of both of them. The couple 
started residing separately at Shingnapur  
in Kolhapur. From the wedlock one male 
child Shoren was born on 27.05.2017. The 
couple had jointly purchased a Row House 
flat at Shingnapur where they were residing 
when the incident took place. The parents 
and family members of the deceased were 
residing at Mumbai. The deceased was 
serving in CPR Hospital at Kolhapur as 
 
1 In short, ‘IPC’ 

SLP(Crl.) No. 13246 of 2023

Social Service Superintendent. He was on 
visiting terms with his parents.  
3.3 On 17.02.2020, the deceased aged 38 
years, was found in hanging position by the 
accused wife in the balcony of common 
house they were residing at in Shingnapur. 
The neighbors informed the police. No 
suicide note was found. The post mortem 
report found no signs of injuries on the body 
of deceased. The cause of death is noted to 
be ‘due to hanging’.  
3.4 On the same day, First Information Report 
bearing No. 74/2020 was lodged by the 
mother of deceased- Smt. Usha Gangurde 
against the appellant under Section 306 of 
IPC, alleging that her son committed suicide 
due to harassment and beating by his wife 
Rohini on account of demand of money and 
for transfer of the dwelling house at 
Shingapur in her name. She further stated 
that when her son visited her, he also told 
her that his wife was abusing and beating 
him, insisting on him not to visit his parents 
and not to give them money. When her 
husband-Ashok Gangurde stayed at the 
house of deceased in May 2019, he told her 

SLP(Crl.) No. 13246 of 2023 
 
Page 4 of 12 
 
that accused Rohni was beating and 
abusing her son for money and transfer of 
house in her name. Due to these disputes, 
Rohini was residing separately from the 
deceased in her parent’s house at Sangali. 
The 
complainant 
further 
stated 
that 
accused was sending vulgar messages on 
mobile phone of the deceased. All this 
allegedly resulted in commission of suicide 
by the deceased.  
3.5 Apart from the complainant, statement of 
one of the colleagues of the deceased Ujwala 
Sawant was also recorded. She referred to 
an incident dated 17.10.2019 when the 
appellant visited deceased and created a 
ruckus in the office by rushing towards him 
on being abusive. The incidence was 
corroborated by another colleague Mr. 
Bajirao Apte.  
3.6 On the other hand, as per the statement of 
Appellant 
Rohini, 
her 
husband 
was 
addicted to liquor and there were quarrels 
between them on that ground. They tried to 
patch up as the deceased had assured to 
give up his habit to consume liquor. On this 
condition 
they 
resumed 
co-habitation. 

SLP(Crl.) No. 13246 of 2023 
 
Page 5 of 12 
 
However, the deceased could not overcome 
the habit and started to drink more. It is 
argued by the counsel for Appellant that the 
deceased may have committed suicide out 
of frustration. 
3.7 On 04.11.2020, the police filed the Charge-
sheet against appellant under section 306 
of IPC. As per the Charge-sheet, the offence 
took place on 17.02.2020 between 7.00 to 
7.30 
AM 
at 
the 
dwelling 
house 
in 
Shinganapur, where the accused harassed 
the deceased on account of money and for 
transfer of house in her name, inducing the 
deceased for attempt of suicide.  
4. 
Based on the charge-sheet, the Sessions Case 
No. 100 of 2021 is registered and pending for 
adjudication before the Sessions Court at 
Kolhapur. 
On 
02.12.2021, 
the 
Appellant-
accused preferred a discharge application before 
Trial Court. On 24.02.2022, the Trial Court 
rejected the application. Aggrieved, the appellant 
preferred Criminal Revision Application before 
the High Court. The High Court, by the impugned 
order, has dismissed the Revision and thus 
effectively dismissed the discharge application. 

SLP(Crl.) No. 13246 of 2023

Therefore, the Appellant has challenged it before 
us.  
5. 
The appellant has filed the present appeal on 
several grounds inter alia, that there is no 
evidence showing an active role played by 
Appellant which has abated the commission of 
suicide. Further, the dwelling house was jointly 
purchased by the Appellant and the deceased 
and therefore there was no question of insisting 
to transfer the house in the name of Appellant. 
Neither the deceased, nor his family members 
have raised the grievance against alleged 
harassment before the authorities, until the 
suicide. Thus, the appellant states that all 
allegations are fake and frivolous.  
6. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the 
respondent submitted that the ingredients 
essential for the offence under Section 306 IPC 
were clearly made out from the evidence collected 
during the investigation and as such the High 
Court has rightly dismissed the petition. 
7. 
Having heard the arguments of both the counsels 
and after perusing the record, we find that the 
only question that needs to be determined in the 
instant case is whether the alleged conduct of the 
appellant-accused prima facie attracts Section 

SLP(Crl.) No. 13246 of 2023 
 
Page 7 of 12 
 
306 of IPC, to continue the proceedings of Trial 
Court against the appellant.  
Section 306 and Section 107 of IPC read as: 
“306. Abetment of suicide- 
If any person commits suicide, whoever 
abets the commission of such suicide, 
shall be punished with imprisonment of 
either description for a term which may 
extend to ten years, and shall also be 
liable to fine. 
 
It must be read with Section 107 of IPC 
which 
explains 
the 
meaning 
of 
Abetment, which reads as: 
 
107. Abetment of a thing- 
 
A person abets the doing of a thing, 
who— 
First.—Instigates any person to do that 
thing; or 
 
Secondly.—Engages with one or more 
other person or persons in any conspiracy 
for the doing of that thing, if an act or 
illegal omission takes place in pursuance 
of that conspiracy, and in order to the 
doing of that thing; or 
 
Thirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or 
illegal omission, the doing of that thing. 
 
Explanation 1.—A person who, by wilful 
misrepresentation, 
or 
by 
wilful 
concealment of a material fact which he is 
bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or 
procures, or attempts to cause or procure, 

SLP(Crl.) No. 13246 of 2023 
 
Page 8 of 12 
 
a thing to be done, is said to instigate the 
doing of that thing. 
 
Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to 
or at the time of the commission of an act, 
does anything in order to facilitate the 
commission of that act, and thereby 
facilitates the commission thereof, is said 
to aid the doing of that act.” 
 
8. 
Reading these sections together would indicate 
that there must be either an instigation, or an 
engagement or intentional aid to ‘doing of a 
thing’. When we apply these three criteria to 
Section 306, it means that the accused must 
have encouraged the person to commit suicide or 
engaged in conspiracy with others to encourage 
the person to commit suicide or acted (or failed 
to act) intentionally to aid the person to commit 
suicide.  
 
9. 
In S.S. Chheena v. Vijay Kumar Mahajan2, this 
court explained the concept of abetment along 
with necessary ingredient for offence under 
Section 306 of IPC as under: 
 
“25. Abetment involves a mental process 
of instigating a person or intentionally 
aiding a person in doing of a thing. 
Without a positive act on the part of the 
 
2 (2010) 12 SCC 190 

SLP(Crl.) No. 13246 of 2023 
 
Page 9 of 12 
 
accused to instigate or aid in committing 
suicide, conviction cannot be sustained. 
The intention of the legislature and the 
ratio of the cases decided by this Court 
is clear that in order to convict a person 
under Section 306 IPC there has to be a 
clear mens rea to commit the offence. It 
also requires an active act or direct act 
which led the deceased to commit 
suicide seeing no option and that act 
must have been intended to push the 
deceased into such a position that he 
committed suicide.” 
 
10. In Amalendu Pal v. State of W.B.3, this court 
explained the parameters of Section 306 in 
following words: 
 
“12. Thus, this Court has consistently 
taken the view that before holding an 
accused guilty of an offence under 
Section 306 IPC, the court must 
scrupulously examine the facts and 
circumstances of the case and also 
assess the evidence adduced before it in 
order to find out whether the cruelty and 
harassment meted out to the victim had 
left the victim with no other alternative 
but to put an end to her life. It is also to 
be borne in mind that in cases of alleged 
abetment of suicide there must be proof 
of direct or indirect acts of incitement to 
the commission of suicide. Merely on the 
allegation of harassment without there 
being any positive action proximate to 
the time of occurrence on the part of the 
 
3 (2010) 1 SCC 707 

SLP(Crl.) No. 13246 of 2023 
 
Page 10 of 12 
 
accused which led or compelled the 
person to commit suicide, conviction in 
terms of Section 306 IPC is not 
sustainable. 
 
13. In order to bring a case within the 
purview of Section 306 IPC there must 
be a case of suicide and in the 
commission of the said offence, the 
person who is said to have abetted the 
commission of suicide must have played 
an active role by an act of instigation or 
by doing certain act to facilitate the 
commission of suicide. Therefore, the act 
of abetment by the person charged with 
the said offence must be proved and 
established by the prosecution before he 
could be convicted under Section 306 
IPC.” 
 
11. In Ramesh Kumar v. State of Chhattisgarh4, 
while explaining the meaning of ‘Instigation’, this 
court stated that: 
 
“20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, 
provoke, incite or encourage to do “an 
act”. To satisfy the requirement of 
“instigation”, though it is not necessary 
that actual words must be used to that 
effect or what constitutes “instigation” 
must necessarily and specifically be 
suggestive of the consequence. Yet a 
reasonable 
certainty 
to 
incite 
the 
consequence must be capable of being 
spelt out. Where the accused had, by his 
acts or omission or by a continued 
 
4 (2001) 9 SCC 618.  

SLP(Crl.) No. 13246 of 2023 
 
Page 11 of 12 
 
course 
of 
conduct, 
created 
such 
circumstances that the deceased was left 
with no other option except to commit 
suicide, in which case, an “instigation” 
may have to be inferred. A word uttered 
in a fit of anger or emotion without 
intending the consequences to actually 
follow, cannot be said to be instigation.” 
 
12. These principles and necessary ingredients of 
Section 306 and 107 of Indian Penal Code were 
reiterated and summarized by this court in 
recent case of Gurucharan Singh vs State of 
Punjab5. 
 
13. After carefully considering the facts and evidence 
recorded by the courts below and the legal 
position established through statutory and 
judicial pronouncements, we are of the view that 
there is no proximate link between the marital 
dispute in the marriage of deceased with 
appellant and the commission of suicide. The 
prosecution has failed to collect any evidence to 
substantiate 
the 
allegations 
against 
the 
appellant. The appellant has not played any 
active role or any positive or direct act to instigate 
or aid the deceased in committing suicide. 
Neither the statement of the complainant nor 
 
5 (2020) 10 SCC 200.  

SLP(Crl.) No. 13246 of 2023 
 
Page 12 of 12 
 
that of the colleagues of the deceased as recorded 
by the Investigating Officer during investigation 
suggest any kind of instigation by the appellant 
to abet the commission of suicide. There is no 
allegation against the appellant of suggesting the 
deceased to commit suicide at any time prior to 
the commission of suicide by her husband. 
 
14. Thus, none of the three essentials of Section 107 
read with Section 306 IPC are existing.  
 
15. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. Impugned 
order of the High Court is set aside. The 
application for discharge is allowed.
