3. 
In K. Arumugam vs. Union of India, C.A. No. 2842-2848 of 
2012, the facts are that the appellant is registered with the 
Directorate of State Lotteries in Thiruvananthapuram and has 
purchased Kerala State Lotteries from the District Lottery 
Offices and other States' lotteries in bulk from registered 
promoters at a discounted rate. The appellant contends that 
this purchase was made on an outright sale basis, meaning, 
they bought all tickets in bulk with no return policy ("all sold 
basis") and subsequently sold them to retailers, also on an 
outright sale basis. A profit was made from the difference 
between the amount received from retailers and the amount 
paid to the State Government or registered promoters. The sale 
of lotteries in Kerala was regulated by the Kerala State Lotteries 
and Online Lotteries (Regulation) Rules, 2003 framed under 
Section 12(3) of the Lotteries Regulation Act, 1998 and the 
Kerala Tax on Paper Lotteries Act, 2005. 
3.1 Appellant was directed by the Superintendent of Central 
Excise, Service Tax Range, Palakkad Division, Mettuppalayam 
Street, Palakkad-1, Kerala, to obtain registration and pay 

 
 
Page 3 of 25 
 
service tax under the heading 'business auxiliary service' in 
terms 
of 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Finance 
Act, 
1994. 
Subsequently, the appellants were served notices by the 
Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise demanding details 
of their lottery purchase since the year 2003. In some 
instances, searches were conducted and items, including hard 
discs, were seized.  
3.2  As a result, the appellant approached the Kerala High 
Court challenging the constitutionality of the Explanation 
added to Section 65 (19) (ii) of the Finance Act, 1994 and all 
consequential steps taken in pursuance thereto. The appellant 
argued that the profit made from the difference between the 
purchase price and the face value of the tickets did not 
constitute a ‘taxable service’ under the relevant provision. It 
was argued that the activities did not constitute a ‘taxable 
service’.  It was also conjunctively argued that the Explanation 
inserted in the year 2008 introduced a new concept 
inconsistent with the main provision and that no service tax 
could be imposed based on this Court's ruling in Sunrise 
Associates vs. Govt. of NCT of Delhi, (2006) 5 SCC 603 

 
 
Page 4 of 25 
 
(“Sunrise Associates”) wherein it was held that lottery tickets 
are not goods but actionable claims.  However, the High Court 
of Kerala dismissed the petitions on 19.08.2011. Aggrieved by 
the aforesaid judgment, present appeals are preferred. 
3.3  In the case of Tashi Delek Gaming Sol. Pvt. Ltd. & Anr vs. 
Union of India & Ors., C.A. No.2781 of 2012, the appellant has 
impugned the judgment of the Sikkim High Court, which 
dismissed the appellant’s writ petition challenging the 
constitutional validity of the Explanation to Section 65(19)(ii) 
introduced by the Finance Act, 2008 with effect from 
16.05.2008. The appellant in this case was appointed as the 
exclusive statutory marketing agent by the State of Sikkim on 
24.08.2001, under Section 4(c) of the Lotteries Regulation Act, 
1998, for the sale of online lottery tickets organized by the said 
State. According to the agreement between the appellant and 
the State of Sikkim, the appellant purchased lottery tickets in 
bulk from the Directorate of Lotteries at a price lower than the 
maximum retail price (MRP). The appellant then sold the 
tickets to distributors, adding a margin of 1%, who in turn sold 
the tickets to retailers, who ultimately sold them to the public 

 
 
Page 5 of 25 
 
at the MRP. 
3.4  A letter dated 07.07.2009 was issued to the appellant 
herein by the Office of the Superintendent of Central Excise, 
Gangtok Range, Gangtok, Government of India requesting the 
appellant to submit an application Form ST-1 seeking service 
tax registration under the category "business auxiliary service" 
as the service rendered by the appellant came within the ambit 
of "business auxiliary service" in terms of the Explanation to 
Section 65(19)(ii) of the Finance Act, 2008 and therefore, the 
appellant was liable to pay service tax.  
Aggrieved by the aforesaid communication dated 
07.07.2009, a writ petition, being W.P.(C) No.21 of 2009 was 
filed by the petitioner before the High Court of Sikkim at 
Gangtok, challenging the constitutionality of the letter dated 
07.07.2009 as well as the Explanation to Section 65(19)(ii) 
inserted by the Finance Act, 2008. Vide impugned judgment 
dated 03.07.2010, the High Court of Sikkim dismissed the writ 
petition filed by the appellant herein.  
3.5  The appellant maintained that the sale of lottery tickets 
is, in fact, an outright purchase and does not involve any 

 
 
Page 6 of 25 
 
service to the State in terms of promotion or marketing under 
the Explanation to Section 65(19)(ii) of the Finance Act, 1994 
as amended by the Finance Act, 2008. The tickets sold were 
mainly for lotteries organized by the States of Kerala and 
Sikkim as well as the Government of Bhutan. 
3.6  The Union of India, on the other hand, argued that the 
appellants, in addition to selling the tickets, provided a service 
to the State by marketing and promoting lotteries, as evidenced 
by the Agreement, including modifications and additions 
thereto, between the appellant and the State of Sikkim dated 
24.08.2001, 09.12.2003, and 18.11.2005. It was contended 
that the appellant was not merely engaged in outright sale of 
lottery tickets simpliciter but rendered expansive services. The 
Union sought to explain that the appellant herein issued 
advertisements, had a right to be consulted in respect of design 
of a lottery ticket, had a say in the matter of arranging and 
organizing the lottery, had been authorized to promote and 
market the online lottery and paid minimum assured revenue 
of rupees Ten crores per annum to the State of Sikkim. 

 
 
Page 7 of 25 
 
3.7  It would be relevant to observe that these appellants 
were/are all carrying on the business of buying and selling of 
lottery tickets. They purchased the lottery tickets from the 
State Governments which organized the lotteries and sold the 
same in various other States or in the States where the lottery 
business was organized, through stockists and distributors. 
  
3.8  The Central Government sought to levy service tax on the 
premise that the activity which the appellants were/are 
carrying on was a business auxiliary service within the 
definition of Section 65(19) of the Finance Act, 1994 and 
therefore, chargeable to service tax.  The same was resisted by 
these appellants by filing writ petitions before the High Courts. 
 
3.9  Both the High Courts of Sikkim as well as Kerala have 
held against these appellants and have opined that service tax 
is leviable on their activity under the nomenclature of business 
auxiliary service. Hence these appeals.  
4. 
We have heard learned senior counsel Sri S. Ganesh and 
learned counsel Sri A. R. Madhav Rao for the appellants and 
learned senior counsel Sri Arijit Prasad and learned counsel 

 
 
Page 8 of 25 
 
for the respondent – Union of India and perused the material 
on record. 
 
Points for consideration:  
5. 
Having heard learned counsel for the respective sides, the 
following questions arise for our consideration: 
1. Whether the activity of the appellants – 
assessees would attract service tax within 
the scope and ambit of Section 65(19)(ii) 
read with Section 65(105)(zzb) of the 
Finance Act, 1994?  If not, what relief(s) 
the appellants are entitled to? 
2. What Order?   
 
 
6. 
In order to better understand the controversy in these 
cases, it would be relevant to advert to the provisions of the 
Constitution as well as the provisions of the Finance Act, 1994 
(which imposes service tax, pertinently on business auxiliary 
service). 
6.1  Article 246 of the Constitution pertains to the division of 
subjects 
between 
the 
Central 
(Parliament) 
and 
State 
Legislatures in the form of three lists in the Seventh Schedule 

 
 
Page 9 of 25 
 
of the Constitution, namely List 1 – Union List, List 2 – State 
List and List 3 – Concurrent List.  It would be useful to extract 
Article 246 of the Constitution as under: 
“246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and 
by the Legislatures of States. 
 
(1) Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) 
and (3), Parliament has exclusive power to 
make laws with respect to any of the 
matters enumerated in List I in the 
Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution 
referred to as the “Union List”). 
 
(2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), 
Parliament, and, subject to clause (1), the 
Legislature of any State also, have power to 
make laws with respect to any of the 
matters enumerated in List III in the 
Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution 
referred to as the “Concurrent List”). 
 
(3) Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the 
Legislature of any State has exclusive 
power to make laws for such State or any 
part thereof with respect to any of the 
matters enumerated in List II in the 
Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution 
referred to as the “State List”). 
 
(4) Parliament has power to make laws with 
respect to any matter for any part of the 
territory of India not included in a State 
notwithstanding that such matter is a 
matter enumerated in the State List.” 
 
 

 
 
Page 10 of 25 
 
6.2  Article 248 deals with Residuary power of Legislatures 
and the same reads as under: 
“248. Residuary powers of legislation. 
 
(1) Subject to Article 246A, Parliament has 
exclusive power to make any law with 
respect to any matter not enumerated in 
the Concurrent List or State List. 
 
(2) Such power shall include the power of 
making any law imposing a tax not 
mentioned in either of those Lists.” 
 
 
 
At this stage itself, it may be mentioned that the residuary 
power is reserved to the Parliament to legislate on any subject 
provided such power is not included in either the Concurrent 
List or the State List. 
 
6.3  The Finance Act, 1994 was legislated by the Parliament 
in terms of Article 248 of the Constitution of India read with 
Entry 97 List 1 which reads as under: 
“97. Any other matter not enumerated in List II or List 
III including any tax not mentioned in either of those 
Lists.” 
 
 
It is also pertinent to mention that Entry 92-C of List I 
which deals with taxes on services was inserted by the 

 
 
Page 11 of 25 
 
Constitution (Eighty-eighth Amendment) Act, 2003, but was 
not notified and was omitted by the Constitution (One Hundred 
and First Amendment) Act, 2016 with effect from 16.09.2016. 
In the circumstances, we observe that the Finance Act, 1994 
is relatable to Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the 
Constitution. Subsequently, vide the same Constitution (One 
Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016, Article 246A was 
inserted as special provision with respect to goods and services 
tax.  
 
6.4  For the sake of completion, it would also be relevant to 
refer to Entries 33 and 34 List II. Entry 62 List II (State List) as 
it stood then, deals with taxes on luxuries including taxes on 
entertainment, amusement, betting and gambling, etc. The 
said Entry has subsequently been amended with effect from 
16.09.2016. However, it is not necessary to extract the 
amended Entry as these appeals pertain to the period prior to 
01.07.2010.  Entries 33 and 34 of List II are the regulatory 
Entries, which read as under: 
“33.  Theaters and dramatic performances; cinemas 
subject to the provisions of entry 60 of List I; 

 
 
Page 12 of 25 
 
sports, entertainments and amusements. 
 
34.  
Betting and gambling.” 
 
 
6.5  Reverting to the Finance Act, 1994 and particularly 
Chapter V which deals with Service Tax, the following 
provisions, which are relevant for the purpose of this 
controversy, could be extracted as under: 
“65.  Definitions.—In this Chapter, unless the context 
otherwise requires.— 
xxx 
65(19) “business auxiliary service” means any 
service in relation to,— 
 
(i) promotion or marketing or sale of goods produced

whether or not conducted online, including 
lottery, lotto, bingo; 
 
(iii) any customer care service provided on behalf of 
the client; or 
 

 
 
Page 13 of 25 
 
(iv) procurement of goods or services, which are 
inputs for the client; or 
 
Explanation.- For the removal of doubts, it is 
hereby declared that for the purposes of this 
sub-clause, “inputs” means all goods or services 
intended for use by the client; 
 
(v) production or processing of goods for, or on behalf 
of the client; or

does not include any activity that amounts to 
“manufacture” of excisable goods.

 6.6  It is relevant to note that Section 65(50) of the Finance 
Act, 1994 defines goods to have the same meaning assigned to 
it under Clause (7) of Section 2 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930.  
Clause (7) of Section 2 of the Sales of Goods Act, 1930,  reads 
as under: 
 
“2. Definitions.—In this Act, unless there is anything 
repugnant in the subject or context,— 
xxx 
(7) “goods” means every kind of moveable property 

 
 
Page 15 of 25 
 
other than actionable claims and money; and includes 
stock and shares, growing crops, grass, and things 
attached to or forming part of the land which are 
agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract 
of sale;” 
 
(underlining by us) 
 
 
6.7  In the case of Sunrise Associates, the Constitution 
Bench of this Court speaking through Ruma Pal, J., opined 
that lottery tickets can be categorized as actionable claims. The 
relevant paragraphs of the said judgment read as under: 
“40. An actionable claim would include a right to 
recover insurance money or a partner's right to sue for 
an account of a dissolved partnership or the right to 
claim the benefit of a contract not coupled with any 
liability 
(see Union 
of 
India v. Sri 
Sarada 
Mills 
Ltd. [(1972) 2 SCC 877] , SCC at p. 880). A claim for 
arrears of rent has also been held to be an actionable 
claim 
(State 
of 
Bihar v. Maharajadhiraja 
Sir 
Kameshwar Singh [(1952) 1 SCC 528 : 1952 SCR 889 : 
AIR 1952 SC 252] , SCR at p. 910). A right to the credit 
in a provident fund account has also been held to be 
an 
actionable 
claim 
(Official 
Trustee v. L. 
Chippendale [AIR 1944 Cal 335 : ILR (1943) 2 Cal 
325] ; Bhupati Mohan Das v. Phanindra Chandra 
Chakravarty [AIR 1935 Cal 756 : 40 CWN 102] ). In 
our opinion a sale of a lottery ticket also amounts to 
the transfer of an actionable claim. 
 
41. A lottery ticket has no value in itself. It is a mere 
piece of paper. Its value lies in the fact that it 
represents a chance or a right to a conditional benefit 
of winning a prize of a greater value than the 

 
 
Page 16 of 25 
 
consideration paid for the transfer of that chance. It is 
nothing more than a token or evidence of this right. 
The Court in H. Anraj [(1986) 1 SCC 414 : 1986 SCC 
(Tax) 190] , as we have seen, held that a lottery ticket 
is a slip of paper or memoranda evidencing the 
transfer of certain rights. We agree. 
 
42.Webster's Words and Phrases, Permanent Edn., 
Vol. 25-A Supplement defines a “ticket” as “a printed 
card or a piece of paper that gives a person a specific 
right, as to attend a theatre, ride on a train, claim or 
purchase, etc.” The Madras High Court in Sesha 
Ayyar v. Krishna Ayyar [AIR 1936 Mad 225 : ILR 59 
Mad 562 (FB)] also held: (AIR p. 227) 
 
“Tickets of course are only the tokens of the 
chance purchased, and it is the purchase of 
this chance which is the essence of a lottery.” 
 
43. The sale of a ticket does not necessarily involve the 
sale of goods. For example, the purchase of a railway 
ticket gives the right to a person to travel by railway. 
It is nothing other than a contract of carriage. The 
actual ticket is merely evidence of the right to travel. A 
contract is not property, but only a promise supported 
by consideration, upon breach of which either a claim 
for specific performance or damages would lie 
(Said v. Butt [(1920) 3 KB 497 : 1920 All ER Rep 232] ). 
Like railway tickets, a ticket to see a cinema or a 
pawnbroker's ticket are memoranda or contracts 
between the vendors of the ticket and the purchasers. 
Cases on whether the terms specified on such tickets 
bind the purchaser are legion. It is sufficient for our 
purpose to note that tickets are themselves, normally 
evidence of and in some cases the contract between 
the buyer of the ticket and its seller. Therefore a lottery 
ticket can be held to be goods if at all only because it 
evidences the transfer of a right. 
 

 
 
Page 17 of 25 
 
44. The question is, what is this right which the ticket 
represents? There can be no doubt that on purchasing 
a lottery ticket, the purchaser would have a claim to a 
conditional interest in the prize money which is not in 
the purchaser's possession. The right would fall 
squarely within the definition of an actionable claim 
and would therefore be excluded from the definition of 
“goods” under the Sale of Goods Act and the sales tax 
statutes. This was also accepted in H. Anraj [(1986) 1 
SCC 414 : 1986 SCC (Tax) 190] when the Court said 
that to the extent that the sale of a lottery ticket 
involved a transfer of the right to claim a prize 
depending on chance, it was an assignment of an 
actionable 
claim. 
Significantly 
in B.R. 
Enterprises v. State of U.P. [(1999) 9 SCC 700] 
construing H. Anraj [(1986) 1 SCC 414 : 1986 SCC 
(Tax) 190] the Court said: (SCC p. 746, para 52) 
 
“52. So, we find three ingredients in the sale 
of lottery tickets, namely, (i) prize, (ii) chance, 
and 
(iii) 
consideration. 
So, 
when 
one 
purchases a lottery ticket, he purchases for a 
prize, 
which 
is 
by 
chance 
and 
the 
consideration is the price of the ticket.” 
 
xxx 
 
51. We are therefore of the view that the decision in H. 
Anraj [(1986) 1 SCC 414 : 1986 SCC (Tax) 190] 
incorrectly held that a sale of a lottery ticket involved 
a sale of goods. There was no sale of goods within the 
meaning of Sales Tax Acts of the different States but 
at the highest a transfer of an actionable claim. The 
decision to the extent that it held otherwise is 
accordingly overruled though prospectively with effect 
from the date of this judgment.” 
 
6.8  On a reading of clause (19) of Section 65 of the Finance 

 
 
Page 18 of 25 
 
Act, 1994 and on analyzing the same, it is evident that tax on 
a business auxiliary service is relatable to (i) any service 
concerning promotion or marketing or sale of goods, produced 
or provided by, or belonging to the client and (ii) promotion or 
marketing of service provided by the client. 
6.9  The definition of goods has also been noted in clause (50) 
of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994 which refers to clause 
(7) of Section 2 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930.  The expression 
“goods” under the Sale of Goods Act expressly excludes 
actionable claims as well as money. This Court in Sunrise 
Associates has held that lottery tickets are actionable claims. 
Therefore, as lottery tickets would not come within the 
meaning of the expression goods under clause (7) of Section 2 
of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, they would also not come within 
the scope and ambit of clause (50) of Section 65 of the Finance 
Act, 1994.  If that is so, they would also not come within the 
scope and ambit of clause (19)(i) of Section 65 of the Finance 
Act, 1994. Lottery tickets being actionable claims and not 
being goods within the meaning of sub-clause (i) of clause (19) 
of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994, would expressly get 

 
 
Page 19 of 25 
 
excluded from the scope of the said provision. In the 
circumstances, service tax on the promotion or marketing or 
sale of lottery tickets which are actionable claims could not 
have been levied under the said sub-clause.  
6.10  In order to remove the doubt whether service tax could be 
levied on promotion or marketing or sale of lottery tickets 
under Clause 19(ii) of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994, an 
Explanation was added with effect from 16.05.2008. The 
Explanation has also been extracted above. Although the 
Explanation is for the purpose of removal of doubts, it is 
relevant to note that what is excluded in sub-clause (i) of 
clause (19) of Section 65 of the Act, namely lotteries being 
actionable claim and not goods, as analysed above, is sought 
to be mentioned as lottery per se in the Explanation. Thus, 
when lottery ticket is an actionable claim and not “goods” and 
is therefore outside the scope of sub-clause (i) of clause 19 of 
Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994, it could not have been 
included as lottery per se in the Explanation to sub-clause (ii) 
of Clause 19 of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994 as “service 
in relation to promotion or marketing of service provided by the 

 
 
Page 20 of 25 
 
client” including any service provided in relation to promotion 
or marketing of games of chance, organized, conducted or 
promoted by the client, in whatever form or by whatever name 
called, whether or not conducted online, including lottery, 
lotto, bingo.  
The Explanation sought to bring the activity of sale of 
lottery tickets within sub-clause (ii) of Clause 19 of Section 65 
of the Finance Act, 1994, when it was excluded from sub-
clause (i) on account of the lottery tickets being interpreted as 
actionable claims and not goods on the premise that it was a 
service within the meaning of said sub-clause. On a plain 
reading of the Explanation in light of the activity actually 
carried on by the appellant(s)-assessee(s) herein, it becomes 
clear that the outright purchase of lottery tickets from the 
promoters of the State or Directorate of Lotteries, as the case 
may be, is not a service in relation to promotion or marketing 
of service provided by the client, i.e., the State conducting the 
lottery. The conduct of lottery is a revenue generating activity 
by a State or any other entity in the field of actionable claims. 
The client, i.e., the State is not engaging in an activity of service

while dealing with the business of lottery. Explanation to sub-
clause (ii) of Clause 19 of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994 
cannot bring within sub-clause (ii) by assuming an activity 
which was initially sought to be covered under sub-clause (i) 
thereof but could not be by virtue of the definition of goods 
under the very same Act read with Section 2(7) of the Sale of 
Goods Act, 1930.  The mere insertion of an explanation cannot 
make an activity a taxable service when it is not covered under 
the main provision (which has to be read into the said sub-
clause by virtue of the legislative device of express 
incorporation).  This is because sale of lottery tickets is not a 
service in relation to promotion or marketing of service 
provided by a client, i.e., the State in the instant case. 
Conducting a lottery which is a game of chance is ex facie a 
privilege and an activity conducted by the State and not a 
service being rendered by the State. The said activity would 
have a profit motive and is for the purpose of earning additional 
revenue to the State exchequer. The activity is carried out by 
sale of lottery tickets to persons, such as the assessees herein, 
on an outright basis and once the lottery tickets are sold and 

 
 
Page 22 of 25 
 
the amount collected, there is no further relationship between 
the assessees herein and the State in respect of the lottery 
tickets sold. The burden is on the assessees herein to further 
sell the lottery tickets to the divisional / regional stockists for 
a profit as their business activity. This activity is not a 
promotion or a marketing service rendered by the assessees 
herein to the State within the meaning of sub-clause (ii) of 
Clause 19 of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994. This is 
because, to reiterate, the States are not rendering a service but 
engaged in the activity of conducting lottery to earn additional 
revenue. Moreover, once the lottery tickets are sold by the 
Directorate of Lotteries—a Department of the State, there is 
transfer of the title of the lottery tickets to the appellants, who, 
as owners of the said lottery tickets, in turn sell them to 
stockists and others.  Thus, there is no promotion of the 
business of the State as its agent.  Thus, there is no 
‘principal—agent’ relationship which would normally be the 
case in a relationship where a business auxiliary service is 
rendered.  The relationship between the State and the 
appellants is on a principal to principal basis.  Thus, there is 

 
 
Page 23 of 25 
 
no activity of promotion or marketing of a service on behalf of 
the State.  Neither is the State, which conducts the lottery, 
rendering a service within the meaning of the Finance Act, 
1994. 
The Explanation, therefore, cannot over-ride the main 
text of the provision as the Explanation which was sought to 
remove doubts is in fact contrary to the main provision which 
defines business auxiliary service and also contrary to the 
judgment of this Court in Sunrise Associates and having 
regard to clause (50) of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994. 
No doubt the Explanation was omitted with effect from 
01.07.2010. However, these cases pertain to the period prior 
to 01.07.2010. Therefore, either under sub-clause (i) of clause 
(19) of Section 65 or under the Explanation to sub-clause (ii) 
of Clause 19 of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994, after it 
was introduced with effect from 16.05.2008 and until it was 
omitted, service tax could not have been levied on the 
promotion or marketing of sale of goods or service provided by 
the client, on the premise that it was a ‘business auxiliary 
service’.

7. 
The High Courts have lost sight of the definition of ‘goods’ 
in clause (50) of Section 65 of the Act while interpreting the 
expression “lottery”. As already noted, the definition of ‘goods’ 
in clause (7) of Section 2 of Sale of Goods Act, 1930, that is 
expressly incorporated in clause (50) of Section 65 of the Act, 
which expressly excludes actionable claims. This Court has by 
the Constitution Bench in Sunrise Associates opined that 
lottery tickets are actionable claims. The High Courts have also 
lost sight of the fact that the sale of lottery tickets by the State 
is a privileged activity by itself and not rendering of a service 
for which the assessees are rendering promotion or marketing 
service.  
8. 
In view of the above discussion, the appeals filed by the 
appellants-assessees are liable to be allowed and are allowed 
by setting aside the impugned judgments of the High Courts of 
Sikkim and Kerala. 
9. 
Having regard to the mandate of Article 265 of the 
Constitution of India, the appeals are allowed with all 
consequential reliefs to the appellants.

10. It is needless to observe that if any representations are 
made seeking refund of the amounts paid, the same shall be 
considered expeditiously by the concerned departments of the 
respondents. 
In the facts and circumstances of these matters, there will 
be no order as to costs.
