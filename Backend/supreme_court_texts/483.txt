Appellate Court was partly upheld and partly set aside. 
2. 
Relevant facts in brief giving rise to the present 
appeals are as under: 
(a). Beli Ram was the owner in possession of the land 
in dispute. Tota Ram, plaintiff is the nephew of Beli Ram, 
being his brother's son. According to the plaintiff, he had 
been cultivating the land in question for more than three 
decades and had also been taking care of Beli Ram. In 
1988, out of natural love and affection, Beli Ram 
executed a registered Will dated 12.12.1988 bequeathing 
the suit land in favour of the plaintiff Tota Ram. Beli Ram 
died on 11.07.1994. As the plaintiff had continued in 
possession from the time when Beli Ram was alive, he 
remained in possession even after death of Beli Ram. 
However, as the defendant started interfering with the 
possession of the suit land, the plaintiff made enquiry 
and he came to know that defendant no.1, Vikram Singh, 
on the basis of another Will dated 16.05.1994 had got 
his name mutated in the revenue records vide mutation 
Entry No.201. Further, Vikram Singh had transferred 

Civil Appeal No. 8187 of 2023 
 
Page 3 of 14 
 
the land in suit in favour of defendant no.2, Smt. Saroj 
Kumari and also defendant nos.4 and 5, Pankaj Kumar 
and Pawan Kumar respectively. 
(b) 
In view of the interference in possession, Tota Ram 
instituted a suit for a decree of declaration with 
consequential relief of permanent prohibitory injunction 
that he was the owner in possession of land in dispute 
and that the defendants had no right or title to it. It was 
further prayed that the mutation Entry No.201 dated 
17.01.1996 and Entry No. 207 dated 07.06.1996 should 
also be declared as false, fictitious and illegal.  
(c). In the plaint, Vikram Singh was impleaded as 
defendant no.1., Smt. Saroj Kumari as defendant no.2, 
Pankaj Kumar and Pawan Kumar as defendant Nos.4 
and 5. Defendant no.3, Smt. Dharni Devi, being daughter 
of Beli Ram was also impleaded but no relief was claimed 
against her as she had not put up any claim with respect 
to the property of Beli Ram including the land in suit. 
According to the plaint allegations, Beli Ram had 
executed the Will in sound mind and good health, out of 

Civil Appeal No. 8187 of 2023 
 
Page 4 of 14 
 
love and affection on 12.12.1988 in favour of the plaintiff, 
who had been taking care of Beli Ram throughout and 
had also been cultivating the land in suit for the last 
more than 30 years. It was further stated that the second 
Will dated 16.05.1994, set up by defendant no.1 was 
forged and fictitious and surrounded with suspicion, as 
such, it did not confer any right, title or interest upon the 
defendant no.1 or the vendees through him i.e. 
Defendant nos.2, 4 and 5. 
(d). The defendants contested the suit and filed their 
written statements and led evidence. Defendant Nos.4 
and 5 filed a separate written statement. They denied the 
plaint allegations and stated that the Will dated 
16.05.1994 was a genuine document voluntarily 
executed by Beli Ram in a healthy and disposing mind 
and the same was duly registered. The Will dated 
12.12.1988 was denied. According to them, the entries 
in the revenue records were made after due verification. 
They also claimed to be in possession of the land 
purchased by them. Separate written statements were 

Civil Appeal No. 8187 of 2023 
 
Page 5 of 14 
 
filed by defendant nos.1 and 2 on same lines as of 
defendants 4 and 5. Dharni Devi, Defendant no.3, filed a 
written statement admitting the claim of the plaintiff and 
also the Will dated 12.12.1988. 
4. 
The Trial Court framed 12 issues which read as 
follows: 
“1.

of the suit land as alleged? 
2.

Relief.” 
 
5. 
Before the Trial Court, the plaintiff-Tota Ram 
examined three witnesses and placed on record the Will 
dated 12.12.1988, which he duly proved and was 
marked as Ext. DW-2/(A). 
6. 
On the other hand, the defendants examined five 
witnesses and also proved their Will dated 16.05.1994, 
which was marked as Ext.DW-3/(A). The Trial Court 
recorded the following findings on the issues as 
incorporated in paragraph 7 of the judgment, which are

judgment. 
 
7. 
On the above findings, the Trial Court, vide 
judgment dated 30.09.2004, dismissed the suit. 
8. 
Aggrieved by the same, plaintiff-Tota Ram preferred 
an appeal under Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908 before the District Judge, Hamirpur, which was 
registered as Civil Appeal No.110 of 2004. The appellate 
Court framed point for determination as to whether the 
judgment and decree under appeal is legally sustainable 
and to what relief if any, the appellant would be entitled 
to. The District Judge did not agree with the findings and 
the conclusions of the Trial Court and, accordingly, 
decreed the suit against defendants 1, 2, 4 and 5. It held 

Civil Appeal No. 8187 of 2023 
 
Page 8 of 14 
 
that the Will dated 12.12.1988 was a valid and genuine 
document and plaintiff was entitled to a declaration on 
the basis of the same, that he was in possession of the 
land in question and accordingly injuncted the 
defendants 1, 2, 4 and 5 from interfering in his 
possession. It further found that the Will dated 
16.05.1994 
was 
surrounded 
with 
suspicious 
circumstances and as such could not be relied upon. It 
was held to be an invalid document. It also set aside the 
mutation Entry Nos.201 and 207. 
9. 
Aggrieved by the judgment of the first appellate 
Court, the defendants preferred Second Appeal under 
Section 100 of CPC, which was registered as RSA No.392 
of 2005 before the High Court of Himachal Pradesh. The 
High Court confirmed the finding of the First Appellate 
Court that the Will dated 12.12.1988 was a valid and 
genuine document. It also found that the second Will 
dated 16.05.1994 in favour of defendant no.1, Vikram 
Singh was not a genuine document and was shrouded 
with suspicion. However, the High Court felt that the 

Civil Appeal No. 8187 of 2023 
 
Page 9 of 14 
 
purchasers from defendant no.1 were entitled to benefit 
of Section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act, 18821 and, 
accordingly, saved the transactions in their favour. They 
were entitled to retain the land covered under their 
respective sale deeds and the remaining land covered 
under the Will, would stand declared in the ownership of 
the plaintiff, Tota Ram and that the defendant no.1, 
Vikram Singh would not be entitled to claim any such 
benefit over the remaining land. The High Court also set 
aside the mutation Entry No.201 but saved it with 
respect to the transfers made in favour of defendants 2, 
4 and 5. It further restored the mutation Entry No.207 
in favour of defendant Nos.2, 4 and 5. 
10. Aggrieved by the same, the legal heirs of Tota Ram 
i.e. his three sons, three daughters and widow have filed 
Civil Appeal No.8187 of 2023 to challenge the judgment 
of the High Court to the extent it saved the transactions 
in favour of defendants 2, 4 & 5. The other Civil Appeal 
 
1 In short, TP Act 

Civil Appeal No. 8187 of 2023 
 
Page 10 of 14 
 
No.8188 of 2023 has been filed by Vikram Singh 
(defendant no.1) with respect to the declaration of his 
Will dated 16.05.1994 to be an invalid document 
shrouded with suspicion. 
11. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. On 
behalf of the plaintiffs-appellants, the submission is that 
the High Court fell in serious error in extending the 
benefit of Section 41 of the TP Act to the defendants 2, 4 
and 5. Neither there was any specific pleading, nor any 
issue framed, nor any evidence led with respect to such 
relief. None of the purchasers namely defendants 2, 4 
and 5 entered the witness box. The High Court has 
carved out a completely new case which is unsustainable 
in law. 
12. Section 41 of the TP Act reads as follows: 
 
“41. Transfer by ostensible owner. 
Where, with the consent, express or implied, of the 
persons interested in immoveable property, a person 
is the ostensible owner of such property and 
transfers the same for consideration, the transfer 
shall not be voidable on the ground that the 

Civil Appeal No. 8187 of 2023 
 
Page 11 of 14 
 
transferor was not authorised to make it:  
provided that the transferee, after taking reasonable 
care to ascertain that the transferor had power to 
make the transfer, has acted in good faith.” 
 
A plain reading of the above provision clearly requires the 
consent, be it express or implied, of the persons 
interested in the immovable property.  
13. In the present case, the plaintiff, Tota Ram, was 
definitely interested in the immovable property having a 
registered will of 1988 in his favour and we do not find 
either in the pleadings or in the evidence, that he had 
given, his consent, expressly or impliedly, to Vikram 
Singh, defendant no.1, to transfer the property, in favour 
of defendant nos. 2, 4 and 5. Nowhere in the written 
statements filed by defendants 1, 2,4 and 5 have they 
pleaded, that defendant no. 1 had obtained the consent, 
either express or implied, from the plaintiff before 
making the transfers. Further the proviso to section 41 
of the TP Act requires that the transferees to take 
reasonable care in ascertaining that the transferor had 

Civil Appeal No. 8187 of 2023 
 
Page 12 of 14 
 
power to make the transfer and that they had acted in 
good faith. This again would require specific pleading 
and evidence by the transferees. As already recorded 
above, even at the cost of repetition, defendants 2,4 and 
5, the purchasers, from defendant no. 1, neither pleaded 
such facts nor entered the witness box to prove such 
facts as required under the proviso. The relief granted by 
the High Court relying upon section 41 of the TP Act was 
thus completely unwarranted, misplaced and against the 
pleading and evidence on record.  
14. Once the High Court had held that the Will dated 
12.12.1988 was genuine and bona fide and duly proved 
and, further that the Will dated 16.05.1994 was not a 
valid 
document 
being 
shrouded 
with 
suspicious 
circumstances, there was no occasion for the High Court 
to have shown any kind of sympathy with the purchasers 
i.e. defendants 2, 4 and 5. Once the Will itself was held 
to be invalid, no right accrued in favour of defendant no.1, 
and if defendant no.1 did not receive any right, title or 
interest under the Will dated 16.05.1994, there was no 

Civil Appeal No. 8187 of 2023 
 
Page 13 of 14 
 
question of defendants 2, 4 and 5 getting any better right, 
title or interest than defendant no.1 their vendor. We find 
substance in the aforesaid submission as from the 
pleadings, evidence and material on record, we find that 
the submission on behalf of the plaintiffs-appellants is 
fully substantiated. As such, the appeal filed by the 
plaintiffs-appellants deserves to be allowed. 
15. Insofar as the appeal filed by the defendant no.1 is 
concerned, we are more than clear that the findings 
recorded by the first Appellate Court and the High Court 
on the validity of the second Will dated 16.05.1994 being 
shrouded with suspicious circumstances, is well 
reasoned and based on evidence on record. The 
defendant no.1 had completely failed to dispel and clear 
the clouds surrounding the Will dated 16.05.1994. The 
first Appellate Court has dealt with in great detail on the 
said aspect, which finding has been affirmed by the High 
Court. The same being a pure finding of fact, we are not 
inclined to interfere with the same. As such, the appeal 
filed by the defendant no.1, Vikram Singh is liable to be 

Civil Appeal No. 8187 of 2023 
 
Page 14 of 14 
 
dismissed. 
16. In view of the above, the Appeal No.8187 of 2023 is 
allowed. The judgment of the High Court to the extent it 
extends benefit to the defendant nos.2, 4 and 5 is set 
aside and that of the first Appellate Court decreeing the 
suit in totality is affirmed. The Appeal No.8188 of 2023 
is, hereby, dismissed.
