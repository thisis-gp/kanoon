This appeal by special leave is directed against the final 
judgment dated 27th August, 2012 passed by the Division Bench 
of the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Letters Patent Appeal 
No. 1254 of 2011, whereby the said appeal preferred by the 
appellant herein was dismissed and the judgment dated 23rd 
February, 2010 passed by the learned Single Judge of the High

and so also the judgment dated 23rd March, 2011 passed by the 
learned Single Judge in Civil Review No. 82 of 2010 were upheld. 
3. 
Facts in a nutshell are that the appellant herein was 
appointed to the post of Supply Inspector in the Government of 
Bihar in the year 1966.  After serving for 15 years, he received his 
first time bound promotion as Marketing Officer and was put in 
Junior Selection Grade w.e.f. 1st April, 1981.  Upon completing 25 
years in service, the appellant was further promoted to the post of 
Senior Selection Grade, Marketing Officer-cum-Assistant District 
Supply Officer(in short ‘ADSO’) w.e.f. 10th, March 1991 in the pay 
scale of Rs.2000-3800.   
4. 
The Government of Bihar issued a Resolution dated 8th 
February, 1999 revising the pay scale of Marketing Officer from 
Rs.1640-2900 to Rs.5500-9000 and that of ADSO, from Rs.2000-
3800 to Rs.6500-10500 w.e.f. 1st January, 1996.  Since the 
appellant had been promoted as ADSO w.e.f. 10th March, 1991, his 
pay scale was revised to Rs.6500-10500 in accordance with the 
Resolution dated 8th February, 1999 which is quoted below for 
ready reference: - 
"11. The State Government have decided to abolish the 
existing facilities of Time Bound Promotions and Selection 
Grades, discussed in paras 10 and 12 of F.D. Resolution 
No.6021 dated 18th December, 1989 and they shall cease to 

3 
 
be applicable with effect from 1st January, 1996 and 
thereafter in the existing pay scales. If any such 
promotion, however, is due under the Rules before 1st 
January, 1996, it shall be given and the payment of 
arrears in the existing scale shall be made only upto 31st 
December, 1995 after which the promotion would be 
deemed to have been automatically terminated. While 
fixing pay in the revised scales, such promotions given after 31st 
December, 1995 will not be taken into consideration. If such 
promotions have been given after 31st December, 1995 then the 
question of adjustment of such additional emoluments 
obtained in the process, will be decided after the Fitment 
Committee submits its recommendations on promotion Policy. 
Promotion to any vacancy of a post identified as need based 
post would be admissible. The procedure for identification of 
such need based posts has been set out in paragraph 12." 
                                                                 (emphasis supplied) 
5. 
The appellant superannuated from the post of ADSO on 31st 
January, 2001. At the time of retirement, the last pay drawn by 
the appellant was Rs.10500 in the pay scale of Rs.6500-10500 
with admissible emoluments.  As per the Bihar Pension Rules of 
1950, his pension was calculated at 50% of the average 
emoluments and was quantified at Rs.5247 per month.  
Accordingly, the pension as above was disbursed to the appellant 
from the date of his retirement. 
6. 
It seems that the Accountant General, State of Bihar, raised 
an objection dated 28th January, 2003, regarding the promotion 
accorded to the appellant on 10th March, 1991 with a further 
remark that the promotion given to the appellant on 10th March, 
1991 would become ineffective after 1st January, 1996 in view of 

4 
 
the Government Resolution dated 8th February, 1999 and, thus, 
the pay scale of the appellant would have to be revised and reduced 
to match that of the lower post, i.e., the Marketing Officer. 
7. 
After more than eight years from his retirement, the appellant 
received a letter dated 15th April, 2009 from the Government of 
Bihar conveying that an error had been committed in his pay 
fixation and, therefore, a sum of Rs.63,765/- had to be recovered 
from him as the same had been paid in excess beyond his 
entitlement.  The letter directed the appellant to refund the 
aforesaid amount in one go or instalments. Language of the said 
letter is extracted below :-  
“With reference to the above mentioned subject it is 
submitted that after receiving the enquiry report from the 
enquiry officer of the departmental enquiry done against you 
and the analysis of the department, it has been decided that a 
sum of Rs.63,765/- has been paid to you in excess due to 
mistake in fixation of pay which is recoverable from you. 
 
Kindly make it clear whether you will pay the said amount 
in one go or in instalments.  Kindly submit your report in this 
regard within 15 days to ensure further action.”  
   
   
 
 
 
 
         (emphasis supplied) 
 
8. 
Being aggrieved by the recovery notice and the reduction of 
his pension, the appellant made several representations to the 
Government of Bihar protesting against the reduction of his 
pension and the proposed recovery. However, when such 
representations were not responded to by the concerned authority, 

5 
 
the appellant preferred a petition under Article 226 of the 
Constitution of India, being Writ Petition No. 6714 of 2009 before 
the High Court. The High Court, vide order dated 20th July, 2009 
directed the State of Bihar to consider the appellant’s 
representation.  Pursuant thereto, on 4th September 2009, the 
appellant filed another detailed representation to the Government 
of Bihar, pointing out that paragraph 11(supra) of the Government 
Resolution dated 8th February, 1999 had been misinterpreted in 
the letter dated 15th April, 2009, to deny the benefit of the 
admissible pay scale to the appellant as per his entitlement, which 
led to the unjust reduction of his pensionary benefits. A pertinent 
plea was taken in the representation that the paragraph 11(supra) 
could not be interpreted to the prejudice of the appellant as he had 
been given time bound promotion much before 31st December, 
1995 and that the said Resolution specifically protected the 
promotions made prior to the said date. Therefore, the appellant 
was entitled to seek protection of his pay scale fixed in the bracket 
of Rs.6500-10500 on the promotional post of ADSO. 
9. 
The Secretary, Food and Consumer Protection Department, 
Government of Bihar issued a communication dated 8th October, 
2009 rejecting the appellant’s representation observing that the 

6 
 
promotion granted to the appellant would automatically come to 
an end after 31st December, 1995 by virtue of the Government 
Resolution dated 8th February, 1999 and hence, his pay scale 
would have to be revised and reduced to Rs.5500-9000, by treating 
the appellant on the post of Marketing Officer instead of ADSO at 
the time of retirement. 
10. The appellant preferred CWJC No. 18542 of 2009 before the 
High Court of Patna assailing the said order.  The learned Single 
Judge, vide order dated 23rd February, 2010 dismissed the said 
writ petition.  
11. Asserting that his grievances had not been properly 
addressed by the learned Single Judge, the appellant filed a Review 
Petition No. 82 of 2010 before the High Court which was rejected 
vide order dated 23rd March, 2011. 
12. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid orders, the appellant filed 
two Letters Patent Appeals being Letters Patent Appeal No. 1254 
of 2011, challenging the order dated 23rd February, 2010 and 
Letters Patent Appeal No. 815 of 2011 challenging the order dated 
23rd March, 2011. Learned Division Bench, rejected the LPA No. 
815 of 2011 as not maintainable vide order dated 24th August, 
2012, whereas the LPA No. 1254 of 2011 was rejected vide order 

7 
 
dated 27th August, 2012, holding that the revision and consequent 
reduction in pay fixation of the appellant had been done in 
accordance with the paragraph 11(supra) of the Government 
Resolution dated 8th February, 1999 as per which, the appellant 
was not entitled to the higher pay scale which had wrongly been 
accorded to him. The said order is assailed in this appeal by special 
leave. 
Submissions on behalf of the appellant: - 
13. Learned counsel for the appellant urged that the impugned 
orders are ex facie bad in the eyes of law because the Government 
Resolution dated 8th February 1999, was misinterpreted by the 
authorities as well as by the High Court.  He urged that paragraph 
11(supra) of the Government Resolution dated 8th February 1999, 
clearly postulates that the same would not have any adverse effect 
on the employees who had received the time bound promotions 
prior to 31st December 1995.  Admittedly, the appellant had been 
given time bound promotion as Senior Selection Grade, Marketing 
Officer-cum-Assistant District Supply Officer on 10th March, 1991, 
which was long before the cut off date fixed under the said 
Government Resolution, i.e., 31st December, 1995 and thus, he 
was rightfully conferred the benefit of the revised pay scale i.e. 

8 
 
Rs.6500-10500 under the recommendations of the 5th Pay 
Commission.  The Government Resolution dated 8th February, 
1999 having clearly indicated the cut-off date as 31st December, 
1995, the appellant would be protected from the adverse effects 
thereof and was entitled to protect his promotion and pay scale. 
He thus, urged that the impugned orders are grossly illegal and 
cannot be sustained. 
14. He further contended that the reduction in the pay scale of 
the appellant and the direction to effect recovery eight years after 
his retirement, that too, without adhering to the principles of 
natural justice, is even otherwise illegal, arbitrary and violative of 
Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India and thus, the same 
cannot be sustained.  He urged that the learned Single Judge as 
well as the Division Bench of the High Court clearly fell in error 
while interpreting the Government Resolution dated 8th February, 
1999 because paragraph 11(supra) thereof protects the time bound 
promotion offered to the appellant as per his entitlement on 10th 
March, 1991 and so also the revised pay scale applicable to the 
said post under the 5th Pay Commission.   
15. On these grounds, learned counsel for the appellant implored 
the Court to set aside the impugned orders and the proposed 

9 
 
recovery from the appellant and so also the consequential 
reduction in his future pensionary benefits. 
Submissions on behalf of the respondent: - 
16. Per contra, learned counsel representing the State of Bihar, 
vehemently and fervently opposed the submissions advanced by 
the learned counsel for the appellant.  It was contended that the 
Government Resolution dated 8th February, 1999 was made 
uniformly applicable to all employees in the State of Bihar.  The 
appellant has not been singled out for the impugned action and 
thus, there is no question of any discrimination being meted out 
to the appellant.  The Office of the Accountant General had noticed 
the manifest error/irregularity in grant of revised pay scale to the 
appellant and thus, a letter dated 15th April, 2009 was issued 
thereby, requiring the appellant to refund the excess amount 
which he had received on account of wrong pay scale having been 
conferred to him.  He submitted that the learned Single Judge as 
well as the Division Bench of the High Court rightly interpreted the 
Government Resolution dated 8th February, 1999 and recorded 
concurrent findings of fact denying relief to the appellant and thus, 
the appellant is not entitled to seek indulgence from this Court in 

10 
 
this appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.  He 
urged that the appeal should be dismissed. 
Discussions and Conclusion: - 
17. We have given our thoughtful consideration to submissions 
advanced at bar and have gone through the material available on 
record. 
18. At the outset, we may note that the fact regarding the 
appellant having been accorded time bound promotion from the 
post of Marketing Officer in Junior Selection Grade to Senior 
Selection Grade, Marketing Officer-cum-Assistant District Supply 
Officer(ADSO) as per his entitlement on 10th March 1991 is not in 
dispute. It is not the case of the respondents that the said 
promotion suffered from any irregularity or was given against the 
rules and regulations.  The Resolution dated 19th January, 1991 
placed on record as Annexure P-1 indicates that the next 
promotional channel from the post of the Lower Senior 
Grade(Marketing Officer) was to the post of Upper Senior 
Grade(Upper Marketing Officer).  Earlier, the pay scale for the post 
of Lower Senior Grade(Marketing Officer) was fixed at Rs.1800-
3330 whereas for the promotional post i.e. Upper Senior 
Grade(Marketing Officer), the applicable pay scale was fixed at 

11 
 
Rs.2000-3800.  The appellant having been duly promoted to the 
post of Upper Senior Grade(Upper Marketing Officer) w.e.f. 10th 
March, 1991 was entitled to and was rightly given the pay scale of 
the promotional post.  Pursuant to the 5th Pay Commission being 
applied, the Government of Bihar issued a Resolution dated 8th 
February, 1999, whereby the pay scale applicable to the post of 
Upper Senior Grade(Upper Marketing Officer) was revised from 
Rs.2000-3800 to Rs.6500-10500. The paragraph 11(supra) of the 
said Government Resolution specifically protects the promotions 
granted to the employees prior to 31st December, 1995.  Only those 
employees who were not promoted by the cut off date, i.e., 31st 
December, 1995 would get a notional promotion and consequent 
rise in pay scale which would come to an end w.e.f. 31st December, 
1995.  Apparently thus, the appellant could not have been put to 
a disadvantage and his pay scale could not have been reduced 
prospectively by virtue of the said Resolution. Even if paragraph 
11(supra) was not in existence, the appellant could not have been 
subjected to eight years after his retirement because there was no 
illegality in conferment of the revised pay scale to the appellant 
which was an action taken by the State Government as per the 
applicable rules and regulations.   

12 
 
19. The order dated 15th April, 2009 whereby it was 
communicated to the appellant that it had been decided to recover 
a sum of Rs.63,765/- paid in excess due to mistake in fixation of 
pay, also indicates that a departmental inquiry was conducted 
against the appellant which had led to the impugned action.  On a 
pertinent query being made in this regard, the learned counsel 
candidly conceded that no such departmental inquiry was ever 
conducted against the appellant. 
20. Without prejudice to the above findings, we are of the view 
that no departmental action could have been initiated by the State 
against 
the 
appellant 
after 
eight 
years 
following 
his 
superannuation because the employer employee relationship had 
come to an end after the appellant’s superannuation.  The order 
directing reduction in pay scale and recovery from the appellant 
was manifestly not preceded by any show cause notice and was 
thus, passed in gross violation of the principles of natural justice.  
Pursuant to the order dated 20th July, 2009 passed in the Writ 
Petition No. 6714 of 2009 filed by the appellant, he submitted a 
representation to the Secretary, Food and Consumer Protection 
Department, Government of Bihar, which vide order dated 8th 
October, 2009 was rejected, preceded by a personal hearing.  A 

13 
 
perusal of the said order would indicate that the Secretary took a 
view that as per paragraph 11(supra) of the Government 
Resolution, the first/second time bound promotion of the 
appellant had come to an end automatically w.e.f. on 1st January, 
1996 and thus, the appellant was required to be redesignated to 
the post of Marketing Officer and would be entitled to the revised 
pay of Rs.5500-9000 w.e.f. 1st January, 1996 as recommended by 
the Fitment Committee. Thus, even in this order, the promotion 
conferred to the appellant to the post of ADSO on 10th March, 1991 
is not doubted.   
21. We firmly believe that any decision taken by the State 
Government to reduce an employee’s pay scale and recover the 
excess amount cannot be applied retrospectively and that too after 
a long time gap.  In the case of Syed Abdul Qadir and Others v. 
State of Bihar and Others1, this Court held that when the excess 
unauthorised payment is detected within a short period of time, it 
would be open for the employer to recover the same. Conversely, if 
the payment had been made for a long duration of time, it would 
be iniquitous to make any recovery. The relevant paras of the Syed 
Abdul Qadir(supra) are extracted hereinbelow: - 
 
1 (2009) 3 SCC 475 

14 
 
“57. This Court, in a catena of decisions, has granted relief 
against recovery of excess payment of emoluments/allowances 
if (a) the excess amount was not paid on account of any 
misrepresentation or fraud on the part of the employee, and (b) 
if such excess payment was made by the employer by applying 
a wrong principle for calculating the pay/allowance or on the 
basis of a particular interpretation of rule/order, which is 
subsequently found to be erroneous. 
 
58. The relief against recovery is granted by courts not because 
of any right in the employees, but in equity, exercising judicial 
discretion to relieve the employees from the hardship that will 
be caused if recovery is ordered. But, if in a given case, it is 
proved that the employee had knowledge that the payment 
received was in excess of what was due or wrongly paid, or in 
cases where the error is detected or corrected within a short 
time of wrong payment, the matter being in the realm of judicial 
discretion, courts may, on the facts and circumstances of any 
particular case, order for recovery of the amount paid in excess. 
 
59. Undoubtedly, the excess amount that has been paid to the 
appellant teachers was not because of any misrepresentation 
or fraud on their part and the appellants also had no knowledge 
that the amount that was being paid to them was more than 
what they were entitled to. It would not be out of place to 
mention here that the Finance Department had, in its counter-
affidavit, admitted that it was a bona fide mistake on their part. 
The excess payment made was the result of wrong 
interpretation of the Rule that was applicable to them, for which 
the appellants cannot be held responsible. Rather, the whole 
confusion was because of inaction, negligence and carelessness 
of the officials concerned of the Government of Bihar. Learned 
counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant teachers 
submitted that majority of the beneficiaries have either retired 
or are on the verge of it. Keeping in view the peculiar facts and 
circumstances of the case at hand and to avoid any hardship 
to the appellant teachers, we are of the view that no recovery of 
the amount that has been paid in excess to the appellant 
teachers should be made.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
22. Similarly, this Court in ITC Limited v. State of Uttar 
Pradesh and Others2, held as under: - 
 
2 (2011) 7 SCC 493 

15 
 
“108. We may give an example from service jurisprudence, 
where a principle of equity is frequently invoked to give relief to 
an employee in somewhat similar circumstances. Where the 
pay or other emoluments due to an employee is determined and 
paid by the employer, and subsequently the employer finds, 
(usually on audit verification) that on account of wrong 
understanding of the applicable rules by the officers 
implementing the rules, excess payment is made, courts have 
recognised the need to give limited relief in regard to recovery 
of past excess payments, to reduce hardship to the innocent 
employees, who benefited from such wrong interpretation.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (emphasis supplied) 
 
23. In the case of State of Punjab and Others v. Rafiq 
Masih (White Washer) and Others3, this Court held as 
under: -  
“18. It is not possible to postulate all situations of hardship 
which would govern employees on the issue of recovery, where 
payments have mistakenly been made by the employer, in 
excess of their entitlement. Be that as it may, based on the 
decisions referred to hereinabove, we may, as a ready reference, 
summarise the following few situations, wherein recoveries by 
the employers, would be impermissible in law: 
 
(i) 
Recovery from the employees belonging to 
Class III and Class IV service (or Group C and Group 
D service). 
 
(ii) 
Recovery from the retired employees, or the 
employees who are due to retire within one year, of 
the order of recovery. 
 
(iii) 
Recovery from the employees, when the excess 
payment has been made for a period in excess of five 
years, before the order of recovery is issued. 
 
(iv) 
Recovery in cases where an employee has 
wrongfully been required to discharge duties of a 
higher post, and has been paid accordingly, even 
though he should have rightfully been required to 
work against an inferior post. 
 
 
3 (2015) 4 SCC 334 

16 
 
 
(v) In any other case, where the court arrives at the 
conclusion, that recovery if made from the employee, 
would be iniquitous or harsh or arbitrary to such an 
extent, as would far outweigh the equitable balance of 
the employer's right to recover.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   (emphasis supplied) 
24. Recently, this Court in Thomas Daniel v. State of Kerala 
and Others4,  held that the State cannot recover excess amount 
paid to the ex-employee after the delay of 10 years.  
25. The Government Resolution dated 8th February, 1999 to be 
specific, the highlighted portion supra is amenable to the 
interpretation that it protects the status and pay of those 
employees who had received their time bound promotions prior to 
31st December, 1995.  As a consequence, the Secretary concerned, 
while rejecting the representation clearly misinterpreted and 
misapplied the said Resolution to the detriment of the appellant. 
26. The learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the 
High Court of Patna also seem to have fallen in the same error.  In 
addition thereto, we are of the view that any step of reduction in 
the pay scale and recovery from a Government employee would 
tantamount to a punitive action because the same has drastic civil 
as well as evil consequences.  Thus, no such action could have 
been taken against the appellant, more particularly, because he 
 
4 2022 SCC OnLine SC 536 

17 
 
had been promoted as an ADSO, while drawing the pay scale of 
Rs.6500-10500 applicable to the post, way back on 10th March, 
1991 and had also superannuated eight years ago before the 
recovery notice dated 15th April, 2009 was issued. The impugned 
action directing reduction of pay scale and recovery of the excess 
amount is grossly arbitrary and illegal and also suffers from the 
vice of non-adherence to the principles of natural justice and 
hence, the same cannot be sustained. 
27. The order dated 8th October, 2009 passed by the State 
Government directing reduction in the pay scale of the appellant 
from Rs.6500-10500 to Rs.5500-9000 w.e.f. 1st January, 1996 and 
directing recovery of the excess amount from him is grossly illegal 
and arbitrary and is hereby quashed and set aside.  The impugned 
order dated 27th August, 2012 passed by the Division Bench of the 
High Court does not stand to scrutiny and is hereby quashed. 
Therefore, the appellant shall continue to receive the pension in 
accordance with the pay scale of Rs.6500-10500. 
28. In case, if any reduction in pension and consequential 
recovery was effected on account of the impugned orders, the 
appellant shall be entitled to the restoration/reimbursement 
thereof with interest as applicable. 

18 
 
29. The appeal is allowed in these terms.  No order as to costs. 
30. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
