PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J. 
1. 
The issue for consideration before us is whether the timeline 
for refund under Section 38(3) of the Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 
20041 must be mandatorily followed while recovering dues under 
the Act by adjusting them against the refund amount.  
2. 
The brief facts relevant for our purpose are as follows. The 
respondent is a joint venture engaged in the execution of works 
contracts for the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and makes 
purchases for this purpose. It claimed refund of excess tax credit

amounting to Rs. 17,10,15,285/- for the 4th quarter of 2015-16 
through revised return filed on 31.03.2017 and Rs. 5,44,39,148/- 
for the 1st quarter of 2017-18 through return filed on 29.03.2019, 
along with applicable interest under Section 42 of the Act. The 
appellant did not pay the refund even until 2022, pursuant to 
which the respondent sent a letter dated 09.11.2022 for the 
consideration of their refund. The Value Added Tax Officer passed 
an adjustment order dated 18.11.2022 to adjust the respondent’s 
claims for refund against dues under default notices dated 
30.03.2020, 23.03.2021, 30.03.2021, and 26.03.2022. The 
respondent then filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court 
for quashing the adjustment order and the default notices.  
3. 
By judgment dated 21.09.2023, impugned herein, the High 
Court quashed the adjustment order and directed refund of  
Rs. 17,10,15,285/- for the 4th quarter of 2015-16 and  
Rs. 5,44,39,148/- for the 1st quarter of 2017-18, along with 
interest as per Section 42 till the date of realisation.2 In respect of 
the default notices, the High Court gave liberty to the respondent 
to avail statutory appeal under Section 74 of the Act. 
 
2 WP (C) 2491/2023, judgment dated 21.09.2023 (‘Impugned judgment’).

4. 
The present appeal is restricted to the issue of quashing the 
adjustment order. The High Court placed reliance on the Delhi 
High Court’s judgment in Flipkart India Private Limited v. Value 
Added Tax Officer, Ward 3003 to summarise the law on refund 
under Section 38. It held that the department must scrupulously 
adhere to the time limit for processing and issuing the refunds 
under Section 38. Whenever the department seeks to obtain 
necessary information under Section 59 of the Act, it must take 
steps within the time limit envisaged under the Act. Further, the 
refund amount can be adjusted only when an enforceable demand 
in the nature of tax or duty is pending against the assessee. The 
department does not have any legal right or justification to retain 
the amount beyond the time limit prescribed under Section 38.4 In 
the facts of the present case, it was held that the mandate of the 
Act has not been followed and hence the adjustment order is not 
maintainable.5  
5. 
We have heard the learned ASG for the department and  
Mr. Rajesh Jain, learned counsel for the respondent-assessee. The 
learned ASG has submitted that the timelines specified in Section 
 
3 2023 SCC OnLine Del 5201. 
4 Impugned judgment, para 10. 
5 ibid, para 11.

38(3) are only to ensure that interest is paid if the refund is delayed 
beyond the statutorily prescribed period. However, he has argued, 
the timeline cannot be used to denude the power to adjust refund 
amounts against outstanding dues under Section 38(2). The 
refund can be adjusted as long as outstanding dues exist at the 
time when the refund is processed, even if it is beyond the 
stipulated timeline. The learned counsel for the assessee has 
supported the reasoning of the High Court and has placed reliance 
on several judgments of the Delhi High Court that affirm this 
position of law.6 
6. 
We find no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment, 
which follows the view that has been consistently adopted by the 
High Court.7  The finding of the High Court is based on the plain 
language of Section 38 of the Act, which reads as follows: 
“38. Refunds 
(1) Subject to the other provisions of this section and the rules, the 
Commissioner shall refund to a person the amount of tax, penalty and 
interest, if any, paid by such person in excess of the amount due from 
him.

(2) Before making any refund, the Commissioner shall first apply such 
excess towards the recovery of any other amount due under this Act, 
or under the CST Act, 1956 (74 of 1956).  
(3) Subject to sub-section (4) and sub-section (5) of this section, any 
amount remaining after the application referred to in sub-section (2) 
of this section shall be at the election of the dealer, either –  
(a) refunded to the person, –  
(i) within one month after the date on which the return was furnished 
or claim for the refund was made, if the tax period for the person 
claiming refund is one month; 
(ii) within two months after the date on which the return was 
furnished or claim for the refund was made, if the tax period for the 
person claiming refund is a quarter; or  
(b) carried forward to the next tax period as a tax credit in that period. 
(4) Where the Commissioner has issued a notice to the person under 
section 58 of this Act advising him that an audit, investigation or 
inquiry into his business affairs will be undertaken or sought 
additional information under section 59 of this Act, the amount shall 
be carried forward to the next tax period as a tax credit in that period. 
(5) The Commissioner may, as a condition of the payment of a refund, 
demand security from the person pursuant to the powers conferred in 
section 25 of this Act within fifteen days from the date on which the 
return was furnished or claim for the refund was made. 
(6) The Commissioner shall grant refund within fifteen days from the 
date the dealer furnishes the security to his satisfaction under sub-
section (5). 
(7) For calculating the period prescribed in clause (a) of sub- section 
(3), the time taken to –  
(a) furnish the security under sub-section (5) to the satisfaction of the 
Commissioner; or  
(b) furnish the additional information sought under section 59; or 
(c) furnish returns under section 26 and section 27; or  
(d) furnish the declaration or certificate forms as required under 
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, 
shall be excluded  
(8) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, where –  
(a) a registered dealer has sold goods to an unregistered person; and  
(b) the price charged for the goods includes an amount of tax payable 
under this Act; 

6 
 
(c) the dealer is seeking the refund of this amount or to apply this 
amount under clause (b) of sub-section (3) of this section;  
no amount shall be refunded to the dealer or may be applied 
by the dealer under clause (b) of sub-section (3) of this section unless 
the Commissioner is satisfied that the dealer has refunded the 
amount to the purchaser. 
(9) Where –  
(a) a registered dealer has sold goods to another registered dealer; 
and 
(b) the price charged for the goods expressly includes an amount of 
tax payable under this Act,  
the amount may be refunded to the seller or may be applied by 
the seller under clause (b) of sub-section (3) of this section and the 
Commissioner may reassess the buyer to deny the amount of the 
corresponding tax credit claimed by such buyer, whether or not the 
seller refunds the amount to the buyer. 
(10) Where a registered dealer sells goods and the price charged for 
the goods is expressed not to include an amount of tax payable under 
this Act the amount may be refunded to the seller or may be applied 
by the seller under clause (b) of sub-section (3) of this section without 
the seller being required to refund an amount to the purchaser. 
(11) Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in sub-
section (3) of this section, no refund shall be allowed to a dealer who 
has not filed any return due under this Act.” 
 
7. 
Sub-section (1) provides that any amount of tax, penalty and 
interest that is in excess of the amount due from a person shall be 
refunded to him by the Commissioner. Sub-section (2) permits the 
Commissioner to first apply such excess to recover any other 
amount that is due under the Act or the Central Sales Tax Act, 
1956. Sub-section (3), which is relevant for our purpose, provides 
the assessee with the option of getting the refund or carrying it 
forward to the next tax period as a tax credit. In case of refund, 

7 
 
Section 38(3)(a) provides the timeline for refund from the date on 
which the return is furnished or claim for refund is made as: (i) 
within one month, if the period for refund is one month; (ii) within 
two months, if the period for refund is a quarter. Sub-section (4) 
provides that if notice has been issued under Section 58 or 
additional information has been sought under Section 59, then the 
amount shall be carried forward to the next tax period as tax 
credit. Sub-sections (5) and (6) pertain to security. Sub-section (7) 
provides certain exclusions while calculating the period under 
sub-section (3). Sub-sections (8)-(10) pertain to refund in cases of 
sale to registered and unregistered dealers. Lastly, sub-section (11) 
provides that the refund shall not be allowed to a dealer who has 
not filed any return that is due under the Act.  
8. 
The language of Section 38(3) is mandatory and the 
department must adhere to the timeline stipulated therein to fulfil 
the object of the provision, which is to ensure that refunds are 
processed and issued in a timely manner.  
9. 
In the present case, Section 38(3)(a)(ii) is relevant as both the 
refunds in the present case pertain to quarter tax periods. 
Therefore, as per Section 38(3)(a)(ii), the refund should have been 
processed within two months from when the returns were filed 

8 
 
(31.03.2017 and 29.03.2019), which comes up to 31.05.2017 and 
29.05.2019. 
The 
default 
notices 
are 
dated 
30.03.2020, 
23.03.2021, 30.03.2021, and 26.03.2022. It is therefore evident 
that the default notices were issued after the period within which 
the refund should have been processed. Sub-section (2) only 
permits adjusting amounts towards recovery that are “due under 
the Act”. By the time when the refund should have been processed 
as per the provisions of the Act, the dues under the default notices 
had not crystallised and the respondent was not liable to pay the 
same at the time. The appellant-department is therefore not 
justified in retaining the refund amount beyond the stipulated 
period and then adjusting the refund amount against the amounts 
due under default notices that were issued subsequent to the 
refund period.  
10. Further, the learned ASG’s contention that the purpose of the 
timeline provided under sub-section (3) is only for calculation of 
interest under Section 428 would defeat the object of the provision. 
 
8 The relevant portion of Section 42 reads: 
“42. Interest 
(1) A person entitled to a refund under this Act, shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the refund, 
simple interest at the annual rate notified by the Government from time to time, computed on a daily 
basis from the later of – 
   (a) the date that the refund was due to be paid to the person; or  
   (b) the date that the overpaid amount was paid by the person, until the date on which the refund 
is given. 

9 
 
Such an interpretation would effectively enable the department to 
retain refundable amounts for long durations for the purpose of 
adjusting them on a future date. This would go against the object 
and purpose of the provision. This contention is hence rejected.  
11. In view of the above, we dismiss the present appeal and affirm 
the impugned judgment directing the refund of amounts along 
with interest as provided under Section 42 of the Act.  
12. Pending applications, if any, are disposed of.

    PROVIDED that the interest shall be calculated on the amount of refund due after deducting 
therefrom any tax, interest, penalty or any other dues under this Act, or under the Central Sales Tax 
Act, 1956 (74 of 1956):  
     PROVIDED FURTHER that if the amount of such refund is enhanced or reduced, as the case 
may be, such interest shall be enhanced or reduced accordingly.  
 Explanation.- If the delay in granting the refund is attributable to the said person, whether wholly or 
in part, the period of the delay attributable to him shall be excluded from the period for which the 
interest is payable.”
