This Civil Appeal is directed against the order dated 06.04.2023 
passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad 
(hereinafter, ‘High Court’), whereby an intra-court appeal preferred by 
the State of Uttar Pradesh (hereinafter, ‘State’) challenging the Single 
Judge’s judgement dated 02.02.2018 was dismissed on the ground of 
delay. Consequently, the judgment of the Single Judge, which effectively 
directed to grant the pay scale of 7500-12000 to Sub-Deputy Inspectors 
of 
Schools/ 
Assistant 
Basic 
Shiksha 
Adhikaris 
(hereinafter, 
‘SDI/ABSA’) and the Deputy Basic Shiksha Adhikaris (hereinafter,

3. 
Since the instant appeal arises out of a long-drawn saga, where 
multiple rounds of litigation occurred inter-se the parties before various 
fora, including this Court, it would be appropriate to narrate the factual 
events before delving into the legal issues raised before us concerning 
the law of precedents, the doctrine of merger and the principle of res 
judicata.  
FACTS 
 
4. 
The controversy centers around the alleged discrepancy in the pay 
scales of SDI/ABSA and DBSA of the Basic Education Department, 
State of Uttar Pradesh vis-à-vis the Headmasters of Junior High Schools 
(hereinafter, ‘Headmaster’). The genesis of this disparity can be traced 
back to the Government Order dated 20.07.2001 (hereinafter, ‘2001 
Order’), issued on the basis of the recommendations of the Fifth Central 
Pay Commission, pursuant to which the pay scales of State Government 
teachers, including Headmasters, were brought on par with Central 
Government teachers, with effect from 01.07.2001.  
5. 
  The effect of the 2001 Order, in essence, was that the basic pay 
scale of Headmasters stood revised from 4625-125-7000 to 6500-200-
10500, with a further revision of their Selection Grade from 4800-150-
7650 to 7500-250-12000.  There was, however, no alteration in the pay 
scales of SDI/ABSA and DBSA and resultantly, their pay scales became 
lesser than those granted to the Headmasters.   

Page 3 of 33 
 
6. 
In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of this issue, it is 
essential to take into account the revision in pay scales across various 
posts over time. 
7. 
The pay scale granted for the post of Sub-Deputy Inspector of 
Schools (SDI) since the year 1945, with consequent revisions, is 
depicted in a tabular format hereinbelow:

The position of the ABSA, being equivalent to that of SDI, likewise bore 
the same pay scale of 4500-7000, with effect from 01.01.1996.

The pay scale assigned for the post of DBSA since 1945, with 
subsequent revisions, is outlined in the table below:

Lastly, the pay scale apportioned for the post of Headmaster since 
1945, with subsequent revisions, is detailed in the table below:

10. 
It may be seen from the above table that the post of Headmaster 
was placed in the pay scale of 4625-7000 w.e.f. 01.01.1996. Thereafter, 
the said pay scale was revised to 6500-10500 w.e.f. 01.07.2001, and in 
addition, the Selection Grade of Rs. 7500-250-12000 was also granted 
through the 2001 Order. Additionally, Headmasters also got a 
promotion grade pay scale of 8000-13500 vide a subsequent 
government order dated 03.09.2001.  No corresponding revision in the 
pay scales of SDI/ABSA and DBSA was, however, made w.e.f. 
01.07.2001.

11. 
The perceived anomaly in pay scales being the hallmark of 
disputation, it may be useful to reflect the differentiation in pay scales, 
which have been granted to SDI/ABSA, DBSA and Headmasters since 
1945, along with subsequent revisions, by way of the following 
comparative tabulation:

12. 
The recruitment to the posts of SDI/ABSA is governed by the Uttar 
Pradesh Subordinate Educational (Sub Deputy Inspector of Schools) 
Service Rules, 1992 (hereinafter, ‘Rules’). As per the Rules, 80% of the 
posts of SDI/ABSA are mandated to be filled by direct recruitment 
through the Public Service Commission, 10% of the posts are to be filled 
up through selection from amongst the Headmasters of Junior High 
Schools and the remaining 10% of the posts are filled through the 
promotion of Extension Teachers and Craft Teachers working in the CT 

Page 6 of 33 
 
Grade, who were appointed before 21.04.1996 under the Redeployment 
Scheme. On the other hand, mode of appointment to the post of 
Headmasters is by way of promotion from among the Assistant Teachers 
of Junior High Schools. Furthermore, it seems that at one point of time, 
the SDI/ABSA and DBSA used to exercise supervisory and 
administrative control over Headmasters and Teachers of Junior High 
Schools. 
13. 
That being said, in order to fully comprehend the origin of this 
strife and the parallel, as well as the subsequent legal proceedings 
leading to the current appeal, it would be beneficial to examine the 
entire set of events hereafter from the vantage point of two rounds of 
litigation. 
THE FIRST ROUND OF LITIGATION  
 
14. 
The Uttar Pradesh Vidhyalay Nirikshak Sangh (hereinafter, 
‘Caveator’), along with the Respondents, filed WP No. 675/2002 before 
the High Court, alleging discrepancies and seeking the grant of pay 
scale of 7500-12000 to SDI/ABSA and corresponding higher pay scale 
to DBSA, on identical terms as per the 2001 Order. A Division Bench of 
the High Court, through its judgment dated 06.05.2002, allowed the 
writ petition after observing that the SDI/ABSA and DBSA were 
supervising the work of Headmasters and were previously receiving 
higher pay scales before further the revision w.e.f. 01.07.2001. The High 

Page 7 of 33 
 
Court viewed that when the pay scale of Headmasters was revised on 
20.07.2001, the pay scales of SDI/ABSA and DBSA also ought to have 
been simultaneously revised. Consequently, the High Court directed the 
State to grant the pay scale of 7500-12000 with effect from 01.07.2001 
to SDI/ABSA and corresponding higher pay scale (8000-13500) with 
effect from 01.07.2001 to the DBSA. The High Court further directed 
the State to consider granting the writ-petitioners therein pay scales 
higher than that of Headmasters on the premise that they had been 
enjoying a better pay scale prior to 20.07.2001.  
15. 
The aggrieved State challenged the High Court’s order through 
Civil Appeal No. 8869/2003 (arising out of SLP(C) No. 900/2003) before 
this Court. During the pendency of that Appeal, the State held 
discussions with the Caveator and referred the matter to the Chief 
Secretary’s Committee (hereinafter, ‘Rizvi Committee’). The Rizvi 
Committee made a proposal dated 12.01.2010 (hereinafter, ‘Proposed 
Policy’), to grant the pay scale of 7500-12000 for the post of Assistant 
Basic Education Block Officer, which was essentially created by 
merging the posts of SDI/ABSA and DBSA, thereby creating a singular 
cadre of 1031 posts. As per the Proposed Policy, the pay scale of 7500-
12000 to the newly designated post of Block Education Officer would be 
notionally effective from 01.01.2006, with actual monetary benefits 
being given with effect from 01.12.2008. The restructuring, as 

Page 8 of 33 
 
proposed, would make available one Officer at the Tahsil / Block level 
to assist Basic Education Officers and District Inspector of Schools in 
carrying out their administrative and supervisory duties. Further, the 
Proposed Policy was made subject to the filing of an application and 
affidavit based on mutual consent of the parties. The High Court’s order 
dated 06.05.2002 was to be accordingly modified to the above extent 
pursuant to a joint application of the parties in the pending appeal. 
16. 
This Court, after noticing the cause of pay anomaly that occurred 
in the year 2001, referred to and relied upon the proposed Policy dated 
12.01.2010 and eventually found no reason to interfere with the High 
Court’s judgement dated 06.05.2002 and dismissed the appeals vide 
the order dated 08.12.2010, on the ground that the State itself had 
taken an appropriate decision to rectify the pay discrepancies and 
hence, no further cause as such survived requiring any further 
adjudication. This Court also noted the fact that no joint application 
based on mutual consent of the parties had been filed. This Court, in 
no uncertain terms, further directed that…. “the Government having 
taken appropriate decision cannot go back from implementing the 
same”. The operative part of the order dated 08.12.2010 reads as 
follows:- 
“We do not find any error to have been committed by the High Court 
in issuing the impugned directions. However, there is no need to 
further dilate on this issue since the Government itself appears 
to have realised the anomaly in fixation of the pay scales as 

Page 9 of 33 
 
is evident from the proceedings dated 12th May, 2010 
emanating from Secretary, Finance Department, Govt. of 
Uttar Pradesh and addressed to the Secretary, Basic 
Education 
Department, 
Govt. 
of 
Uttar 
Pradesh. 
The 
proceedings disclose that an appropriate decision has been 
taken to rectify the pay discrepancies in respect of the post 
of Deputy Inspector of Schools/Deputy Basic Education 
Officer 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Education 
on 
the 
recommendations of the Pay Committee (2008). The operative 
portion of the said proceedings reads as under:-  
 
"According to the above as a result of cadre constitution getting 
sanctioned imaginary the pay scale of Rs. 7500-12000/- from 
01.01.2006 for the post of Block Education Officer, the real 
benefit be given from 01.12.2008." 
 
By the same proceedings, a decision was taken to file the same into 
this Court together with application supported by an affidavit in as 
much as such decision was taken with mutual consent of the parties. 
But for whatever reason, the same has not been filed into the Court.  
 
Since the Government itself has taken appropriate decision 
in the matter as is evident from the proceedings referred to 
hereinabove, no further cause as such survives requiring any 
further adjudication of this appeal and the Government 
having taken appropriate decision cannot go back from 
implementing the same.  
 
In the circumstances, the Civil Appeals are accordingly dismissed.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
17. 
Subsequently, an application seeking clarification of the above 
order was also filed before this Court, which was dismissed as 
withdrawn for being not maintainable vide order dated 08.07.2011. We 
may, however, clarify that the details of such an application are neither 
part of the record of this appeal nor a copy of it was tendered by learned 
counsel for the parties. 

Page 10 of 33 
 
18. 
Nevertheless, and in compliance to this Court’s order dated 
08.12.2010, the Appellant-State issued Government Order dated 
14.07.2011 (modified on 15.07.2011) (hereinafter, ‘2011 Order’), 
whereby 1031 posts of ‘Block Education Officer’ were created by 
merging 1360 posts of SDI/ABSA and 157 posts of DBSA, with the 
sanctioned pay scale of 7500-12000, to be given with effect from 
01.01.2006 notionally, with actual benefits accruing from 01.12.2008.  
THE SECOND ROUND OF LITIGATION 
 
19. 
It is pertinent at this stage to provide some insight into the 
background in which the Respondents instituted parallel proceedings 
before the High Court during the pendency of the First Round of 
Litigation. In order to avoid repetition and for the purposes of the 
present proceedings, we propose to refer the factual matrix pertaining 
to Respondent No. 1 only since Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 are similarly 
placed. 
20. 
 Respondent No. 1 was initially appointed to the post of Assistant 
Teacher in a Primary School on 16.11.1971. He was subsequently 
promoted to Assistant Teacher, Junior High School on 12.01.1977 and 
thereafter as Headmaster, Junior High School on 05.07.1982. 
Subsequently, Respondent No. 1 was appointed as the Sub-Deputy 
Inspector of Schools within the aforementioned 10% promotion quota 
through selection from the post of Headmaster in accordance with the 

Page 11 of 33 
 
1992 Rules, vide the order dated 19.03.1997. Consequently, he was 
placed in the pay scale of 4800-7650 and was receiving a monthly salary 
of Rs. 6000/-. However, with the revision of the pay scale of 
Headmasters to 7500-12000 with effect from 01.07.2001, Respondent 
No. 1 was inadvertently placed in the revised higher pay scale instead 
of what he was entitled to for the post of SDI/ABSA. Respondent No.1 
eventually retired as a Sub-Deputy Inspector on 31.07.2004 upon 
reaching the age of superannuation.  
21. 
Though Respondent No. 1, after his retirement, was paid his 
provident fund dues, his pension and gratuity amounts were withheld 
on the premise that while working as a Sub-Deputy Inspector, he was 
erroneously paid salary in a higher pay scale sanctioned for the post of 
Headmaster of Junior High School. This was followed by recovery orders 
dated 07.12.2005 and 26.06.2007, directing to adjust the excess 
amount paid to Respondent No. 1 from his retiral dues. He was further 
directed to deposit the excess amount within one week, failing which 
the same would be adjusted from his retiral dues. Respondent No. 1 
preferred Writ-A No. 35611/2007 (hereinafter, ‘2007 Writ’) before the 
High Court, seeking quashing of the abovementioned recovery orders 
and further sought a direction to the State to pay the entire pension 
along with arrears calculated at the last pay drawn by him along with 
24% interest on the delayed payment, and also to release the remaining 

Page 12 of 33 
 
10% of the gratuity amount along with interest from the date it became 
due. 
22. 
The High Court, vide an interim order dated 03.08.2007, directed 
the State to pay forthwith the retiral dues admissible to Respondent No. 
1, excepting the amount which was paid in excess to him. It is the 
specific case of the State that this order was duly complied with.  
23. 
The High Court kept the above stated 2007 writ petition pending 
so as to await the outcome of the first round of litigation. Meanwhile, 
when the State issued the 2011 Order, the Respondents once again 
approached the High Court vide Writ A No. 44344/2011 (hereinafter, 
‘2011 Writ’), challenging the 2011 Order while also seeking directions 
for the grant of pay scale of 7500-12000 with effect from 01.01.1996 
and consequential payment of arrears. The High Court then clubbed 
together the Writ Petitions of 2007 and 2011.  
24. 
A Learned Single Judge of the High Court vide judgement dated 
02.02.2018 allowed both the writ petitions, quashed the 2011 Order 
and directed the State to pass appropriate orders within a period of 
three months (hereinafter, ‘Single Judge Judgement’). The Learned 
Single Judge was of the view that the State had wrongfully made 
misrepresentations to this Court with an intent to nullify the benefits 
otherwise accrued in favour of the Respondents.  

Page 13 of 33 
 
25. 
The State Government, who until then was so vigorously pursuing 
the lis, for reasons which are still unbeknownst to us, went into a state 
of slumber. Neither did the State challenge the Single Judge’s dictum 
through an intra-court appeal within a reasonable time, nor did it take 
any conscious decision to honour and implement the said Judgement. 
26. 
The State authorities, therefore, invited the initiation of contempt 
proceedings, which the Respondents filed alleging willful disobedience 
of the Single Judge Judgement, referred to above. Thereafter, on 
23.05.2019, the State authorities woke up and filed an inordinately 
delayed Special Appeal Defective No. 532/2019 before the Division 
Bench of the High Court, challenging the Single Judge Judgement.  
27. 
The High Court, first in its order dated 10.01.2023 in Contempt 
proceedings directed the compliance of the Single Judge’s Judgement 
within 15 days.  The Principal Secretary, Department of Basic 
Education was further show caused to file an affidavit disclosing as to 
how many contempt proceedings had been initiated against him for 
non-compliance of the orders passed by the High Court and their 
outcome, the number of pending contempt proceedings and as to why 
cost of pending litigation be not recovered from him. After such requisite 
affidavit having been filed, the High Court passed an order on 
07.02.2023 initiating proceedings for criminal contempt against the 
Principal Secretary, Department of Basic Education and further 

Page 14 of 33 
 
directed the personal presence of the Chief Secretary and the Additional 
Chief Secretary (Finance), on the next date of hearing – 14.02.2023.  
28. 
The State then approached this Court against the High Court’s 
orders dated 10.01.2023 and 07.02.2023. This Court, vide the order 
dated 13.02.2023, stayed the effect of the abovementioned orders, 
keeping in abeyance the contempt proceedings until further orders. It 
was, however, clarified that the pendency of Special Leave Petitions 
would not pose an impediment to the Division Bench of the High Court 
in deciding the State’s intra-court appeal expeditiously.  
29. 
In the midst of all of these proceedings and in light of this Court’s 
order dated 13.02.2023, the High Court passed the Impugned Order 
dated 06.04.2023 dismissing the application for condonation of delay of 
428 days filed by the Appellant-State.  Consequently, the State’s intra-
court appeal stood rejected, giving rise to the instant proceedings.  
30. 
The sole issue that arises for our consideration, thus, is whether 
the SDI/ABSA and DBSA are entitled to the higher pay scale of 7500-
12000 with effect from 01.07.2001 or whether it has been appropriately 
granted to them from 01.12.2008 onwards? 
CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES 
 
31. 
Learned Additional Solicitor General of India and Learned 
Additional Advocate General, while arguing for the State of Uttar 

Page 15 of 33 
 
Pradesh, urged that the consequence of the directions issued by the 
Learned Single Judge is that the earlier Division Bench judgement of 
the HC dated 06.05.2002 stands restored even though the said 
judgement was no longer in existence as it stood merged in the self-
speaking order dated 08.12.2010 passed by this Court in Civil Appeal 
No. 8869/2003, which was directed against the said judgement of the 
High Court. They pointed out that the financial implications of the 
directions issued by the Single Judge of the High Court are enormous, 
as an additional burden of approximately Rupees 1500 Crores shall be 
fastened on the state exchequer.  
32. 
They fervently submitted that regardless of the negligence of some 
officers who failed to file the intra-court appeal promptly and did not 
render any satisfactory explanation for the inordinate delay, the 
Division Bench of the HC ought to have appreciated the impersonal 
character of the State and condoned the delay so that the intra court 
appeal could be heard on merits. It was emphasized that in deference 
to the order dated 08.12.2010 of this Court, which explicitly approved 
the proposed settlement between the parties, the State Government 
issued the 2011 Order whereby substantial relief with actual arrears of 
pay with effect from 01.12.2008 had been already granted to the 
Respondents and other similarly placed employees of their cadre. The 

Page 16 of 33 
 
2011 Order, it was urged on behalf of the Appellant State, was in 
conformity with the final order passed by this Court.  
33. 
The Learned ASG relied upon the often quoted three-judge bench 
decision of this Court in Kunhayammed v. State of Kerala1 to 
reiterate that once this Court had granted leave against the High Court 
judgement dated 06.05.2002, the doctrine of merger would apply and it 
stood merged with the reasoned order dated 08.12.2010, which was 
eventually passed by this Court. The Appellant-State was thus obligated 
to give effect to the order passed by this Court. According to Learned 
ASG, this Court vide the order dated 08.12.2010 dismissed the appeals 
after noticing the subsequent events that unfolded and held that ‘no 
further cause as such survives requiring any further adjudication of this 
appeal’. Further, this Court also pointed out that no application based 
on mutual consent of the parties was moved. In other words, the 
Learned ASG urged, that this Court rendered the matter infructuous, 
leaving nothing to be adjudicated even though no formal application 
based on mutual consent was moved. It was then contended that the 
2011 Order was issued in a bona fide manner to give effect to the 
directions mandating that the State would not go back from 
implementing the proposal approved by this Court.  
                                                 
1 (2000) 6 SCC 359. 

Page 17 of 33 
 
34. 
Per contra, Mr. Dushyant Dave, Learned Senior Counsel 
representing the Respondents and learned counsel for the Caveator, Ms. 
Shubhangi Tuli, vehemently opposed the claim put forth on behalf of 
the State. They argued that the Respondents, who are retired senior 
citizens, have been dragged by the State in avoidable litigation for the 
last twenty-two years, despite this being a simpliciter case of 
acknowledgement and removal of the pay anomaly. They contended that 
the Appellants have consistently defied the Court’s orders and, being in 
contempt, are making flimsy and false excuses to overreach the judicial 
system. They urged that firstly, the State’s plea regarding the financial 
burden of approximately Rupees 1500 Crores is unsubstantiated and 
has no factual foundation. Secondly, the mere consequence of financial 
burden is not a valid ground to denounce a judicial dictum.   
ANALYSIS 
 
35. 
We have considered the rival submissions in the backdrop of the 
protracted litigation between the parties, which has led to the passing 
of multiple orders by this Court and the High Court, a brief reference to 
which has already been made.  The relevant records have also been 
perused.  
36. 
It may be seen that the instant round of litigation is triggered by 
the Single Judge’s Judgement against which the highly belated intra-
court appeal has been summarily dismissed by the Division Bench of 

Page 18 of 33 
 
the High Court. We are thus required to scrutinize the Single Judge’s 
Judgement to determine whether the consequential directions issued 
therein are justified and in tune with the previous rounds of litigation.  
37. 
We are constrained to observe at the outset that the judgment of 
the Learned Single Judge appears to be wholly misconceived, on several 
parameters, in light of the bizarre observations made with reference to 
the decision of this Court dated 08.12.2010. Learned Single Judge 
seems to have been swayed by a hypothetical reason that the intricacies 
of the Hindi language employed in the proposed Policy were beyond the 
comprehension of the Hon’ble Judges of the Supreme Court, who were 
misled to believe as if it was more than just a mere proposal. The 
Learned Single Judge observed that the State capitalized on this 
misrepresentation before this Court and, consequently, issued the 2011 
Order. It has been further observed that on the basis of such distortion 
and in blatant contravention of the High Court’s previous judgment 
dated 06.05.2022, the State finagled to release a higher pay scale to 
SDI/ABSA, aligning it with that of Headmasters, on a notional basis 
from 01.01.2006 thereby restricting the actual monetary benefits from 
01.12.2008 only. 
38. 
In our considered opinion there is nothing in the order dated 
08.12.2010 of this Court on the basis of which the Learned Single Judge 
of the High Court could draw such sweeping inferences. All that this 

Page 19 of 33 
 
Court unequivocally said was that in light of the Proposed Policy 
decision taken by the State Government to rectify the pay discrepancies 
and to grant certain reliefs to the Respondents or their cadre mates, no 
issue survived for adjudication. To elucidate more simply, this Court 
was satisfied that the Proposed Policy was fair enough to close the 
pending lis. As a follow up, the State was obligated to formalize and give 
effect to the said proposal, which the Appellants eventually did through 
the 2011 Order.  
39. 
However, the Learned Single Judge, while relying on this Court’s 
decision in Supreme Court Employees’ Welfare Association v. Union 
of India and another,2 made two pertinent observations, which we 
propose to analyse in the present context, i.e. — (i) since the Supreme 
Court in its order dated 08.12.2010 dismissed Civil Appeal No. 
8869/2003 and did not discern any error of fact or law in the decision 
of the High Court dated 06.05.2022, the latter would consequently 
operate as res judicata inter se the parties; and (ii) it is impermissible 
for the State Government to overreach and render nugatory a judgement 
of the High Court, once it has attained finality.  
40. 
In this regard, it seems to us that the High Court has construed 
narrowly the ratio of the decision of this Court in Supreme Court 
Employees’ (supra) which encapsulated that when a Special Leave 
                                                 
2 1989 (4) SCC 187. 

Page 20 of 33 
 
Petition is dismissed in limine, there is no law laid down under the aegis 
of Article 141 of the Constitution. Hence, the judgement against which 
such petition was preferred becomes final and conclusive so as to 
operate as res judicata between the parties thereto. In stark contrast, 
the dismissal of Civil Appeal No. 8869/2003 by this Court vide order 
dated 08.12.2010 was not a dismissal simpliciter or in limine. Instead, 
the appeal was dismissed after taking into consideration the root-cause 
and consequential steps taken by the State towards rectifying the 
anomaly in the grant of revised pay scales.  To say it differently, the Civil 
Appeal was not dismissed on the premise that the judgement of the High 
Court dated 06.05.2002 was a correct statement of law. This Court in 
fact found that no issue survived for adjudication, for the obvious 
reason that the State Government had volunteered to redress the 
grievance of the Respondents and other similarly placed employees 
through the proposed Policy.  It is true that the Proposed Policy did not 
enure a decision binding on both sides for want of mutual consent. 
However, leaving aside a microscopic evaluation, this Court expressly 
approved the said Proposed Policy. The observation that nothing 
survived in the appeal for adjudication leaves no room to doubt that not 
only was this Court satisfied with the proposal mooted before it, it also 
bound down the State and commanded it to implement the same.   

Page 21 of 33 
 
41. 
Equally pertinent to note here is that this Court had granted leave 
and thereafter dismissed the Civil Appeal by way of a brief reasoned 
order.  Consequently, the High Court Judgment dated 06.05.2002 stood 
merged with the order dated 08.12.2010 of this Court.  In legal parlance, 
the High Court Judgment lost its entity and was subsumed in the order 
passed by this Court. 
42. 
The doctrine of merger although has its roots in common law 
principles, but has been deeply interspersed in Indian jurisprudence, 
through a series of decisions. This Court in Kunhayammed (supra) 
elucidated this doctrine which has been further affirmed and reiterated 
in Khoday Distilleries Ltd. (now known as Khoday India Ltd.) & 
Ors. v. Sri Mahadeshwara Sahakara Sakkare Karkhane Ltd., 
Kollegal (Under Liquidation) represented by the Liquidator.3 In 
Kunhayammed (supra), this Court has expressly laid down as follows:  
“ 42. “To merge” means to sink or disappear in something else; to 
become absorbed or extinguished; to be combined or be swallowed up. 
Merger in law is defined as the absorption of a thing of lesser importance 
by a greater, whereby the lesser ceases to exist, but the greater is not 
increased; an absorption or swallowing up so as to involve a loss of 
identity and individuality. (See Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. LVII, pp. 
1067-68.) 
 
44. To sum up our conclusions are: 
(i) Where an appeal or revision is provided against an order 
passed by a court, tribunal or any other authority before 
superior forum and such superior forum modifies, reverses or 
affirms the decision put in issue before it, the decision by the 
subordinate forum merges in the decision by the superior 
                                                 
3 (2019) 4 SCC 376 

Page 22 of 33 
 
forum and it is the latter which subsists, remains operative 
and is capable of enforcement in the eye of law. 
(ii) The jurisdiction conferred by Article 136 of the Constitution is 
divisible into two stages. First stage is up to the disposal of prayer 
for special leave to file an appeal. The second stage commences if 
and when the leave to appeal is granted and special leave petition 
is converted into an appeal. 
(iii) Doctrine of merger is not a doctrine of universal or unlimited 
application. It will depend on the nature of jurisdiction exercised by 
the superior forum and the content or subject-matter of challenge laid 
or capable of being laid shall be determinative of the applicability of 
merger. The superior jurisdiction should be capable of reversing, 
modifying or affirming the order put in issue before it. Under Article 
136 of the Constitution the Supreme Court may reverse, 
modify or affirm the judgment-decree or order appealed 
against while exercising its appellate jurisdiction and not 
while exercising the discretionary jurisdiction disposing of 
petition for special leave to appeal. The doctrine of merger 
can therefore be applied to the former and not to the latter. 
(iv) An order refusing special leave to appeal may be a non- speaking 
order or a speaking one. In either case it does not attract the doctrine 
of merger. An order refusing special leave to appeal does not stand 
substituted in place of the order under challenge. All that it means is 
that the Court was not inclined to exercise its discretion so as to 
allow the appeal being filed. 
(v) If the order refusing leave to appeal is a speaking order, i.e. gives 
reasons for refusing the grant of leave, then the order has two 
implications. Firstly, the statement of law contained in the order is a 
declaration of law by the Supreme Court within the meaning of 
Article 141 of the Constitution. Secondly, other than the declaration 
of law, whatever is stated in the order are the findings recorded by 
the Supreme Court which would bind the parties thereto and also 
the court, tribunal or authority in any proceedings subsequent 
thereto by way of judicial discipline, the Supreme Court being the 
apex court of the country. But, this does not amount to saying that 
the order of the court, tribunal or authority below has stood merged 
in the order of the Supreme Court rejecting special leave petition or 
that the order of the Supreme Court is the only order binding as res 
judicata in subsequent proceedings between the parties. 
(vi) Once leave to appeal has been granted and appellate 
jurisdiction of Supreme Court has been invoked the order 
passed in appeal would attract the doctrine of merger; the 
order may be of reversal, modification or merely affirmation. 
(vii) On an appeal having been preferred or a petition seeking leave to 
appeal having been converted into an appeal before Supreme Court 
the jurisdiction of High Court to entertain a review petition is lost 

Page 23 of 33 
 
thereafter as provided by sub-rule (1) of Rule (1) of Order 47 of the 
C.P.C.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
43. 
These decisions indubitably hold that if Special Leave was not 
granted and the petition was dismissed by a reasoned or unreasoned 
order, the order against which such Special Leave Petition is filed would 
not merge with the order of dismissal. However, once leave has been 
granted in a Special Leave Petition, regardless of whether such appeal 
is subsequently dismissed with or without reasons, the doctrine of 
merger comes into play resulting in merger of the order under challenge 
with that of the appellate forum, and only the latter would hold the field. 
Consequently, it is the decision of the superior court which remains 
effective, enforceable, and binding in the eyes of the law, whether the 
appeal is dismissed by a speaking order or not.4  
44. 
The High Court therefore fell in error on assuming that its 
previous decision dated 06.05.2002 was intact and enforceable, 
independent of the order passed by this Court in the Civil Appeal arising 
therefrom. On the same analogy, the High Court’s holding that its 
previous decision dated 06.05.2002 would operate as res-judicata, also 
cannot sustain being erroneous in law.  We say so for the reason that 
                                                 
4 Pernod Ricard India Private Limited v. Commissioner of Customs, 2010 (8) SCC 313.  

Page 24 of 33 
 
the final and binding order between the parties is the one dated 
08.12.2010, passed by this Court.  
45. 
We may now advert to the observations made by the High Court 
regarding the State allegedly rendering its order dated 06.05.2002 
nugatory through its executive actions.  The High Court, as a matter of 
principle, has rightly held that the State has no authority whatsoever to 
annul a Court decision through its administrative fiat. Even legislative 
power cannot be resorted to, to overrule a binding judicial dictum, 
except that the legislature can remove the basis on which such 
judgment is founded upon.  However, these settled principles may not 
be attracted to the facts and circumstances of the instant case.   
46. 
It goes without saying that the 2011 Order was issued by the State 
after this Court’s acknowledgement of the Proposed Policy initiated to 
rectify the pay scale anomaly. This Court, upon review, did not find fault 
with the proposed measures and instead, deemed them appropriate for 
addressing the prevailing pay discrepancy. Thus, the measures taken 
by the State were in deference to and not in defiance of this Court’s 
orders. To the extent above, the view taken by the High Court is legally 
and factually incorrect. 
47. 
Regardless to what has been held above, we are in agreement with 
the Learned Single Judge that the pay benefits which had been released 
to the writ petitioners arrayed before it, and who had meanwhile retired 

Page 25 of 33 
 
from service, ought not to have been withdrawn and that too with the 
added measure of recovery orders being fastened upon them. Such a 
recourse to effect recovery initiated by the State is contrary to the 
principles evolved by this Court in State of Punjab v Rafique Masih 
(White Washer) and others,5 wherein recovery from retired employees 
or employees who are due to retire within one year of the order of such 
recovery, did not get the seal of approval. Thus, to this limited context, 
the Single Judge’s direction deserves to be upheld. Ordered accordingly. 
48. 
Turning to the impugned order passed by the Division Bench of 
the High Court and as already recounted in the facts, the State’s intra-
court appeal has been dismissed on account of the inordinate delay of 
428 days in filing. The Division Bench observed that the plea taken by 
the State regarding movement of the file from one desk to another, 
particularly in the backdrop of the undertaking provided during the 
contempt proceedings, did not constitute sufficient ground(s) to 
condone the delay. The Division Bench accordingly rejected the 
application for condonation of delay and consequently dismissed the 
appeal. 
49. 
It is an admitted fact that the State authorities failed to avail their 
remedy of intra-court appeal within a reasonable time. It was only when 
contempt proceedings were slapped on them that the authorities woke 
                                                 
5 2015 (4) SCC 334. 

Page 26 of 33 
 
up and filed the appeal, which, by that time, was highly belated. This 
Court has in a catena of decisions elaborated the parameters and carved 
out such exceptional circumstances which may constitute a valid 
ground to condone the delay in the interest of justice. These principles 
include the recent approach that no undue leverage can be extended to 
the State or its entities in condonation of delay and that no special 
privilege can be extended to the State or its instrumentalities.6  
50. 
Nevertheless, the Courts have been cognizant of the fact that as a 
custodian of public interest, the affairs of the State are run and 
controlled by human beings. Various factors, including the bona fide 
formation of erroneous opinion, negligence, lack of initiative, lack of 
fortitude, collusion or connivance, red tapism, blurred legal advice etc., 
sway the action or inaction of these functionaries. While waiving the 
public interest vis-à-vis an individual’s interest who claims to have 
meanwhile acquired a vested right on the expiry of the limitation period, 
the courts invariably tilt towards the public interest, keeping in view the 
irreversible loss likely to be suffered by the public at large.7 Even in the 
case of private litigants, where the appellate court finds that the 
opposite party can be suitably compensated with cost measures, a

v. G. Arumugam (Dead) by Legal Representatives, (2015) 3 SCC 569. 

Page 27 of 33 
 
lenient and liberal approach is followed in terms of condonation of 
delay.  
51. 
We may, however, hasten to add that whether a just and valid 
ground for condonation of delay is made out or not, largely depends on 
the facts and circumstances of each case and no one size fits all formula 
can be applied in this regard.  It is, however, not necessary for us to 
further delve into this issue and/or determine whether the Appellant-
State has made out a case for condonation of delay in filing their intra-
court appeal before the High Court.  We rather proceed on the premise 
that even if it was a fit case for condonation of delay, will it serve the 
cause of justice to set aside the impugned order of the Division Bench 
and remit the intra-court appeal for a fresh adjudication on merits? 
52. 
We cannot be oblivious of the fact that the parties started litigating 
in the year 2002. The dispute had engendered out of a perceived pay 
anomaly. The State itself acknowledged that there was some disparity 
in the pay scales that needed to be rectified. Hence, it constituted the 
Rizvi Committee. That Committee made recommendations, which were 
broadly fair and just, as various means and measures were 
recommended to redress the grievances of employees like the 
Respondents. These measures included the merger of cadres, 
redesignation and upgradation of posts, the introduction of new pay 
scales, with an assurance that the redesignated posts would be on a 

Page 28 of 33 
 
pay scale higher than that of the feeder cadre. Even if these measures 
were not to the entire satisfaction of the Respondents, the fact remains 
that the anomalies stood removed. 
53. 
It needs no emphasis that prescription of pay scale for a post 
entails Policy decision based upon the recommendations of an expert 
body like Pay Commission.  All that the State is obligated to ensure is 
that the pay structure of a promotional or higher post is not lower than 
the feeder cadre. Similarly, pay parity cannot be claimed as an 
indefeasible enforceable right save and except where the Competent 
Authority has taken a conscious decision to equate two posts 
notwithstanding their different nomenclature or distinct qualifications. 
Incidental grant of same pay scale to two or more posts, without any 
express equation amongst such posts, cannot be termed as an anomaly 
in a pay scale of a nature which can be said to have infringed the right 
to equality under Article 16 of our Constitution. 
54. 
Equally well settled is that the creation, merger, de-merger or 
amalgamation of cadres within a service to bring efficacy or in the 
administrative exigencies, is the State’s prerogative. The Court in 
exercise of its power of judicial review would sparingly interfere in such 
a policy decision, unless it is found to have brazenly offended Articles 
14 and 16 of the Constitution. 

Page 29 of 33 
 
55. 
There was no pay parity in the instant case between Headmasters 
on one hand or the SDI/ABSA etc. on the other.  It was a mere co-
incidence that the group of these posts carried the same pay scale for a 
long time, till the State Government decided to grant a higher revised 
pay scale to the Headmasters.  This led to an anomalous situation as 
the Headmasters were amongst the feeder cadre categories for 
appointment by selection against 10% posts of SDI/ABSA.  Such an 
incongruent situation could be averted by amending the Rules and 
deleting Headmasters from the zone of consideration from 10% posts.  
In that case, the State would have faced no financial burden which has 
fallen upon it as a consequence to the implementation of the Rizvi 
Committee recommendations.  In other words, the aforesaid disparity 
could be removed without legitimizing the claim of the Respondents for 
grant of a pay scale higher or equal to that of Headmasters. 
56. 
Be that as it may, the Appellant-State on being directed by the 
High Court, agreed to recalibrate and recompense the employees like 
Respondents and put up a proposal before this Court in the previous 
round of litigation.  That proposal was indeed approved by this Court.  
The State in furtherance thereto issued the necessary orders granting 
restructured benefits to the employees like the Respondents.  Still 
further, the Respondents also got monetary benefits over and above the 
State’s proposal, in furtherance of the High Court decisions dated 

Page 30 of 33 
 
06.05.2002 and dated 02.02.2018.  Most of them have retired from 
service long back and are now senior citizens.  The monetary benefits 
have already been utilised by them on their personal needs.  
57. 
That being the state of affairs, it seems to us that remittance of 
the case to the High Court is not likely to bring quietus to the endless 
litigation. The party who gets aggrieved by the judgement of the Division 
Bench owing to the previous record will most likely approach this Court 
again. The litigation has taken its toll on the financial and health 
conditions of the private Respondents, in their old age.  We are, 
therefore, of the considered view that as long as the Respondents can 
be suitably compensated without subjecting them to any recovery and 
in such a manner that the relief so granted does not become a precedent 
for one and all to open a Pandora’s box and drag the State into a flood 
of litigation, it would be in the interests of one and all that such like 
litigation which has the potentiality of multiplying in the future, should 
be brought to an end without any delay.  
58. 
We, therefore, find it a fit case to invoke the extraordinary powers 
held by this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution. It is well settled 
that Article 142 empowers this Court to pass orders in the ‘larger 
interest of the administration of justice’ and ‘preventing manifest 
injustice’.8 This is more so in cases involving protracted litigation and 
                                                 
8 Nidhi Kaim v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2017) 4 SCC 1.  

Page 31 of 33 
 
delay,9 such as in the present case. It is a matter of common knowledge 
that the cases entailing discord over pay parity, are frequently subjected 
to prolonged litigation. These squabbles often lead to parties enduring 
significant challenges and hardships over extended periods as they 
await adjudication. Regrettably, the delay in resolving such matters 
usually renders them infructuous by the time a decision is reached.  
59. 
Thus, in light of the long pending litigation between the parties, 
the rights of the parties involved, and to give quietus to the issue, we 
deem it appropriate to pass orders towards doing substantial justice.    
CONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS  
60. 
We, therefore, allow this appeal in part and issue the following 
directions and conclusions by invoking our powers under Article 142 of 
the Constitution, for the removal of discrepancy in the pay scales 
prescribed for the posts of SDI/ ABSA and DBSA: 
i. 
The appeal is allowed in part. The Impugned Judgement of the 
Division Bench in its entirety and that of the Single Judge of the 
High Court in part, are set aside.  
ii. 
The 2011 Order is approved in its entirety.  
iii. The private Respondents and their colleagues in the same cadre 
(before and after the redesignation of their posts) are held entitled 
to the pay scale, strictly in accordance with the 2011 Order. The 
                                                 
9 Abbobaker v. Mahalakshmi Trading Co., (1998) 2 SCC 753. 

Page 32 of 33 
 
Respondents and other members of their cadre and all members of 
the Caveator-organization shall be entitled to the pay scale granted 
by the said Government Order, notionally from 01.01.2006 and 
actually from 01.12.2008.  
iv. However, any payment made to the Respondents more than what 
they are entitled to with effect from 01.12.2008, towards pay or 
retiral benefits shall not be recovered from them. The judgement of 
the Single Judge dated 02.02.2018, which set aside such recovery, 
is accordingly affirmed.  
v. 
The arrears of pay or pension, if not already paid, shall be paid to 
the Respondents or their colleagues in the same cadres within a 
period of four months along with interest @ 7% per annum. 
vi. Those who have retired from service, their pension and other retiral 
benefits shall be re-fixed accordingly, along with arrears with effect 
from 01.12.2008, to be paid within four months along with interest 
@ 7% per annum.  
vii. The 2011 Order is meant only for the officials belonging to the 
State’s Education Department, namely the Respondents and their 
colleagues of the same cadre. Employees of other Government 
Departments shall not be entitled to take benefit thereof as a matter 
of right. The benefits flowing from this order are also restricted to 
the employees like Respondents of the State Education Department 

Page 33 of 33 
 
and only to those who fall in the category of the posts that were the 
subject matter of consideration before the Rizvi Committee.  
viii. This order shall not be taken as a precedent by employees of other 
departments to claim revised or higher pay scales.  
61. 
The present appeal is disposed of in the above terms. Accordingly, 
pending applications are also disposed of.
