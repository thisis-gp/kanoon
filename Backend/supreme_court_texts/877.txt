PARWATIBAI & ORS.
RESPONDENT(S)
J U D G M E N T
B.R. GAVAI, J.
1.
Leave granted.
2.
This appeal deserves to be allowed on the short ground
that the second appeal, wherein the present appellant was
Respondent No.2, was decided even without giving notice to
the appellant herein.
3.
Shri  Atul  Babasaheb  Dakh,  learned  counsel  further
submits that even the questions of law which were framed by
the learned Trial Judge were framed during the dictation of
the  order  and  the  appellant  herein  did  not  have  an
opportunity of being heard.
4.
Such a practice by the High Court is deprecated by a
recent judgment rendered by this Court in the case of Suresh
Lataruji  Ramteke v.  Sau.  Sumanbai  Pandurang  Petkar  and
Others, reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1210.

The  impugned  order  is,  therefore,  set  aside  and  the
matter is remitted back to the High Court for deciding it
afresh in accordance with law.

Since the appeal arises out of a suit filed in the year
2009,  we  request  the  High  Court  to  decide  the  appeal
expeditiously, preferably within a period of one year from
today.
7.
The appeal is, accordingly, allowed.
