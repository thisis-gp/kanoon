2.           Both the above appeals arise out of the First 
Information Report1 registered as FIR Case No.227 of 
2017 at Police Station Pasi Ghat, District Siang East, 
Arunachal Pradesh for offences under section 
420/120B/34 Indian Penal Code, 18602 lodged by 
Mr. Anil Agarwal attorney holder for Mr. Okep 
Tayeng, the proprietor of M/s Shiv Bhandar. This FIR 
was registered against several named accused, 
details of which will be dealt with at a later stage and 
additional names surfaced during investigation. 
3.           Three of the accused namely Chandra Mohan 
Badaya and Respondent Nos.3 and 4 namely Shashi 
Natani and Rajesh Natani filed a petition for quashing 
the FIR before the Gauhati High Court registered as 
Criminal Petition No.91 of 2021. The said petition 
was dismissed by Gauhati High Court by judgment 
 
1 FIR 
2 IPC 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 3 of 19 
 
and order dated 24.06.2022. Aggrieved by the same, 
SLP (Crl.) No.7301 of 2022 has been filed by Chandra 
Mohan Badaya. Five other co-accused filed writ 
petitions before the Rajasthan High Court also 
praying for quashing of the same FIR No.227 of 2017. 
The details of three petitions filed before the 
Rajasthan High Court are as follows:

4. 
These three petitions were allowed by the 
Rajasthan 
High 
Court 
vide 
judgment 
dated 
23.05.2023. Aggrieved by the same, the State of 
Arunachal Pradesh has filed three Special Leave 
Petition Nos.8663-8665 of 2023. Interestingly the 
complainant did not come forward to challenge the 
order of the Rajasthan High Court quashing the 
proceedings. Since both the set of matters relate to 
same FIR, the same have been taken up together and 
are being decided by this common order.  
5. 
Brief facts giving rise to the present appeals are 
as follows: 
5.1. 
M/s Shiv Bhandar, the proprietorship 
concerned transferred an amount of Rs.1 Crore 
in the year 2016 in the account of Chandra 
Mohan Badaya, two of his proprietorships 
concerned and Rajesh Natani in four equal 
transactions of 25 lakhs each. According to the 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 5 of 19 
 
appellant Chandra Mohan Badaya, the amount 
was transferred as a loan, however, according to 
the complainant the said payments were made 
for purchase of land/building situate between 
plot No.A-47 to A-55, Sikar House, near 
Chandpole, Jaipur, Rajasthan. Relevant to 
mention here that there is no written agreement 
with respect to the purpose of the transfer of  
said amount, whether it was a loan or an 
advance towards purchase of land/building 
referred to above.  
5.2. 
According to Chandra Mohan Badaya, out 
of Rs.75 lakhs received by him and his two 
concerns, he repaid Rs.37 lakhs to the 
complainant 
from 
his 
personal 
and 
proprietorship accounts by way of bank 
transfer. This amount was repaid in 2016-2017. 
Further, according to Chandra Mohan Badaya, 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 6 of 19 
 
he executed two sale deeds with respect to two 
properties situate in Chaksu, Jaipur in favour 
of wife (Smt. Shalini Agarwal) and sister-in-law 
(Smt. Jaya Agarwal) , Shri Anil Agarwal, Power 
of 
Attorney 
holder 
of 
the 
complainant 
proprietor. Although the total sale consideration 
for both the sale deeds was Rs.1.08 Crores, out 
of which an amount of Rs.27 lakhs each i.e. total 
Rs.54 lakhs only was received by the petitioner. 
These sale deeds are dated 10.10.2016. It was 
much after all these transactions that the FIR in 
question was lodged on 23.11.2017 against the 
following persons: 
i) 
Sh. Chandra Mohan Badaya 
ii) 
Sh. Rajesh Natani 
iii) 
Smt. Shashi natani 
iv) 
Sh. Kishan Badaya 
v) 
Smt. Tina Badaya 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 7 of 19 
 
vi) 
Smt. Sushila Devi Badaya 
 
5.3. 
During investigation, some of the names 
mentioned in the FIR were dropped and others 
were added. Finally, chargesheet was submitted 
against eight persons: 
i) 
Sh. Chandra Mohan Badaya 
ii) 
Smt. Tina Badaya  
iii) 
Sh. Rajesh Natani 
iv) 
Sh. Pawan Agrawal 
v) 
Sh. Kamal Agrawal 
vi) 
Smt. Hemani Agrawal 
vii) 
Sh. Manish Kumar tambi 
viii) Ms. Alpana Tambi 
 
5.4. 
On the basis of the said chargesheet, 
cognizance was taken by the Chief Judicial 
Magistrate, Senior Division, Pasighat, East 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 8 of 19 
 
Siang district, Arunachal Pradesh, and a case 
bearing GR No.225 of 2017 was registered.  
5.5. 
As already noted above, two sets of 
petitions were filed before two different High 
Courts namely Gauhati High Court and 
Rajasthan High Court. The challenge before the 
High Court was primarily on two grounds, 
firstly, that no part of offence had been 
committed in Arunachal Pradesh as such there 
was lack of complete territorial jurisdiction for 
registration of FIR in Arunachal Pradesh. The 
Police ought not to have investigated the said 
matter for the reason that all the accused 
persons were residents of Rajasthan, the 
properties were situated in Rajasthan, the 
transfer by the sale deed with respect to the 
property was also in Rajasthan, even the power 
of attorney holder and the complainant were 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 9 of 19 
 
residents of Rajasthan and therefore, the FIR 
ought to be quashed on this ground alone.  
5.6. 
The second ground taken was that even if 
it is assumed that the State of Arunachal 
Pradesh would have jurisdiction to entertain the 
FIR and investigate, it was purely a civil dispute 
relating to transaction of funds and transfer of 
properties and being purely a civil/commercial 
dispute, the lodging of the FIR was just a misuse 
of the process of law and the same ought to be 
quashed, in view of the law laid down in case of 
State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal3. The Gauhati 
High Court dismissed the petition for quashing 
which has given rise to the appeal filed by 
Chandra Mohan Badaya whereas Rajasthan 
High Court quashed the proceedings which has 
 
3 (1992) suppl. 1 SCC 335 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 10 of 19 
 
given rise to the appeals filed by the State of 
Arunachal Pradesh.  
 
6. 
Before entering into the arguments advanced by 
the parties, we may briefly refer to the contents of the 
complaint being FIR No.227 of 2017. According to the 
complaint, Rajesh Natani and Chandra Mohan 
Badaya contacted the complainant firm requesting 
for amount of Rs.1 Crore for consideration /exchange 
of land/building situated between Plot No.A-47 to 
A55, 
Sikar 
House, 
near 
Chandpole, 
Jaipur, 
Rajasthan. The said amount was deposited in four 
instalments on 19.07.2016, 20.07.2016, 22.07.2016 
and 25.07.2016 in the accounts of Shri Ram 
Enterprises, A.R. Properties and Colonisers, Shashi 
Natani w/o Rajesh Natani and Chandra Mohan 
Badaya, as full payment for the sale of the aforesaid 
land/building. Thereafter, when the complainant 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 11 of 19 
 
visited the place of land/building, the accused 
persons refused to hand over the same. As such, it 
was clear that the accused persons had cheated 
resulting into suffering, mental agony, and financial 
loss. The accused persons failed to fulfil the above 
conditions of transferring the land. All the accused 
persons have conspired to cheat/commit fraud with 
the applicant. All the accused persons have earned 
huge amount through unlawful means and instead of 
fulfilling 
their 
promises, 
they 
threatened 
the 
complainant with consequences. Finding no other 
alternative, the FIR had been lodged for taking 
appropriate action against the accused persons.  
7. 
The 
FIR 
mentions 
the 
address 
of 
the 
complainant Mr. Anil Agrawal to be the address of the 
firm M/s Shiv Bhandar in Pasighat, East Siang 
District, Arunachal Pradesh. The residential address 
of the complainant Anil Agrawal is not given in the 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 12 of 19 
 
FIR. The address of all the six accused named in the 
FIR is that of Jaipur City, Rajasthan. The property for 
which the alleged payment of Rs.1 Crore is said to 
have been made is also situate in Jaipur, Rajasthan. 
The transaction of bank details is not mentioned in 
the FIR.  
 
8. 
Apart from the fact that the complainant is said 
to be placed at Arunachal Pradesh, no other fact 
relevant to the alleged offence is said to be in or 
within the State of Arunachal Pradesh but still the 
FIR had been registered there. Clearly, the reason for 
lodging the FIR was that the accused persons were 
not willing to execute the sale deed for which they had 
taken the sale consideration of Rs.1 Crore.  
9. 
The Gauhati High Court dismissed the petitions 
for quashing on the finding that no exceptional 
circumstances exist calling for quashing of the 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 13 of 19 
 
proceedings. Whereas, the Rajasthan High Court 
proceeded to quash the proceedings on the ground 
that no part of the cause of action had arisen in the 
State of Arunachal Pradesh rather entire cause of 
action was in the state of Rajasthan, hence, the 
Police/Court in Arunachal Pradesh lacked territorial 
jurisdiction to entertain the FIR and all subsequent 
proceedings.  
 
10. Surprisingly, 
the 
complainant 
M/s 
Shiv 
Bhandar has not come forward to challenge the order 
of the Rajasthan High Court. It is the State of 
Arunachal Pradesh which has challenged the order of 
the Rajasthan High Court.  
11. We have heard learned counsel for the parties 
and perused the material on record in both the cases. 
12. We are of the view that the matter was purely 
civil in nature. It was a case of money advancing for 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 14 of 19 
 
which no written document was executed to indicate 
its purpose or import as such whether it was a loan 
advance or an advance payment for transfer of 
property being land/building situate in Jaipur, is not 
borne out from any records. Such claim of the 
complainant that it was for transfer of property for 
land/building prescribed above, would be a matter of 
evidence to be led and established in the Court of law 
rather than the police investigating the same and 
finding out. It is not the case of complainant as stated 
in FIR that the plot/land as alleged by them which 
was to be transferred to them did not exist or had 
been sold or transferred to somebody else and 
therefore, there was an element of cheating by the 
accused persons. If the accused persons were not 
transferring the land and if the complainant could 
establish an agreement/contract with respect to the 
same in a Court of law, it ought to have filed a civil 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 15 of 19 
 
suit for appropriate relief. Appellant Chandra Mohan 
Badaya had already explained as to how he had 
already repaid Rs.37 lacs through bank transaction 
and also transferred two properties worth more than 
Rupees One Crore. All these aspects could be 
thrashed out before a competent Civil Court. It could 
not be said to be a case of cheating.  
13. A simple reading of the FIR itself does not 
disclose any cognizable offence for which the FIR 
should be registered and maintained. Although 
Chandra Mohan Badaya appellant has sought to 
explain that he had already returned Rs.37 lakhs by 
bank transfer to the complainant and had further 
executed two transfer deeds in favour of the wife and 
sister-in-law of Anil Agrawal, the power of attorney 
holder which valued at total amount of more than 
Rs.1.45 Crores. Even if we do not accept this 
contention as the same would be subject matter of 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 16 of 19 
 
evidence, what we find is that the complaint lodged 
by the respondent No.2 was not worth being 
registered as a complaint and that too in the State of 
Arunachal Pradesh.  
14. The High Court of Rajasthan had rightly found 
as a matter of fact considering all aspects of the 
matter that the offence, if any, although according to 
us, no offence is made out, would be within the 
territorial 
jurisdiction 
of 
Rajasthan 
and 
not 
Arunachal Pradesh.  
15. The State of Arunachal Pradesh ought to have 
been happy getting rid of an unnecessary Criminal 
Case being registered and tried in Arunachal Pradesh 
Why the State of Arunachal Pradesh has approached 
this Court is also a question to be answered by the 
said State when the complainant in a matter relating 
to civil/commercial dispute is not coming forward to 
defend its FIR which has been quashed by the 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 17 of 19 
 
Rajasthan High Court. Normally, in a given case 
where issue is of territorial jurisdiction we could have 
directed to transfer the investigation or the trial to the 
State where the cause of action would lie but in the 
present case, we find that no offence as such is made 
out.  
16. We are conscious of the fact that Pawan 
Agarwal, one of the Respondents herein in Criminal 
Appeal arising out of SLP No. 8663-8665/2023, had 
earlier filed Criminal Petition No. 110/2021 under 
section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. 
before the Gauhati High Court and the said petition 
was dismissed vide order dated 26.11.2021. We are 
also conscious of the fact that SLP (Crl.) No. 
999/2022 filed by him was dismissed as not pressed 
before this Court. However, today we are quashing 
the entire FIR Case No. 227/2017 registered at Police 
Station Pasi Ghat, District Siang East, Arunachal 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 18 of 19 
 
Pradesh and the consequential proceedings thereto. 
Rajasthan High Court, in the subsequent petition 
moved by Pawan Agarwal, has after noticing the 
proceedings initiated in Gauhati High Court has 
given relief to Pawan Agarwal and other respondents 
on the ground that no cause of action arose in 
Arunachal Pradesh. It is also important to note that 
after the Gauhati High Court had dismissed the 
Criminal Petition No. 110/2021 chargesheet was filed 
and we have considered the same. We have found the 
dispute to be of a civil nature and have quashed the 
FIR Case No. 227/2017. Hence, in exercise of the 
power under Article 136 of the Constitution of India 
we are not inclined to disturb the findings in favour 
of Pawan Agarwal in SB Criminal Writ Petition No. 
989/2022 
by 
Rajasthan 
High 
Court. 
Once 
proceedings are being quashed against all the other 
accused named in the FIR and in the chargesheet and 

SLP (CRL.) NOS. 8663-8665 of 20232  
 
Page 19 of 19 
 
considering the nature of findings we have recorded, 
proceedings against Pawan Agarwal cannot alone 
continue. 
17. We accordingly set aside the order of the 
Gauhati High Court and allow the appeal of Chandra 
Mohan Badaya and quash the entire proceedings 
arising out of FIR No.227 of 2017. We further dismiss 
the three appeals filed by the State of Arunachal 
Pradesh.
