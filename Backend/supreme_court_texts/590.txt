FACTUAL ASPECTS 
1. 
Criminal Appeal no.1451 of 2024 has been preferred by 
the State of West Bengal, aggrieved by the judgment and order 
dated 18th October 2023, passed by a Division Bench of the 
High Court of Judicature at Calcutta.  The learned Special 
Judge appointed under the Protection of Children from Sexual 
Offences Act, 2012 (for short, ‘the POCSO Act’), Baruipur, 
South 24 Parganas, convicted the accused for the offences 
punishable under Section 6 of the POCSO Act and Sections 
363 and 366 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short, ‘the 
IPC’).  For the offence punishable under Section 6 of the 
POCSO Act, the accused was sentenced to undergo rigorous 
imprisonment for twenty years and pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-.  
He was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for four and five 
years, respectively, for the offences punishable under Sections

363 and 366 of the IPC.  Though the learned Special Judge 
under the POCSO Act concluded that the accused was guilty 
of the offences punishable under clause (n) of sub-section (2) 
and sub-section (3) of Section 376 of the IPC, in view of the 
sentence imposed for the offence punishable under Section 6 
of the POCSO Act, no separate punishment was imposed. 
2. 
The victim girl was fourteen years old at the time of the 
incident.  The victim’s mother lodged a First Information 
Report (FIR) on 29th May 2018.  The victim’s mother stated in 
her complaint that the victim, who was her minor daughter, 
escaped from her home at 5:30 p.m. on 20th May 2018 without 
informing anyone.  On inquiry, it was found that the accused 
enticed her to leave her house.  The accused did so with the 
help of his two sisters.  The victim’s mother repeatedly visited 
the house of the accused and requested him to facilitate the 
return of her daughter.  However, the victim did not come 
back.  A female child was born to the victim.  Admittedly, the 
accused is the biological father of the child.  There was a gross 
delay in the investigation, and the accused was arrested on 
19th December 2021. The chargesheet was filed on 27th 
January 2022 against the accused for the offences for which 
he was convicted.  In addition, the accused was charged with 
the offence punishable under Section 9 of the Prohibition of 
Child Marriage Act, 2006.  The prosecution examined seven 
witnesses.  We may note here that as the learned Special 
Judge under the POCSO Act found that there was no evidence 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 3 of 50 
 
of marriage between the victim and the accused, the charge 
under Section 9 of the 2006 Act was held as not substantiated. 
3. 
By the impugned judgment, the High Court held that the 
offences punishable under Sections 363 and 366 of the IPC 
were not made out, and therefore, the High Court acquitted 
the accused for the said two offences.  Considering the factual 
scenario that the High Court noticed, it purported to exercise 
its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India 
read with Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 
(for short, ‘the Cr. PC’) to set aside the conviction of the 
accused for the offences punishable under Section 6 of the 
POCSO Act and sub-sections 2(n) and (3) of Section 376 of the 
IPC.  The High Court noted that the mother of the victim had 
disowned her and therefore, the victim was continuously 
residing with the accused along with their minor child. 
4. 
The Suo Motu writ petition was initiated based on the 
directions issued by the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India for 
challenging the impugned judgment.  The State Government 
has preferred the criminal appeal to challenge the order of 
acquittal. 
5. 
Considering the nature of the observations made by the 
High Court and the findings recorded by it, this Court 
appointed Ms. Madhavi Divan and Ms. Liz Mathew, the 
learned senior counsel, as amicus curiae to assist the Court.  
Both of them have rendered valuable assistance to the Court.  
Along with them, Ms. Nidhi Khanna, Advocate-on-Record, has 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 4 of 50 
 
also assisted the Court.  We have heard Mr.Huzefa Ahmadi, 
the learned senior counsel appearing for the State Government 
and the learned counsel representing the accused and the 
victim.  The learned senior counsel for the State Government 
has taken a fair stand.  The accused and the victim are on the 
same page and want to continue their cohabitation.   
ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE 
6. 
We have perused the evidence of the prosecution 
witnesses and the statement of the accused under Section 313 
of the Cr. PC.  From the statement and the evidence on record, 
it becomes an admitted position that the age of the victim on 
the date of the incident was fourteen years, and the age of the 
accused was about twenty-five years.  When the statement of 
the accused was recorded, the age of the victim’s daughter was 
about ten months.  Though it is the case of the prosecution 
that the marriage between the accused and the victim was 
solemnised on 20th May 2018 in a temple, there is no evidence 
adduced by the prosecution on this aspect. 
7. 
The evidence of the victim reveals that she also claimed 
that she married the accused.  She stated that her daughter 
was ten months old.  She stated in the cross-examination that 
she left her house of her own will and married the accused.  
She stated that since the year 2019, she has been residing in 
the house of the accused.  She stated in the cross-examination 
that she would like to stay in the house of the accused.   

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 5 of 50 
 
8. 
The first informant, the victim's mother, deposed that on 
20th May 2018, the victim was fourteen years and three 
months old. She produced the victim's birth certificate in the 
evidence. She stated that her daughter was kept in 
Narendrapur Sanlaap home, from where she was brought to 
her house. After staying in the house for a few months, she 
again went to the house of the accused. 
9. 
We are not referring to the medical evidence as it is an 
admitted position that the accused kept physical relations 
with the victim, and the victim has given birth to a female 
child.  There is no dispute that the accused is the biological 
father of the child.  There is no explanation for the gross delay 
in investigation and the delay in arresting the accused.  As 
stated earlier, the accused was arrested on 19th December 
2021.  Later on, he was enlarged on bail. 
GUILT OF THE ACCUSED 
10. 
Section 6 of the POCSO Act reads thus: 
“6. 
Punishment 
for 
aggravated 
penetrative sexual assault.— Whoever, 
commits aggravated penetrative sexual 
assault, shall be punished with rigorous 
imprisonment for a term which shall not 
be less than ten years but which may 
extend to imprisonment for life and shall 
also be liable to fine.” 
‘Penetrative sexual assault’ is defined under Section 3 of the 
POCSO Act.  In this case, there is no dispute about the fact 
that the accused committed penetrative sexual assault on the 
victim.  As the victim became pregnant as a consequence of 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 6 of 50 
 
the sexual assault, in view of sub-clause (ii) of clause (j) of 
Section 5 of the POCSO Act, it became a case of aggravated 
penetrative sexual assault. On facts, there cannot be any 
dispute that the commission of the offence punishable under 
Section 6 of the POCSO Act by the accused was duly proved. 
11. 
Under Section 375 of the IPC, having penetrative 
intercourse with a victim who is under 18 years of age with or 
without her consent becomes an offence of rape.  As the 
offence was repeatedly committed on the victim, clause (n) of 
sub-section (2) of Section 376 of the IPC is attracted.  
Therefore, the accused was liable to be punished in 
accordance with Section 376(2)(n) of the IPC.  Sub-section (3) 
of Section 376 provides for a minimum punishment of twenty 
years for the offence of rape when the victim is less than 
sixteen years of age. 
12. 
Section 361 of the IPC defines “Kidnapping from lawful 
guardianship”.  The said provision reads thus: 
“361. 
Kidnapping 
from 
lawful 
guardianship.—Whoever 
takes 
or 
entices any minor under sixteen years of 
age if a male, or under eighteen years of 
age if a female, or any person of unsound 
mind, out of the keeping of the lawful 
guardian of such minor or person of 
unsound mind, without the consent of 
such guardian, is said to kidnap such 
minor 
or 
person 
from 
lawful 
guardianship.” 
In the facts of the case, there is no evidence to prove that the 
accused took the victim out of the keeping of the lawful 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 7 of 50 
 
guardian.  Similarly, there is no evidence of enticing the victim.  
The mother of the victim deposed that the victim left her house 
on her own.  That is also the version of the victim.  Hence, the 
prosecution did not establish kidnapping.  Therefore, the 
offences punishable under Sections 363 and 366 of the IPC 
are not made out.  But, there is no doubt that the offences 
punishable under Section 6 of the POCSO Act and Sub-
sections (2)(n) and (3) of Section 376 of the IPC were made out.   
JUDGMENT 
13. 
When a Court deals with an appeal against an order of 
conviction, the judgment must contain (i) a concise statement 
of the facts of the case, (ii) the nature of the evidence adduced 
by the prosecution and the defence, if any, (iii) the 
submissions made by the parties, (iv) the analysis based on 
the reappreciation of evidence, and (v) the reasons for either 
confirming the guilt of the accused or for acquitting the 
accused.  The appellate court must scan through the evidence, 
both oral and documentary, and reappreciate it.  After 
reappreciating the evidence, the appellate court must record 
reasons for either accepting the evidence of the prosecution or 
for disbelieving the evidence of the prosecution.  The Court 
must record reasons for deciding whether the charges against 
the accused have been proved.  In a given case, if the 
conviction is confirmed, the Court will have to deal with the 
legality and adequacy of the sentence.  In such a case, there 
must be a finding recorded on the legality and adequacy of the 
sentence with reasons.  The ultimate object of writing a 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 8 of 50 
 
judgment is to ensure that the parties before the Court know 
why the case is decided in their favour or against them.  
Therefore, judgment must be in a simple language.  The 
conclusions recorded by the Court in the judgment on legal or 
factual issues must be supported by cogent reasons. 
14. 
No doubt, the Court can always comment upon the 
conduct of the parties.  However, the findings regarding the 
conduct of the parties must be confined only to such conduct 
which has a bearing on the decision-making.  A judgment of 
the Court cannot contain the Judge's personal opinions on 
various subjects.  Similarly, advisory jurisdiction cannot be 
exercised by the Court by incorporating advice to the parties 
or advice in general.  The Judge has to decide a case and not 
preach.  The judgment cannot contain irrelevant and 
unnecessary material.  A judgment must be in simple 
language and should not be verbose.  Brevity is the hallmark 
of quality judgment.  We must remember that judgment is 
neither a thesis nor a piece of literature.  However, we find that 
the impugned judgment contains personal opinion of the 
Judges advice to the younger generation and advice to the 
legislature. 
OBJECTIONABLE 
PORTIONS 
OF 
THE 
IMPUGNED 
JUDGMENT 
15. 
Ms Madhavi Divan, the learned senior counsel appointed 
as amicus curiae, has culled out the portions of the impugned 
judgment which, according to her, are highly objectionable.  
We are reproducing the same: 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 9 of 50 
 
i. "We feel it prudent to mention here 
that we noticed a rustic lady with a 
rumpled saree and unkempt hair, 
looking more aged than her age 
standing in a corner of the Court with 
a baby in her arms." (Para 2) 
ii. "[…]Non-exploitative 
sexual 
relationship without any intent is 
in rise among adolescents in our 
country. We may only say that may 
be for the reason of climatic change, 
change in food habits etc. girls are 
attaining puberty now-a-days in a 
younger age and sexuality develop in 
them very early may be owing to peer 
pressure, influence by social media, 
free availability of porn materials and 
free mixing with friends of opposite 
sex in a taboo free atmosphere. This 
being, however, sociological study by 
experts, we do not want to comment 
on these aspects. To top it all we do 
not want to go to the pathology of the 
offence(s) statutorily outlined in the 
POCSO Act." (Para 13) 
iii. "The discussion so far stresses on a 
"Rights based approach" so far as 
adolescents are concerned. We 
may sound narrow in our view, but 
the practicality of the facts is that 
a "Rights based approach" as a 
panacea for all the problems that 
come is not the solution, and in 
our view, not the just and correct 
approach. 
For 
conferring 
the 
Rights suggested in the aforesaid 
discussion 
on 
the 
"captioned 
group" i.e. adolescents between the 
age fold of 16 to 18 in "romantic 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 10 of 50 
 
relationship", some test are to be 
satisfied first. Those are: 
i) 
Whether 
conferment 
of 
suggested 
Rights 
on 
the 
"captioned group" is/are in 
their best interest? 
ii) Whether the captioned group 
has the discretion and maturity 
to use that Rights for their best 
interest? 
iii) Whether such rights at such 
age is conducive for over all 
development 
of 
their 
personality or it is destructive 
of their self development?  
iv) Who are the persons on 
whom such Rights are to be 
conferred, are they disciplined 
adolescents or a wayward lot, 
who have no control on their 
trivial urge to have sex? 
v) Whether conferment of such 
Rights on the captioned group 
is in the best interest of the 
society?" (para 29) 
iv. 
"To find answers to these tests 
opinions of some individuals, Rights 
activists, or view of so called liberals 
are not at all sufficient. [...]" (Para 
29.1) 
v. 
"Fundamental 
Rights 
in 
the 
Constitution 
and 
various 
other 
Rights in different statutes have been 
given to individuals for a balance in 
society, to check arbitrariness of the 
Government and development of best 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 11 of 50 
 
self of an individual. If we go deep into 
our old texts, we find that Rights are 
not conferred but they are earned by 
action of an individual. If we look at 
Bentham's theory, it is found that 
every 
right 
has 
corresponding 
duty/duties 
or 
obligation/ 
obligations. 
By 
performing 
the 
obligation, you have to earn the 
Right/Rights. It is somewhat similar 
to the old oriental philosophy "Do 
your duty and earn your Right." (para 
30) 
vi. 
"The principal androgenic steroid is 
testosterone, 
which 
is 
secreted 
primarily from the testes in men and 
ovaries in women and in small 
amounts from the adrenal glands, 
both 
in 
men 
and 
women. 
Hypothalamus and pituitary gland 
control the amount of testosterone, 
which is primarily responsible for sex 
urge and libido (in men). It's existence 
is there in the body, so when the 
respective gland becomes active by 
stimulation, sexual urge is aroused. 
But activation of the respective 
responsible gland is not automatic. It 
needs stimulation by our sights, 
hearing, reading erotic materials and 
conversation with opposite sex. So 
sexual urge is created by our own 
action. 
Sex 
in 
adolescents 
is 
normal but sexual urge or arousal 
of such urge is dependent on some 
action by the individual, may be a 
man or woman. Therefore, sexual 
urge is not at all normal and 
normative. If we stop some actions), 
arousal of sexual urge, as advocated 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 12 of 50 
 
in our discussion supra, ceases to be 
normal." (Para 30.1) 
vii. 
"Ask any parents of an adolescent, 
may be a boy or girl, you shall get the 
answer how difficult it is to give a 
right upbringing to him/her in view 
of free flow of negative materials from 
the web and social media, which 
hamper their thinking process and 
living. We, therefore, propose to 
take 
a 
"Duty/obligation 
based 
approach" to the issue in hand." 
(Para 30.2) 
viii. 
"It is the duty/obligation of every 
female adolescent to: 
(i) Protect her right to integrity 
of her body. 
(ii) Protect her dignity and self-
worth. 
(iii) Thrive 
for 
overall 
development 
of 
her 
self 
transcending 
gender 
barriers. 
(iv) Control sexual urge/urges 
as in the eyes of the 
society she is the looser 
(sic) when she gives in to 
enjoy the sexual pleasure 
of hardly two minutes. 
(v) Protect 
her 
right 
to 
autonomy of her body and 
her privacy. 
It is the duty of a male adolescent to 
respect the aforesaid duties of a 
young girl or woman and he should 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 13 of 50 
 
train his mind to a respect a woman, 
her self worth, her dignity & privacy, 
and right to autonomy of her body." 
(Para 30.3) 
ix. 
"[...] Similarly, parental guidance and 
education 
so 
far 
as 
boys 
are 
concerned is to include how to 
respect a woman; how to keep dignity 
of a woman; how to protect the 
integrity of body of a woman; and how 
to befriend a woman without being 
aroused by sexual urge even if there 
is advances from the other side till he 
becomes capable to maintain a 
family. [.]." (Para 31) 
x. 
"We do not want our adolescents to 
do anything that shall push them 
from dark to darker side of life. It is 
normal for each adolescent to seek 
the company of opposite sex but it 
is not normal for them to engage in 
sex devoid of any commitment and 
dedication. We want them to 
spread their wings high with a view 
to realise their best selves. Sex 
shall come automatically to them 
when 
they 
grow 
self-reliant, 
economically independent and a 
person which they dreamt one day 
to be. Along with sex in such a stage 
shall come love with commitment and 
dedication towards each other as 
they shall have the discretion and 
maturity to understand each other, 
adjust with each other and forgive 
each 
other. 
We 
beseech 
our 
adolescents to follow a salutary legal 
principle of Mahabharata "Dharmo

(one 
who 
protects law is protected by law) and

proceed 
in 
their 
path 
of

development 
without 
being 
influenced by bashful urge of urgent

xi. 
"So 
far 
as 
the

concerned it should better be left 
to the wisdom of the judiciary. 
Each judiciary in the world has the 
nicety of pluralism. Each individual 
judge has his/her own opinion. 
He/She has his/her own unique style 
of addressing an issue. [..] We are, 
therefore, of the view that the grey 
area of adolescent consensual sex 
about which much commotion is 
made should be left to the discretion 
and wisdom of the judiciary. It is also 
found from decisions of different 
Hon'ble

xiii. 
"In the present case things are even

15.1     We need not waste pages dealing with every 
observation/finding quoted above.  The observations are 
utterly irrelevant for deciding the controversy.  To say the 
least, these observations are shocking, which will ex-facie 
invite a finding of perversity.   
REASONS RECORDED BY THE HIGH COURT FOR 
ACQUITTAL 
16. 
Now, we come to the reasons recorded by the Division 
Bench.  The Division Bench has invited a very peculiar concept 
of “non-exploitative sexual acts” while dealing with the 
offences punishable under Section 376(2)(n) of the IPC and 
Section 6 of the POCSO Act.  We fail to understand how a 
sexual act, which is a heinous offence, can be termed as non-
exploitative.  When a girl who is fourteen years old is subjected 
to such a horrific act, how can it be termed as “non-
exploitative”?  In paragraph 17, the High Court refers to 
“marital rape”.  In this case, there is no evidence of marriage.  
The Bench has also invented a non-existent category of “older 
adolescents” and lamented about the lack of recognition of the 
consensual behaviour of older adolescents.  We fail to 
understand this concept of “older adolescents”.  Further, the 
Division Bench goes on to observe that sexual behaviour in 
adolescents, particularly from the onset of puberty, is 
established as being a natural, normative and integral part of 
an adolescent’s development.   
17. 
We must deal with some of the observations made by the 
High Court. The High Court concluded that by equating 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 16 of 50 
 
consensual and non-exploitative sexual acts with rape and 
aggravated penetrative sexual assault, the law undermines the 
bodily integrity and dignity of adolescents.  The High Court 
was not called upon to discuss the merits and demerits of the 
existing laws.  What is shocking is the observation made in 
paragraph 23 of the impugned judgment where the High Court 
observed that while achieving ostensible objectives to protect 
all children below 18 years from sexual exploitation, the law’s 
unintended effect has been the deprivation of liberty of young 
people in consensual relationship.  The Court, surprisingly, 
carved out a non-existing category of romantic cases in the 
rape cases.  While dealing with the offences under the POCSO 
Act, shockingly, the Court observed that the law undermines 
the identity of adolescent girls by casting them as victims, 
thereby rendering them voiceless.  The Court says that, on the 
other hand, adult boys are discriminately treated as children 
in conflict with the law.  Thereafter, in paragraph 25, the Court 
proceeded to criticise the POCSO Act by observing that it clubs 
all persons below eighteen years without considering their 
developing sexuality, evolving capacity and the impact of such 
criminalisation on their best interests.  In paragraph 28, the 
Court went further. It held that instead of protecting the 
adolescents from abuse, the law exposes them in factually 
consensual and non-exploitative relationships to the risk of 
criminal prosecution.  It compromises the mandate of 
protecting the children.  Therefore, the Court observes that an 
amendment is necessary to decriminalise consensual sexual 
acts involving adolescents above sixteen years. The High 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 17 of 50 
 
Court, while dealing with an appeal against the order of 
conviction, was not called upon to make the observations 
which we have referred to above. Perhaps these were the 
subjects on which only the experts could have debated at a 
different forum. The judges ought to have avoided expressing 
their personal views even assuming that there was some 
justification for holding the views. While the High Court 
observed this, it forgot that in the facts of the case, the Court 
was not dealing with the sexual acts involving adolescents 
above sixteen years, as the age of the victim was fourteen years 
and the accused was twenty-five years at the relevant time.   
18. 
In paragraph 29, the Court went into the question of 
rights based approach, which was completely unwarranted.  
In paragraph 30.1, the Court referred to the generation of 
androgenic steroids and secretion from the pituitary gland.  
Thereafter, the Court laid down the duties and obligations of 
every female and adolescent in paragraph 30.3, which we have 
quoted above.  No reasons are required to be recorded for 
holding that incorporation of the same in the judgment is 
entirely irrelevant and unwarranted.  After that, the Court 
proceeded to lay emphasis on incorporating the aspects of 
reproductive health and hygiene into the school curriculum.  
There are several statements and conclusions in the impugned 
judgment which, to say the least, are shocking.  Perversity is 
writ large on the face of the judgment, which can be seen in 
several paragraphs of the impugned judgment.   

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc.

19. 
The duty of the High Court was to ascertain on the 
evidence whether the offences under Section 6 of the POCSO 
Act and Section 376 of the IPC were made out.  In view of 
“sixthly” in Section 375 of the IPC, penetrative intercourse with 
a woman under eighteen years of age, with or without her 
consent, constitutes an offence of rape.  Therefore, whether 
such offence arises from a romantic relationship is irrelevant.  
How can an act that is an offence punishable under the 
POSCO Act be described as “a romantic relationship”?  The 
High Court went to the extent of observing that the case of 
criminalisation of a romantic relationship between two 
adolescents of opposite sex should be best left to the wisdom 
of the judiciary.  The Courts must follow and implement the 
law.  The courts cannot commit violence against the law.  The 
findings and observations in the impugned judgment, except 
the finding on the applicability of Sections 363 and 366 of the 
IPC, cannot be sustained. 
EXERCISE OF PLENARY POWERS TO QUASH THE ORDER 
OF CONVICTION 
20. 
Now, coming to the conviction of the offences punishable 
under Section 6 of the POCSO Act and Section 376(2)(n) of the 
IPC, the Division Bench proceeds on the footing that the said 
offences have been established.  However, the Court purported 
to exercise its “plenary powers” under Section 482 of the Cr.PC 
coupled with Article 226 of the Constitution of India to set 
aside the conviction of the accused.  In short, as we can see 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 19 of 50 
 
from the last few paragraphs of the impugned judgment, the 
High Court was swayed away by the following aspects: 
(a) There was a “non-exploitative” consensual sexual 
relationship 
between 
the 
two 
consenting 
adolescents; 
(b) The ground reality was that after the birth of the 
child, the accused is taking care of the victim and 
the infant/small child; 
(c) The victim has no support from her parents, and  
(d) A humane view is required to be taken to do 
complete justice. 
 
21. 
On a plain reading of “sixthly” in Section 375 read with 
Section 376(2)(n) of the IPC, notwithstanding the consensual 
sexual relationship, the offence punishable under clause (n) of 
sub-section (2) of Section 376 of the IPC, was made out.  One 
of the objectives of the POSCO Act is to effectively address 
sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children, as both 
offences are very heinous.  To give effect to the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of Children ratified by India on 11th 
December 1992, the POCSO Act has been enacted.  As noted 
earlier, in the facts of the case, the accused was not an 
adolescent, but his age was about twenty-five years on the 
date of the commission of the offence, and the victim was only 
fourteen years old.  When such offences of rape and 
aggravated penetrative sexual assault are committed,  by  

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 20 of 50 
 
exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution 
of India and/or Section 482 of the Cr.PC, the High Court 
cannot acquit an accused whose guilt has been proved. 
22. 
Perhaps the consideration of sympathy and the so-called 
welfare of the victim and her child prevailed on the Judges of 
the High Court. The Court was influenced by the fact that the 
victim’s parents did not support her, and therefore, by sending 
the accused to jail, she and her child would be miserable as 
the accused and his family were taking care of them. 
23. 
There are various decisions of this Court holding that the 
High Court can exercise jurisdiction under Section 482 of the 
Cr.PC to quash a prosecution on the grounds of settlement or 
by consent.  One such judgment is in the case of Gian Singh 
v. State of Punjab & Anr.1.  Paragraph 58 of the said decision 
reads thus: 
 
“58. Where the High Court quashes a 
criminal proceeding having regard to 
the fact that the dispute between the 
offender and the victim has been 
settled although the offences are not 
compoundable, it does so as in its 
opinion, 
continuation 
of 
criminal 
proceedings will be an exercise in 
futility 
and 
justice 
in 
the 
case 
demands that the dispute between the 
parties is put to an end and peace is 
restored; securing the ends of justice 
being the ultimate guiding factor. No 
doubt, crimes are acts which have 
 
1  (2012) 10 SCC 303 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 21 of 50 
 
harmful effect on the public and 
consist in wrongdoing that seriously 
endangers and threatens the well-
being of the society and it is not safe to 
leave the crime-doer only because he 
and the victim have settled the dispute 
amicably or that the victim has been 
paid compensation, yet certain crimes 
have been made compoundable in law, 
with or without the permission of the 
court. In respect of serious offences 
like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., or 
other offences of mental depravity 
under IPC or offences of moral 
turpitude under special statutes, 
like the Prevention of Corruption 
Act or the offences committed by 
public servants while working in 
that 
capacity, 
the 
settlement 
between the offender and the victim 
can have no legal sanction at all. 
However, 
certain 
offences 
which 
overwhelmingly and predominantly 
bear civil flavour having arisen out of 
civil, 
mercantile, 
commercial, 
financial, partnership or such like 
transactions or the offences arising 
out of matrimony, particularly relating 
to dowry, etc. or the family dispute, 
where the wrong is basically to the 
victim and the offender and the victim 
have settled all disputes between them 
amicably, irrespective of the fact that 
such offences have not been made 
compoundable, the High Court may 
within the framework of its inherent 
power, quash the criminal proceeding 
or criminal complaint or FIR if it is 
satisfied that on the face of such 
settlement, 
there 
is 
hardly 
any 
likelihood 
of 
the 
offender 
being 
convicted and by not quashing the 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 22 of 50 
 
criminal proceedings, justice shall be 
casualty and ends of justice shall be 
defeated. The above list is illustrative 
and not exhaustive. Each case will 
depend on its own facts and no hard-
and-fast category can be prescribed.” 
(emphasis added) 
23.1     Therefore, in view of the settled position of law, in the 
facts of the case, even if the accused and the victim (who has 
now attained majority) were to come out with a settlement, the 
High Court could not have quashed the prosecution. 
HELPLESS POSITION OF THE VICTIM 
24. 
The situation in which the victim was placed after the 
commission of the offence needs a bit of elaboration.  As noted 
earlier, the victim left her house on 20th May 2018, and her 
mother filed a complaint on 29th May 2018.  On 1st June 2018, 
PW-5 (ASI Gopal Chandra Saha) brought the victim from the 
house of the accused to the police station.  After her medical 
examination was conducted, she was sent for safe custody at 
Alor Disha Child Line at Champahati.  PW-2, mother of the 
victim, without giving any particulars stated that she got her 
daughter back from Narendrapur Sanlaap home.  She claimed 
in the cross-examination that the victim remained in her 
house for one year and, later on, went back to the house of the 
accused.  She admitted that she never went to the home of the 
accused, not even to see her grandchild.  The victim’s parents 
completely abandoned her, at least from the year 2019. 
25. 
Ms Madhavi Divan, the learned amicus curiae, rightly 
emphasized that no opportunity was made available to a girl 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 23 of 50 
 
of fourteen or fifteen years of age to make an informed choice 
to decide whether to stay with the accused.  She did not get 
any support from her parents and the State machinery when 
she required it the most.  As held by us hereafter, the State 
machinery failed to act according to the law to take care of the 
victim.  The situation in which she was placed at that time was 
such that she had no opportunity to make an informed choice 
about her future.   She had no option but to seek shelter where 
it was provided to her i.e. in the house of the accused.  In any 
event, it is doubtful whether she could have made an informed 
choice at the age of fourteen or fifteen. 
THE FAILURE OF THE STATE 
26. 
The question before us is whether the State was under 
an obligation to take care of the victim of an offence under the 
POCSO Act, who was fourteen years old.  Apart from the 
State's constitutional obligations, the statutes have enough 
provisions to address this situation.  Though the existing law 
of the land could have taken adequate care of the poor victim 
in this case, the machinery created by the law failed.  These 
conclusions need more elaboration.   
27. 
The first relevant statutory provision is Section 19 of the 
POCSO Act.  Section 19 of the POCSO Act reads thus: 
“19. Reporting of offences.— (1) 
Notwithstanding anything contained 
in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1973 (2 of 1974) any person (including 
the child), who has apprehension that 
an offence under this Act is likely to be 
committed or has knowledge that such 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 24 of 50 
 
an offence has been committed, he 
shall provide such information to,—  
(a) the Special Juvenile Police 
Unit; or  
(b) the local police.  
(2) Every report given under sub-
section (1) shall be—  
(a) ascribed an entry number 
and recorded in writing;  
(b) 
be 
read 
over 
to 
the 
informant;  
(c) shall be entered in a book to 
be kept by the Police Unit.  
(3) Where the report under sub-section 
(1) is given by a child, the same shall 
be recorded under sub-section (2) in a 
simple language so that the child 
understands contents being recorded.  
(4) In case contents are being recorded 
in the language not understood by the 
child 
or 
wherever 
it 
is 
deemed 
necessary, 
a 
translator 
or 
an 
interpreter, 
having 
such 
qualifications, 
experience 
and 
on 
payment of such fees as may be 
prescribed, shall be provided to the 
child if he fails to understand the 
same.  
(5) Where the Special Juvenile Police 
Unit or local police is satisfied that the 
child against whom an offence has 
been committed is in need of care and 
protection, 
then, 
it 
shall, 
after 
recording the reasons in writing, make 
immediate arrangement to give him 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 25 of 50 
 
such care and protection including 
admitting the child into shelter home 
or to the nearest hospital within 
twenty-four hours of the report, as 
may be prescribed.  
(6) The Special Juvenile Police Unit 
or 
local 
police 
shall, 
without 
unnecessary delay but within a 
period of twenty-four hours, report 
the matter to the Child Welfare 
Committee and the Special Court or 
where no Special Court has been 
designated, to the Court of Session, 
including need of the child for care 
and protection and steps taken in 
this regard.  
(7) No person shall incur any liability, 
whether civil or criminal, for giving the 
information in good faith for the 
purpose of sub-section (1).” 
                (emphasis added) 
27.1     Thus, under sub-section (6) of Section 19, it was the 
duty of the police to report the matter to the Child Welfare 
Committee (for short, ‘CWC’) and the Special Court within a 
period of twenty-four hours from the time the police had the 
knowledge about the commission of the offence.  There is 
nothing placed on record which shows that compliance was 
made by reporting the case to CWC.   
28. 
Section 27 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection 
of Children) Act, 2015 (for short, ‘the JJ Act’) provides for 
setting up the CWC.  The powers of the CWC have been laid 
down in Section 29 of the JJ Act, which reads thus: 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 26 of 50 
 
“29. Powers of Committee.— (1) The 
Committee shall have the authority 
to dispose of cases for the care, 
protection, treatment, development 
and rehabilitation of children in 
need of care and protection, as well 
as to provide for their basic needs 
and protection.  
(2) Where a Committee has been 
constituted 
for 
any 
area, 
such 
Committee 
shall, 
notwithstanding 
anything contained in any other law 
for the time being in force, but save as 
otherwise expressly provided in this 
Act, have the power to deal exclusively 
with all proceedings under this Act 
relating to children in need of care and 
protection.” 
(emphasis added) 
28.1     Thus, the authority of the CWC is to dispose of the 
cases for care, protection, treatment, development and 
rehabilitation of children in need of care and protection, as 
well as to provide for their basic needs and protection.  The 
authority conferred on the CWC creates a corresponding 
obligation. A child in need of care and protection has been 
defined under sub-section (14) of Section 2 of the JJ Act, 
which reads thus: 
“2. Definitions:-  
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 
.. .. .. .. 
(14) “child in need of care and 
protection” means a child—  
(i) who is found without any home or 
settled place of abode and without any 
ostensible means of subsistence; or  

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 27 of 50 
 
(ii) 
who 
is 
found 
working 
in 
contravention of labour laws for the 
time being in force or is found begging, 
or living on the street; or  
(iii) who resides with a person 
(whether a guardian of the child or 
not) and such person— 
(a) 
has 
injured, 
exploited, 
abused or neglected the child or 
has violated any other law for 
the time being in force meant 
for the protection of child; or  
(b) has threatened to kill, injure, 
exploit or abuse the child and 
there is a reasonable likelihood of 
the threat being carried out; or  
(c) has killed, abused, neglected 
or exploited some other child or 
children 
and 
there 
is 
a 
reasonable likelihood of the 
child in question being killed, 
abused, exploited or neglected 
by that person; or  
(iv) who is mentally ill or mentally or 
physically challenged or suffering from 
terminal or incurable disease, having 
no one to support or look after or 
having parents or guardians unfit to 
take care, if found so by the Board or 
the Committee; or 
(v) who has a parent or guardian and 
such parent or guardian is found to 
be unfit or incapacitated, by the 
Committee or the Board, to care for 
and protect the safety and well-
being of the child; or  

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 28 of 50 
 
(vi) who does not have parents and no 
one is willing to take care of, or whose 
parents 
have 
abandoned 
or 
surrendered him; or  
(vii) who is missing or run away 
child, or whose parents cannot be 
found 
after 
making 
reasonable 
inquiry in such manner as may be 
prescribed; or  
(viii) who has been or is being or is 
likely to be abused, tortured or 
exploited for the purpose of sexual 
abuse or illegal acts; or  
(ix) who is found vulnerable and is 
likely to be inducted into drug abuse 
or trafficking; or  
(x) who is being or is likely to be 
abused for unconscionable gains; or  
(xi) who is victim of or affected by any 
armed conflict, civil unrest or natural 
calamity; or  
(xii) who is at imminent risk of 
marriage before attaining the age of 
marriage and whose parents, family 
members, guardian and any other 
persons are likely to be responsible for 
solemnisation of such marriage; 
(15) .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . .. .. .. 
.. .. .. ..” 
(emphasis added) 
28.2     If a child is residing with a person who has injured, 
exploited or abused the child or has violated any other law for 
the time being in force meant for the protection of the child, 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 29 of 50 
 
the said child becomes a child in need of care and protection.  
Thus, if a child who is a victim of an offence under the POCSO 
Act is residing with the accused, the child becomes a child in 
need of care and protection.  Even a child who has a parent or 
guardian and if such parent or guardian is found to be unfit 
to take care of the child, in such a case, the child is covered 
by the definition under sub-section (14) of Section 2 of the JJ 
Act.  Therefore, the CWC has to exercise the power to provide 
basic needs and protection to such children in need of care 
and protection. 
29. 
Giving information of the commission of offence under 
the POCSO Act, as required by Section 19(6) of the POCSO 
Act, is not an empty formality.  The CWC has to immediately 
step in and take action as provided under Section 30 of the JJ 
Act, which reads thus: 
“30. Functions and responsibilities 
of Committee.— The functions and 
responsibilities of the Committee shall 
include—  
(i) taking cognizance of and receiving 
the children produced before it;  
(ii) conducting inquiry on all issues 
relating to and affecting the safety 
and well-being of the children under 
this Act;  
(iii) directing the Child Welfare Officers 
or probation officers or District Child 
Protection Unit or non-governmental 
organisations 
to 
conduct 
social 
investigation and submit a report 
before the Committee;  

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 30 of 50 
 
(iv) conducting inquiry for declaring fit 
persons for care of children in need of 
care and protection;  
(v) directing placement of a child in 
foster care; 
(vi) 
ensuring 
care, 
protection, 
appropriate 
rehabilitation 
or 
restoration of children in need of 
care and protection, based on the 
child’s individual care plan and 
passing necessary directions to 
parents or guardians or fit persons 
or children’s homes or fit facility in 
this regard;  
(vii) selecting registered institution 
for 
placement 
of 
each 
child 
requiring 
institutional 
support, 
based on the child’s age, gender, 
disability and needs and keeping in 
mind the available capacity of the 
institution;  
(viii) conducting at least two inspection 
visits per month of residential facilities 
for children in need of care and 
protection and recommending action 
for improvement in quality of services 
to the District Child Protection Unit 
and the State Government;  
(ix) certifying the execution of the 
surrender deed by the parents and 
ensuring that they are given time to 
reconsider their decision as well as 
making all efforts to keep the family

  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 31 of 50 
 
children to their families following due 
process, as may be prescribed;  
(xi) declaration of orphan, abandoned 
and surrendered child as legally free 
for adoption after due inquiry;  
(xii) taking suo motu cognizance of 
cases and reaching out to children 
in need of care and protection, who 
are 
not 
produced 
before 
the 
Committee, 
provided that such 
decision is taken by at least three 
members;  
(xiii) taking action for rehabilitation 
of sexually abused children who are 
reported as children in need of care 
and protection to the Committee by 
Special Juvenile Police Unit or local 
police, as the case may be, under 
the Protection of Children from 
Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (32 of 
2012);  
(xiv) dealing with cases referred by the 
Board under sub-section (2) of section 
17;  
(xv) co-ordinate with the police, labour 
department 
and 
other 
agencies 
involved in the care and protection of 
children with support of the District 
Child Protection Unit or the State 
Government; 
(xvi) in case of a complaint of abuse of 
a child in any child care institution, 
the Committee shall conduct an 
inquiry and give directions to the 
police or the District Child Protection 
Unit or labour department or childline 
services, as the case may be; (xvii) 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 32 of 50 
 
accessing appropriate legal services 
for 
children; 
(xviii) 
such 
other 
functions and responsibilities, as may 
be prescribed.” 
                    (emphasis added) 
29.1     Under clause (vi) of Section 30, it is the duty of the 
CWC to ensure care, protection, appropriate rehabilitation or 
restoration of children in need of care and protection based on 
the child’s individual care plan.  The CWC cannot wait till the 
children in need of care and protection are produced before it.  
Under clause (xii) of Section 30, the CWC must take suo motu 
cognizance of the cases and reach out to the children in need 
of care and protection.  What is important here is clause (xiii) 
of Section 30, which mandates that it is the duty of the CWC 
to take action for the rehabilitation of sexually abused children 
who are children in need of care and protection.   
30. 
Section 31 of the JJ Act reads thus: 
“31. Production before Committee.— 
(1) Any child in need of care and 
protection may be produced before the 
Committee by any of the following 
persons, namely:—  
(i) any police officer or special 
juvenile 
police 
unit 
or 
a 
designated Child Welfare Police 
Officer or any officer of District 
Child 
Protection 
Unit 
or 
inspector appointed under any 
labour law for the time being in 
force;  
(ii) any public servant;  

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 33 of 50 
 
(iii) Childline Services or any 
voluntary or non-governmental 
organisation or any agency as 
may be recognised by the State 
Government; 
(iv) 
Child 
Welfare 
Officer 
or 
probation officer; 
(v) any social worker or a public 
spirited citizen; 
(vi) by the child himself; or  
(vii) 
any 
nurse, 
doctor 
or 
management of a nursing home, 
hospital or maternity home:  
Provided that the child shall be 
produced 
before 
the 
Committee 
without any loss of time but within a 
period of twenty-four hours excluding 
the time necessary for the journey.  
(2) The State Government may make 
rules consistent with this Act, to 
provide for the manner of submitting 
the report to the Committee and the 
manner of sending and entrusting the 
child to children’s home or fit facility 
or fit person, as the case may be, 
during the period of the inquiry.” 
                 (emphasis added) 
30.1     Sub-section (2) of Section 31 confers power on the 
State Government to provide for the manner of submitting the 
report to the CWC and the manner of sending and entrusting 
a child to a children’s home or a fit facility.  The West Bengal 
Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2017 
(for short, ‘the WB Rules’) and in particular Rule 18, deal with 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 34 of 50 
 
the production of children before the CWC.  Section 32 of the 
JJ Act enjoins an individual or police officer to make a report 
regarding a child found separated from his/her guardian.  
Non-reporting is made an offence. 
31. 
Then comes Section 36 of the JJ Act which provides for 
inquiry to be made by the CWC on production of child or on 
receipt of a report under Section 31.  Sub-section (1) of Section 
36 provides that the CWC may pass an order to send the child 
to a children’s home or a fit facility or a fit person.  Sub-section 
(2) of Section 36 contemplates speedy social investigation by 
social welfare or child welfare officers.  The social investigation 
is required to be completed within fifteen days.  This enables 
the CWC to pass final orders.  After completion of the inquiry, 
the final order is to be passed in accordance with sub-section 
(3) of Section 36, which reads thus: 
“36. Inquiry.— 
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . .. .. .. .. . .. .. .. . .. 
.. .. .. ..  
(3) After the completion of the inquiry, 
if Committee is of the opinion that the 
said child has no family or ostensible 
support or is in continued need of care 
and protection, it may send the child 
to a Specialised Adoption Agency if the 
child is below six years of age, 
children’s home or to a fit facility or 
person or foster family, till suitable 
means of rehabilitation are found for 
the child, as may be prescribed, or till 
the child attains the age of eighteen 
years: 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 35 of 50 
 
Provided that the situation of the child 
placed in a children’s home or with a 
fit facility or person or a foster family, 
shall be reviewed by the Committee, as 
may be prescribed.” 
32. 
Then comes the crucial provision of Section 39 
incorporated under Chapter VII.  Section 39 deals with the 
process of rehabilitation and social re-integration, which reads 
thus: 
“39. Process of rehabilitation and 
social 
re-integration.— 
(1) 
The 
process of rehabilitation and social 
integration of children under this 
Act shall be undertaken, based on 
the individual care plan of the child, 
preferably through family based 
care such as by restoration to family 
or 
guardian 
with 
or 
without 
supervision 
or 
sponsorship, 
or 
adoption or foster care:  
Provided that all efforts shall be 
made to keep siblings placed in 
institutional or non-institutional 
care, together, unless it is in their 
best 
interest 
not 
to 
be 
kept 
together.  
(2) For children in conflict with law the 
process of rehabilitation and social 
integration shall be undertaken in the 
observation homes, if the child is not 
released on bail or in special homes or 
place of safety or fit facility or with a fit 
person, if placed there by the order of 
the Board.  
(3) The children in need of care and

placed in an institution registered 
for such children under this Act or 
with a fit person or a fit facility, on 
a temporary or long-term basis, and 
the process of rehabilitation and 
social 
integration 
shall 
be 
undertaken wherever the child is so 
placed.  
(4) The Children in need of care and 
protection 
who 
are 
leaving 
institutional 
care 
or 
children 
in 
conflict with law leaving special homes 
or place of safety on attaining eighteen 
years of age, may be provided financial 
support as specified in section 46, to 
help them to re-integrate into the 
mainstream of the society.” 
(emphasis added) 
33. 
There are various provisions, such as foster care, 
providing a sponsor to the children, etc.  Section 46 is another 
salutary provision that provides that any child leaving child 
care on completion of eighteen years of age may be provided 
with financial support to facilitate re-integration into the 
mainstream of society in the manner as may be prescribed by 
law.  Section 46 of the JJ Act reads thus: 
“46. After care of children leaving 
child care institution.— Any child 
leaving a child care institution on 
completion of eighteen years of age 
may 
be 
provided 
with 
financial 
support in order to facilitate child’s re-
integration into the mainstream of the 
society in the manner as may be 
prescribed.”

33.1     “After care” has been defined in Section 2(5) of the JJ 
Act. It is a provision for financial or otherwise support to 
persons in the age group of 18 to 21 years. Rule 25 of the WB 
Rules has been enacted to give effect to Section 46.  Rule 25 
reads thus: 
“25. After Care of Children Leaving 
Institutional Care.- (1) The State 
Government 
shall 
prepare 
a 
programme for children who have to 
leave Child Care Institutions on 
attaining eighteen years of age by 
providing for their education, giving 
them 
employable 
skills 
and 
placement as well as providing them 
places for stay to facilitate their re-
integration into the mainstream of 
society 
in 
consultation 
with 
concerned committees on After 
Care.  
(2) Any child who leaves a Child 
Care Institution may be provided 
after care till the age of twenty-one 
years on the order of the Committee

37 
and 
in 
exceptional 
circumstances, for two more years 
on completing twenty-one years of 
age. 
(3) The District Child Protection Unit 
shall prepare and maintain a list of 
organisations,

Board or the Committee and all Child 
Care Institutions for their record. 
(4) The Probation Officer or the Child 
Welfare Officer or Case Worker or 
social worker, shall prepare a post 
release plan and submit the same to 
the Board or the Committee, through 
the concerned committees on After 
Care, two months before the child is 
due to leave the Child Care Institution, 
recommending after care for such 
child, as per the needs of the child. 
(5) The Board or the Committee or the 
Children’s Court, while monitoring the 
post release plan will also examine the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
aftercare 
programme, particularly whether it is 
being utilized for the purpose for 
which it has been granted and the 
progress made by the child as a result 
of such after-care programme. 
(6) Children 
who are placed in 
aftercare 
programme, 
shall 
be 
provided 
funds 
by 
the 
State 
Government 
for 
their 
essential 
expenses; 
such 
funds 
shall 
be 
transferred directly to their bank 
accounts. 
(7) The services provided under the 
after-care programme may include:  
(i) community group housing on a 
temporary basis for groups of six 
to eight persons; 
(ii) provision of stipend during the 
course of vocational training or 
scholarships for higher education

for 
skill 
training 
and 
placement 
in 
commercial 
establishments 
through 
coordination 
with 
National

(vii) encouragement to sustain

institutional support. 
(emphasis added)” 
33.2     Section 46, read with Rule 25, is one of the most 
critical provisions that needs to be effectively implemented. 
Thus, the JJ Act has adequate provisions to ensure the care, 
protection, treatment, and rehabilitation of the victim of an 
offence under the POCSO Act. The ultimate object is to 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 40 of 50 
 
integrate the child in need of care and protection into society 
to lead a dignified and meaningful life.   
34. 
If sub-section (6) of Section 19 is implemented in relation 
to the victims of the offences under the POCSO Act and 
thereafter, the CWC strictly implements the provisions of the 
JJ Act which we have referred to above, no victim will face the 
situation which the victim in this case had to face.  The JJ Act 
is a complete code that makes provisions for the care, 
protection, treatment, and development of children in need of 
care and protection.  The JJ Act provides for making available 
their basic needs and protection.  The Act takes care of all the 
needs of the victims under the POCSO Act who fall under the 
category of children in need of care and protection.  The object 
is to undertake the rehabilitation and social re-integration 
process of such victims based on individual care plans as 
provided under Section 39 of the JJ Act.  Section 46 is a 
provision that requires the State Governments to frame rules 
to provide financial support to any child living in a child care 
institution upon completion of 18 years of age.  The financial 
support has to be very exhaustive as the object of financial 
support is to facilitate a child’s re-integration into mainstream 
society. 
35. 
However, at the grassroot level, sub-section (6) of Section 
19 is not being implemented.  Even if the information is 
provided to the CWC, the children in need of care and 
protection are not being produced before the CWC.  Even if the 
information is given under sub-section (6) of Section 19 of the 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 41 of 50 
 
POCSO Act, the CWCs are not taking any action, though, 
under clause (xii) of Section 30, CWC has the duty to take suo 
motu congnizance of the cases and reach out to the children 
in need of care and protection who are not produced before the 
CWC. Under sub-section (6) of Section 19, the police are under 
a mandate to report the matter to the jurisdictional Special 
Court or the jurisdictional Sessions Court, in the event the 
Special Court has not been established. On getting 
information, it will be ideal if the Special Courts or the 
Sessions Courts forward the information to the jurisdictional 
CWC. It is very crucial that sub-section (6) of Section 19 is 
scrupulously implemented and the CWCs take immediate 
action to protect the victim. Therefore, we are directing that a 
copy of this judgment should be forwarded to the Secretaries 
of the Law Department of each State and Union Territories.  
The Law Secretaries must coordinate with the concerned 
departments and ensure that the benefits of these statutory 
provisions under the JJ Act are extended to the victims of the 
offences under the POCSO Act.  The Secretaries will also 
ensure that the State Governments undertake the process of 
framing rules as required by Section 110(1), including the 
rules provided under Section 46, to make the measures 
provided under the JJ Act more effective. 
36. 
It is nobody’s case that, in the present case, recourse 
was taken to the provisions starting from sub-section (6) of 
Section 19 of the POCSO Act.  As these statutory provisions 
were overlooked entirely, a situation was created which did not 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 42 of 50 
 
allow the victim to make an informed choice about her future.  
She did not get that opportunity even after attaining majority. 
37. 
It is the responsibility of the State to take care of helpless 
victims of such heinous offences.  Time and again, we have 
held that the right to live a dignified life is an integral part of 
the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the 
Constitution of India.  Article 21 encompasses the right to lead 
a healthy life.  The minor child, who is the victim of the 
offences under the POCSO Act, is also deprived of the 
fundamental right to live a dignified and healthy life.  The 
same is the case of the child born to the victim as a result of 
the offence.  All the provisions of the JJ Act regarding taking 
care of such children and rehabilitating them are consistent 
with Article 21 of the Constitution of India.  Therefore, 
immediately after the knowledge of the commission of a 
heinous offence under the POCSO Act, the State, its agencies 
and instrumentalities must step in and render all possible aid 
to the victim children, which will enable them to lead a 
dignified life. The failure to do so will amount to a violation of 
the fundamental rights guaranteed to the victim children 
under Article 21. The police must strictly implement sub-
section (6) of Section 19 of the POCSO Act. If that is not done, 
the victim children are deprived of the benefits of the welfare 
measures under the JJ Act. Compliance with Section 19(6) is 
of vital importance. Non-compliance thereof will lead to a 
violation of Article 21. 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 43 of 50 
 
38. 
Unfortunately, in our society, due to whatever reasons, 
we find that there are cases and cases where the parents of 
the victims of the offences under the POSCO Act abandon the 
victims.  In such a case, it is the duty of the State to provide 
shelter, food, clothing, education opportunities, etc., to the 
victim of the offences as provided in law.  Even the child born 
to such a victim needs to be taken care of in a similar manner 
by the State.  After the victim attains the majority, the State 
will have to ensure that the victim of the offence can stand on 
his/her legs and, at least, think of leading a dignified life.  That 
is precisely what Section 46 of the JJ Act provides.  Sadly, in 
the present case, there is a complete failure of the State 
machinery.  Nobody came to rescue the victim of the offence, 
and thus, for her survival, no option was left to her but to seek 
shelter with the accused. 
39. 
We may note here that the Ministry of Women and Child 
Development, Government of India, has framed a scheme for 
care and support to the victims under Sections 4 and 6 of the 
POSCO Act.  The scheme is very exhaustive and even contains 
a provision for providing accommodation to girl child victims 
up to the age of eighteen years and aftercare support up to the 
age of twenty-three years.  It provides health services, 
counselling, and mental health services.  It provides for 
helping the victim to acquire education and vocational skills.  
Apart from the scheme mentioned above of the Ministry of 
Women and Child Development, Government of India, the 
National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) has come out with 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 44 of 50 
 
a Compensation Scheme for Women Victims and Survivors of 
Sexual Assault/other Crimes-2018.  Extensive benefits are 
made available to the victims of sexual offences under the said 
scheme. 
WHAT NEXT? 
40. 
At this stage, we may note that on 9th May 2024, the 
learned counsel appearing for the State has filed a written note 
which records the State’s assurance to support the victim.  In 
paragraph 5 of the note, the State has stated thus: 
“5. Such support is enumerated below 
only by way of illustration- 
a. That the State Govt is committed to 
finding a home for the victim 
(Mother) and the minor child in a 
safe environment and also provide 
for all the daily requirements. 
b. That the State shall further also 
coordinate with NGOs working in 
this space to prepare a work-cum-
life plan for the victim and the 
minor child in order to make her 
independent and ensure that she 
can make an informed choice about 
her and her child’s future and her 
stand in the present proceedings. 
c. Till such time that the victim is 
financially independent, state will 
provide for the educational need of 
the minor child. 
d. Any other logistical support that 
this Hon’ble Court may deem fit and 
appropriate.” 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 45 of 50 
 
40.1     We may note here that Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, the learned 
senior counsel representing the appellant-State in Criminal 
Appeal No.1451 of 2024, without taking instructions from the 
State, had earlier assured the Court to extend support to the 
victim in the manner mentioned above.  The State Government 
must support the victim’s child. In this case, there is a failure 
of the machinery under the JJ Act in the State to discharge its 
obligations to the victim.  Therefore, the State Government 
must go out of its way to help the victim. 
41. 
Now, the question is whether we can force the child to 
take benefit of the support extended by the State Government.  
It may be argued that it is too late for the State to come out 
with this offer.  Still, the Court must allow the victim to make 
an informed choice after being informed the details of the 
support that the State is willing to extend.  We must do so as, 
at no stage, she was given such an option and an opportunity 
to make an informed choice about her future.  Now, the 
question is how to enable the victim to exercise her option.  
This must be left to very qualified professionals/experts to 
ascertain her views.  This can be done by directing the State 
to constitute a team of two or three experts, including a clinical 
psychologist and a social scientist, who should meet the victim 
at a proper place and inform the victim about the offer of the 
State Government with all its material particulars.  The state 
government can get assistance from expert bodies like the 
National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences 
(NIMHANS) or the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) to 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 46 of 50 
 
constitute the team.  The experts will have to meet the child 
on multiple occasions.  While doing so, the experts will have 
to carefully ascertain the kind of support, if any, the victim 
and her child are getting from the accused and his family 
members.  For that purpose, the committee can seek the help 
of the local child welfare officer.  We must leave it to the 
committee of experts to decide how it will do the exercise.  The 
place, the time and the methods must be left to the Committee.  
The committee will have to perform its duties cautiously and 
sensitively.  The committee must ensure that this exercise 
does not make the victim more insecure. 
CONCLUSIONS 
42. 
Thus, to conclude, we hold that the accused is guilty of 
the offences punishable under sub-sections (2)(n) and (3) of 
Section 376 of the IPC and Section 6 of the POCSO Act. The 
issue regarding sentencing will be considered after the 
committee's report is received.  
43. 
This extraordinary situation was created because the 
State machinery did not follow the provisions of law starting 
from sub-section (6) of Section 19 of the POCSO Act. The 
importance of rehabilitation of the victims of offences under 
the POCSO Act, which is a mandatory requirement of law, is 
being overlooked by all stakeholders. Perhaps, at levels, there 
is a need for introspection and course correction. We include 
even the Judiciary in that. 
 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 47 of 50 
 
44. 
Hence, we pass the following order: 
(a) 
The impugned judgment of the High Court is set 
aside and the judgment of the Special Court is restored 
to the extent of the conviction of the accused for the 
offences punishable under sub-sections (2)(n) and (3) of 
Section 376 of the IPC and Section 6 of the POCSO Act.  
Accordingly, the accused stands convicted.  The 
acquittal of the accused for the offences punishable 
under Sections 363 and 366 of the IPC is confirmed.  The 
appeal is partly allowed.  The issue regarding sentencing 
will be considered after receiving the report of the 
committee in terms of clause (h) below. 
(b) 
We direct the Government of West Bengal to 
constitute a committee of three experts, including a 
clinical psychologist and a social scientist.  The State 
Government may take the assistance of NIMHANS or 
TISS for constituting the committee.  A child welfare 
officer shall be appointed to assist the committee as its 
coordinator and secretary; 
(c) 
The committee shall be formed within three weeks 
from today; 
(d) 
Within one week from the date of formation of the 
committee, the State Government shall provide all the 
material particulars/details of the benefits which it is 
willing to extend to the victim as stated in paragraph 5 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 48 of 50 
 
of the note submitted on 9th May 2024 by the learned 
senior counsel appearing for the State; 
(e) 
Thereafter, the committee shall meet the victim of 
the offences at such a place as it desires to communicate 
what the State Government is offering to her. The 
Committee must also inform the victim about the 
availability of the benefits of the scheme of the 
Government of India.  The duty of the committee shall be 
to help the victim to make an informed choice whether 
she wants to continue to remain in the company of the 
accused and his family or wants to avail of the benefits 
offered by the State Government.  This exercise will 
naturally require meetings with the victim on multiple 
occasions.  In what manner this task should be 
performed is left to the committee to decide; 
(f) 
The committee members must perform their duties 
very carefully and sensitively while ensuring that the 
victim does not develop a feeling of insecurity.  While 
doing the exercise, the committee will endeavour to 
carefully ascertain the kind of support, if any, the victim 
and her child are getting from the accused and his family 
members; 
(g) 
The State Government and its officials shall render 
all possible facilities and help to the committee 
members;  

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 49 of 50 
 
(h) 
The coordinator of the committee shall submit a 
report in a sealed cover to this Court by 18th October 
2024 through the Advocate-on-Record for the State 
Government.  The report can be a preliminary report or 
a final report.  The report should contain the details of 
the interactions with the victim and the opinion and 
recommendations of the committee.  The committee is 
free to give its opinion on the action which would be in 
the best interest of the victim and her child; and 
(i) 
We direct the Registry to forward copies of this 
judgment to the Secretaries of Law and/or Justice 
Departments of all the States and Union Territories. The 
Secretaries shall convene meetings of the Secretaries of 
the concerned departments and other senior officials.  
The object of holding such meetings is to ensure that 
appropriate directions are issued to all concerned to 
strictly implement the provisions of Section 19(6) of the 
POCSO Act and the relevant provisions of the JJ Act, 
which we have elaborated above.  The State/Union 
Territories must create machinery to do so.  The 
State/Union Territories shall also assist the victims in 
getting the benefits under the scheme of the Government 
of India and the scheme of NALSA, which we have 
referred to above.  In the meetings, the issue of framing 
Rules by the States to give effect to the provisions of 
Section 46 of the JJ Act, shall also be considered.  The 
Secretaries shall forward the compliance reports to the 

 
 
  Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) no.3 of 2023 etc. 
 
Page 50 of 50 
 
Secretary of the Ministry of Women and Child 
Development, Government of India, within a period of 
two months from today.  The Secretary of the Ministry of 
Women and Child Development shall compile the reports 
and submit an exhaustive report before this Court within 
three months from today.  A copy of this judgment shall 
also be forwarded to the Secretary to the Ministry of 
Women and Child Development, Government of India. 
45. 
To consider the report submitted by the expert 
committee and for considering the sentencing, list this 
petition/appeal on 21st October 2024 at 03:00 p.m. before this 
Bench.
