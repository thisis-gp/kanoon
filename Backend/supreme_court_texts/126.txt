Civil Appeal No. 722 of 2012 
3. 
 
In the case in hand, a Civil Suit1 was filed by the 
respondents for permanent injunction and for ownership and 
possession of the suit land. The Trial Court2 dismissed the suit, 
however, First Appellate Court3 accepted the appeal and decreed the 
suit restraining the defendants therein from interfering in the 
possession of the plaintiffs in the suit land. The appeal preferred before 
the High Court4 by the present appellants was dismissed.  It is the 
aforesaid judgment5, which is impugned before this Court. 
4. 
 
The respondents filed the suit on 10.05.1999 for permanent 
injunction against the appellants and also claimed ownership and 
possession of the suit land, situated at Mauja Madri, Savina Road, 
measuring 35x38 i.e., 1,330 square yards on which a room measuring 
20x30 feet had been constructed. It was claimed that the suit land was 
purchased by the respondents-plaintiffs from Panchayat Titardi on 
13.12.1959 and a boundary wall was constructed in the year 1960. The 
suit was filed as a notice was issued by the appellants under Section 
92A of the 1959 Act6.

3 
 
5.   
 
The stand taken by the appellants in the written statement 
was that the land in question is a Government land (Bilanam Sarkar) 
earmarked for grazing cattles (gochar land), which was forming part of  
Khasra No. 1163 ( old Khasra No. 838) in village Mauza Madri Menaria, 
Tehsil Girva. The Gram Panchayat, Titardi was not competent to grant 
lease in respect to the aforesaid land, especially when it was ear-
marked for grazing cattles. Notice was issued on receiving information 
that the respondents-plaintiffs had encroached upon the land. It was 
also pleaded that Gram Panchayat, Titardi was a necessary party but 
had not been impleaded. In the revenue record, the land was still 
shown to be owned by the Government. In case the claim of 
respondents-plaintiffs was that it was given on lease to them, there was 
no mutation entered on the basis thereof.  
6. 
 
The Trial Court framed six issues as extracted below: 
 
“1. 
Whether the land mentioned in para 1 of 
the suit is the land and house in the 
ownership and possession of the plaintiff? 
Plaintiff 
2. 
 Whether the defendants forcibly wanted to 
demolish the plaintiff’s house? Plaintiff 

4 
 
3. 
 Whether 
the 
plaintiff 
has 
tried 
to 
unauthorisedly acquire the land which is in 
the ownership of Nagar Vikas Pranyas? 
Defendant 
4. 
 Whether in absence of pleading the Gram 
Panchayat Titardi as necessary party, the 
suit of the plaintiff is not maintainable? 
Defendant 
5. 
 Whether the Gram Panchayat Titardi was 
not authorized to issue the patta in favour of 
the plaintiff, the patta issued in favour of 
plaintiff is forged? Defendant 
6. 
 Whether without declaration suit for 
injunction filed by the plaintiff is not 
maintainable? Defendant” 
7. 
 
Issues No. 1 to 3 and 5, being inter-related, were decided 
together. The respondents-plaintiffs had not been able to make out the 
pleaded case on the basis of evidence led by them and the same were 
decided against them. Issue No. 4 was decided against the plaintiffs 
and in favour of the defendants and so was the finding recorded on 
issue No. 6.  Finally, the Trial Court found that the respondents-plaintiffs 
were found to be in illegal possession of the land and were not entitled 
to the injunction prayed for. It was specifically noticed that the suit had 
not been filed for declaration as it was merely for injunction and the 

5 
 
encroachers on the land were not found entitled to the relief of 
injunction. 
8. 
 
In appeal before the First Appellate Court by the 
respondents, the findings recorded by the Trial Court were reversed 
and the suit was decreed. Even the issue regarding non-impleadment 
of Gram Panchayat, Titardi as necessary party in the suit was reversed. 
So was the position with regard to maintainability of the suit simpliciter 
for injunction without praying for relief of declaration. This is despite 
the fact that the respondents-plaintiffs had claimed their title or legality 
of possession on the land from the Gram Panchayat, which was not 
impleaded. 
9. 
 
The High Court upheld the judgment and decree of the First 
Appellate Court in an appeal filed by the present appellants. The High 
Court noticed that allotment of land in favour of the respondents-
plaintiffs in the year 1959 was proved with the evidence of two 
witnesses, who were members of the Gram Panchayat at the relevant 
time. The High Court also recorded that patta (lease) is in existence, 
which was granted by a statutory body, Gram Panchayat, Titardi. The 
respondents-plaintiffs were entitled to decree of permanent injunction. 
The suit simpliciter for injunction was held to be maintainable without 

6 
 
seeking declaration. The High Court found that no substantial question 
of law was involved in the second appeal. 
C.A. Nos.8977/2012, 468/2013, 524/2013, 467/2013 and 
Civil Appeal @ S.L.P.(C)No.25200/2013 
  
10. 
 
In the aforesaid bunch of appeals and the Special Leave 
Petition, in which leave was granted, the High Court had disposed of 
all the appeals, merely relying upon its earlier judgment dated 
14.07.2009 in S.B. Civil Second Appeal No.6/2008 titled as The 
Tehsildar, Urban Improvement Trust and another v. Late Smt. Ganga 
Bai Menariya through legal representatives.  The aforesaid appeal 
decided by the High Court is subject matter of consideration before 
this Court in C.A. No.722 of 2012, which is being dealt with in the 
present judgment. 
 
 
ARGUMENTS 
 
 
Civil Appeal No. 722 of 2012 
11. 
 
Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the 
findings recorded by the First Appellate Court, as upheld by the High 
Court, are erroneous. In fact, the judgment and decree of the Trial 
Court was passed while properly appreciating the legal position and 
the evidence produced on record. It is a case in which the respondents-
plaintiffs claimed that they had been granted patta (lease) of the land 

7 
 
by Gram Panchayat, Titardi in the year 1959 and on the basis thereof, 
they were continuing in possession. However, the fact remains that the 
land was still being shown in the ownership of the Government. It was 
ear-marked for grazing cattles (pasture land). The Gram Panchayat did 
not have any authority to lease out the same. It cannot even change user 
of the land. Simpliciter a suit for permanent injunction was filed without 
seeking a declaration of the rights vested in the respondents-plaintiffs 
on the basis of documents produced by them on record, which was not 
maintainable. Gram Panchayat, Titardi from which the respondents-
plaintiffs were claiming rights in the property, was not even impleaded 
as party. The patta (lease) in favour of the respondents-plaintiffs was 
sought to be proved merely by producing two witnesses, who were 
claimed to be the members of the Panchayat at the relevant time but 
not signatory to the document. The record from Gram Panchayat was 
not summoned. The High Court had failed to frame any substantial 
question of law. 
C.A. Nos.8977/2012, 468/2013, 524/2013, 467/2013 and 
Civil Appeal @ S.L.P.(C)No.25200/2013 
12. 
 
Additional argument raised in the bunch of other appeals 
was that the Gram Panchayat had granted patta (lease) in favour of the 
respondents therein in contravention of Rule 266 of the 1961 Rules7 in 
 
7 The Rajasthan Panchayat (General) Rules, 1961 

8 
 
terms of which the panchayat land could be sold by way of private 
negotiation only in case it was not possible to fetch reasonable price if 
the land was put to auction. Specific reasons were required to be 
recorded. The respondents-plaintiffs being in illegal possession of the 
land, notices were rightly issued for their eviction. It was after following 
the due process of law, which could not be challenged merely by filing 
a suit for injunction. 
13. 
 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents 
submitted that it was claimed that the respondents-plaintiffs had title of 
the property by way of lease executed by Gram Panchayat, Titardi on 
13.12.1959. It is claimed by the appellants that chunk of land was 
transferred by District Collector vide order dated 15.4.1989 to the 
Urban Improvement Trust for extension of abadi. It was said to be 
Government bilanam. There was no reference of gochar land, as is 
sought to be claimed by the appellants. Notice was issued to the 
respondents more than 19 years after the land was transferred to Urban 
Improvement Trust. As the respondents wanted to protect their right in 
the land as also possession, the suit was filed merely for permanent 
injunction as they had title of the property on the basis of patta 
executed by Gram Panchayat in their favour. There was no need to file 
a suit for declaration. The patta (lease) executed by the Gram 

9 
 
Panchayat was exhibited. It was issued by the Sarpanch in the presence 
of two witnesses. Both were examined as PW4 and PW5. The 
documents being more than 30 years old, there was presumption 
available under Section 90 of the 1872 Act8. There is no error in the 
judgment and decree passed by the First Appellate Court, as upheld 
by the High Court. 
14. 
 
It was further argued that on 17.10.2012, the State 
Government introduced a Scheme, whereby land in possession of 
persons prior to the year 1965 was being regularised. In terms of that, 
23.43 hectares of land in village Paneriyo Ki Madari was transferred by 
the appellants to Municipal Council, Udaipur vide letter dated 
29.01.2013. NOC was also issued by Municipal Council, Udaipur on 
04.04.2013 for issuance of patta under the State Grants Act, 1961 to the 
persons in possession of the land prior to 01.01.1965. Thus, in view of 
this subsequent developments, the appellants have nothing to do with 
the land in question. Number of pattas had already been issued in 
favour of occupants of the land. In fact, for part of the land in question, 
pattas have already been issued on 21.10.2012. The aforesaid Scheme 
i.e. known as ‘Parshashan Shehron Ka Sang Abhiyan, 2012’. It continued 
from time to time in the State till the year 2020-21. 
 
8 Section 90 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 

10 
 
15. 
 
It was further submitted that a clarification was issued by the 
State Government on 21.04.2022 regarding the Scheme of 2021 for 
issuance of free hold patta. As per the aforesaid clarification, the patta 
may be issued in favour of last purchaser in the absence of link 
document, who purchased land after 31.12.2018.   
16. 
 
Heard leaned counsel for the parties and perused the 
relevant referred record. 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
 
Civil Appeal No. 722 of 2012 
17. 
 
In the case in hand, the respondents claimed that they were 
given the land measuring 1330 square yards on lease by Gram 
Panchayat, Titardi on 13.12.1959. It is claimed that they were in 
possession of the land ever since then. The fact remains that no revenue 
record was produced by the respondents-plaintiffs to show that the 
land in question was ever mutated in their favour. In the evidence led, 
they were found to be in possession as even the case set up by the 
appellants is that they issued notice to the respondents-plaintiffs under 
Section 92A of the 1959 Act. To prove the lease in their favour, the 
respondents-plaintiffs had produced in evidence Ex.1, claimed to be 
lease deed dated 13.12.1959 executed by the Gram Panchayat in 
favour of late Ganga Bai widow of Jai Shankar Menaria. In the stand 

11 
 
taken by the appellants, the land being reserved for grazing cattles 
could not possibly be leased out by the Gram Panchayat. 
17.1   
 On one side, the plea sought to be taken by the 
respondents is that the document being more than 30 years old, there 
was presumption of truth in terms of Section 90 of the 1872 Act. This 
section provides that  if the document is more than 30 years old and is 
being produced from proper custody, a presumption is available to the 
effect that signatures and every other part of such document, which 
purports to be in the handwriting of any particular person, is in that 
person’s handwriting and in case a document is executed or attested, 
the same was executed and attested by the persons by whom it 
purports to be executed and attested. This does not lead to a 
presumption that recitals therein are correct. (Reference can be made 
to the judgment of this Court in Union of India v. Brahim Uddin and 
another9.  
18.   
Nothing was referred to by learned counsel for the 
respondents from the record to show the reasons for producing copy 
of the document in Court and not summoning the record from the Gram 
Panchayat to prove execution of the alleged lease in their favour. The 
contents of the documents were required to be proved. Effort was 
 
9 (2012) 8 SCC 148 

12 
 
made to prove the document by producing two witnesses. (PW4 and 
PW5 stated that the lease was granted in favour of the respondents). It 
was signed by the Sarpanch. There was no material on record to show 
that, except the oral statements of aforesaid two witnesses that at the 
relevant time, namely, in the year 1959, they were members of the 
Gram Panchayat otherwise the document Ex.1 (lease deed) placed on 
record by the respondents-plaintiffs as such does not contain their 
signatures. The document only contains signatures of some Sarpanch 
who had attested the same stating to be true copy. It was claimed that 
at the relevant time, Sarpanch was Kushal Singh, however before the 
evidence could be led, he expired and hence could not be produced 
in evidence. If the respondents-plaintiffs wished to prove the contents 
of the document in question, they could very well summon the record 
from the Gram Panchayat when a specific plea taken by the appellants 
was that the document was forged and the Gram Panchayat did not 
have competence to lease out the land.   
19.   
The respondents-plaintiffs while filing the civil suit did not 
implead the Gram Panchayat as party. In such circumstances, the 
respondents-plaintiffs were required to prove the document as the 
competence of the Gram Panchayat to lease out the land itself was in 
question. The Gram Panchayat could have filed the written statement 

13 
 
admitting or denying execution of the lease deed and place complete 
facts before the Court as per records.  
20. 
 
In the revenue record produced on record by the 
appellants, it is shown that the land in question was shown in ownership 
of Government (Bilanam Sarkar). Its new Khasra Number was 1163 and 
old Khasra Number is 838 in Mauza Madri Menaria, Tehsil Girva. As per 
jamabandi Ex. A-1, the land forming part of Khasra No. 838 was shown 
to be non-agricultural reserved for grazing cattles (shamlat deh). 
21. 
 
In the light of the aforesaid stand and the evidence led on 
record by the appellants-defendants, it was incumbent on the 
respondents to have proved their title on the land, which they failed to 
establish. As per the stand of the appellants, the respondents were 
encroachers upon the land for which notice under Section 92A of the 
1959 Act was issued to them. The same was replied to by the 
respondents stating therein that they have patta executed in their 
favour by the Gram Panchayat. 
21.1  
Further a suit simpliciter for injunction may not be 
maintainable as the title of the property of the plaintiff/respondent was 
disputed by the appellants/defendants.  In such a situation it was 
required for the respondent/plaintiff to prove the title of the property 
while praying for injunction.   Reference can be made to the judgment 

14 
 
of this Court in  Anathula Sudhakar v. P. Buchi Reddy (Dead) by Lrs. 
and ors.10 
21.2  
In view of aforesaid discussions, in our opinion, the 
judgment of the High Court suffers from patent illegality.    
Consequently, the judgment and decree of the First Appellate Court as 
well as the High Court are set aside and that of the Trial Court is 
restored. As a consequence, the suit filed by the respondents is 
dismissed.

22.1  
The Trial Court decided the suits vide judgment and decree 
dated 30.04.2008. The First Appellate Court decided the appeals vide 
judgment dated 19.04.2004. 
22.2   
Civil Suits were filed claiming that the land in question was 
leased out to the plaintiffs on 27.08.1985 (as is evident from the 
judgment of the Trial Court).  However, in the documents annexed with 
the I.A.No.148204 in C.A. No.8977 of 2012, the transaction is shown to 
be sale.  Though no prayer was made in the suit seeking a declaration 
as owner of the land as it was simpliciter for permanent injunction still 
the Trial Court framed the issue ‘whether the disputed plot is of the 
ownership and possession of the plaintiff’.  The second issue frame was 
‘as to whether the plaintiff is entitled to permanent injunction’.  Both the 
issues were taken up together.  While discussing the Issue no.1, the 
court recorded the ownership part was not to be gone into as it was 
merely a suit for permanent injunction but still it was to be considered 

16 
 
as to whether the possession was valid or not.  In support of his plea the 
plaintiff/respondent placed on record the document dated 27.08.1985, 
the lease deed.  However, the same was not proved.  The court also 
considered about the right of the Gram Panchayat to lease out the land 
with reference to the Rules applicable therefor.  Finally, the Trial Court 
came to the conclusion that no case was made out by the 
plaintiff/respondent.  Hence, the suit for permanent injunction was 
dismissed by the Trial Court on 30.04.2003.   
22.3   
The judgment and decree in all the suits were challenged 
by filing appeals.  The First Appellate Court without considering the 
fact as to whether the alleged lease deed Ext.E-1 was proved by the 
respondent-plaintiff in accordance with law, had shifted the burden on 
defendants to prove otherwise.  The issue regarding competence of the 
Gram Panchayat to lease out the land was just brushed aside.  The 
appeal was accepted and decree of permanent injunction was passed 
by the First Appellate Court against which the appeal(s) were filed by 
the present appellants before the High Court.  The same was disposed 
of in terms of the impugned judgment, though the issues were not 
identical. 

17 
 
22.4.  
It is admitted by all the respondents/plaintiffs in the bunch 
of appeals that the individual lease deeds were issued in their favour 
on 27.08.1985 by the Gram Panchayat.   
22.5.  
The stand of the appellants is that the lease deeds were 
executed in contravention of Rule 266 of the 1961 Rules, which provides 
that Panchayat may transfer any land by way of private negotiation in 
case any person has a plausible claim of title and auction may not fetch 
reasonable price, where for reasons to be recorded in writing, the 
Panchayat thinks that  auction would not be convenient mode for 
disposal  or where such a course is regarded by the Panchayat for 
advancement of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes or other 
Backward Classes. 
23. 
 
In Chapter XIII of the 1961 Rules, complete procedure has 
been provided for sale of abadi land.  
23.1   
Rule 255 defines ‘abadi land’ to mean nazul land lying 
within the inhabited areas of Panchayat circle.  
23.2   
Under Rule 256, a person desirous of purchasing the abadi 
land can file an application in writing along with requisite fee.  

18 
 
23.3   
On receipt of application, in terms of Rule 257, a plan of the 
land in question is to be prepared specifying the boundaries of the land 
to be sold. 
23.4   
After the plan is ready, local inspection of the site is to be 
made by three nominated Panchs who will submit their opinion on the 
following issues: 
(a)  
whether the sale applied for will affect the 
facilities for going and coming enjoyed by the 
villagers;  
(b)  
whether such sale will affect the rights of 
easements owned by other persons;  
(c)   
whether such sale will affect beauty and 
cleanliness of the locality; and  
(d)  
such other matters as may appear to be relevant 
(Rule 258).  
23.5   
A provisional decision is to be taken by the Panchayat as to 
whether the proposed sale should or should not be made (Rule 259).  
23.6  
If the decision is to sell the land, public notice is to be issued 
on Form ‘L’ inviting objections to the proposed sale (Rule 260).  
23.7   
Objections, if any, received are to be dispose of after 
affording opportunity of hearing to the objector (Rule 261).  

19 
 
23.8   
If no objections are received, the Panchayat shall pass a 
resolution and order for sale of the land by auction and date and time 
thereof shall be fixed (Rule 262).  
23.9   
The procedure for auction, deposit of earnest money, 
confirmation of sale have been provided in Rules 262 and 265. 
23.10  
Rule 266 provides for transfer of abadi land by private 
negotiations in certain specified situations, namely:  
(a)   where any person has a plausible claim of the title of 
the land and the auction may not fetch reasonable 
price;  
(b) where for the reasons to be recorded in writing, the 
Panchayat opines that auction may not be convenient 
mode for disposal of land; 
 (c) where such a course is regarded by the Panchayat 
necessary for advancement of Scheduled Castes and 
Scheduled Tribes or other backward classes; and  
(d) where the persons are in possession of abadi land for 20 
years or more but less than 42 years. 
24. 
 
In the aforesaid situation, the land can be transferred by 
passing a resolution by the Panchayat.  
25.   
Relevant Rule 266 is extracted below:  
 

20 
 
“266.  
Transfer of abadi land by private negotiation. – 
(1) The Panchayat may transfer any abadi land by way 
of sale by private negotiation in the following cases:- 
(a) Where any person has a plausible claim of title 
to the land and an auction may not fetch 
reasonable price; 
(b) where for reasons to be recorded in writing 
the Panchayat thinks that an auction would not 
be a convenient mode of disposal of the land; 
(c) where such course is regarded by the 
Panchayat necessary for the advancement of 
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes or 
other Backward Classes. 
(d) where the persons are in possession of the 
abadi land for 20 years or more but less than 
42 years, one-third of the prevailing market 
price and in case of possession of over 40 
years, one sixth of the prevailing market price 
shall be charged.

In Civil Appeal No. 8977 of 2012, originally the suit was filed 
by the respondent only for permanent injunction in the year 2002 with 
the pleading that on 09.02.2002, an employee of the Town 

22 
 
Improvement Trust visited the spot and threatened the respondent for 
forcible dispossession. Gram Panchayat, Village Kaladwas was not 
even impleaded as party. No declaration was sought that the 
respondent was owner in possession of the plot, hence she could claim 
injunction. The only evidence led was in the form of copy of lease deed 
dated 27.08.1985 where the plaintiff appeared as PW1. 
29. 
 
As recorded by the Trial Court, the respondents/plaintiffs 
had not been able to prove the document on the basis of which they 
were claiming a right of possession of the property in question.  Even 
if the aforesaid document is considered, the sale was clearly violative 
of Rule 266 of the 1961 Rules, under which aforesaid alleged lease 
deed/sale deed has been issued in favour of the respondents/plaintiffs.  
In terms of Rule 266 of the 1961 Rules, only in certain  specified 
situation, the land could be transferred by way of sale on private 
negotiation, namely, where any  person has a plausible claim of title to 
the land and auction may not fetch reasonable price or it may not be 
the convenient mode for disposal of land or where such a course is 
regarded by the Panchayat necessary for advancement of Scheduled 
Castes and Scheduled Tribes or other Backward Classes. Another 
situation envisaged is where the person is in possession of land for 
more than 20 years but less than 42 years. Nothing was produced on 

23 
 
record to show that the due process required for leasing out/sale of the 
land in favour of the respondents/plaintiffs by private negotiation was 
followed.  Gram Panchayat from whom the land was taken was not 
impleaded as party to admit or deny the allegations made by the 
respondents/plaintiffs in the plaint. 
30. 
 
For the reasons, mentioned above, we find merit in the 
present appeals.  The same are accordingly allowed.  The impugned 
judgments of the High Court as well as the First Appellate Court are set 
aside and that of the Trial Court is restored.  Resultantly, the suits are 
dismissed. 
31. 
 
Before parting with the order, we are pained to note certain 
facts which show total casualness on the part of the appellants.  As has 
been noticed above, in the bunch of five appeals bearing 
C.A.No(s).8977/2012, 468/2013, 524/2013, 467/2013 and Civil Appeal 
arising out of S.L.P.(C)No.25200/2013, challenge was to the order 
passed by the High Court in five different second appeals.  Five 
different suits were filed by five persons of the family which were 
assigned different numbers though decided on the same day by 
separate judgments.  Five different appeals were filed before the First 
Appellate Court and when the matter was taken to the High Court, five 

24 
 
different appeals were filed.  The same were disposed of on 
18.04.2012.   
32.   
When five different suits were filed by different persons 
while filing the documents with the paper book filed in this Court, it 
was incumbent upon the appellants to place on record correct copies 
of the judgments of the Trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court 
for each of the case.  However, it is evident from the paper books of the 
aforesaid five appeals that in all the appeals the Trial Court judgment 
placed on record was passed in Case No.60/2002 titled as Smt. Sumitra 
Devi w/o Radheshyam Tripathi dated 30.04.2003 and the judgment of 
the First Appellate Court placed on record in all the appeals is Misc. 
Civil Appeal No.01 of 2004 titled as Radheshyam son of  Bhagwati 
Prasad Tripathi dated 19.04.2004. The related judgments of the 
individual cases before the Trial Court and the lower Appellate Court 
have not been placed on record in the respective appeals.  With great 
deal of effort to join the loose ends, we could find out the details from 
the title of the impugned judgment of the High Court as the same 
mentioned the civil suit number as well as the appeal number in the 
First Appellate Court which was different in all five cases.  It is evident 
from the table enumerated in para 22 of the judgment.    We can only 
observe that the parties need to be more careful while filing the 

25 
 
pleadings in this Court and so the Registry of this Court as any error 
therein may be disastrous for any of the parties.
