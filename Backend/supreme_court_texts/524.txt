Preface: 
The ideas drawn from sacred texts of the world have 
proffered to worship and respect nature and impel mankind to 
preserve the same. This, in essence, is the doctrine of 
intergenerational equity.  
(i) The verses in Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana depict nature 
and its creations to embody the divine, as it states ‘Ether, 
air, fire, water, earth, planets, all creatures, trees and plants, 
rivers, and seas, they all are organs of God’s body, 
remembering this, a devotee respects all species”. 
(ii)  In all other faiths practised in India, the earth is deemed to 
be the sacred creation of God.  
(iii)  Nature and all her elements are considered sacred. Human 
beings are said to be composed of five elements of nature, 
which teach lessons and inspire strength in the formulation 
of our character:  
“Earth teaches us patience, love; Air teaches us 
mobility, liberty; Fire teaches us warmth, courage; 
Sky teaches us equality, broad-mindedness; Water 
teaches us purity, cleanliness.” 
 
 
1.1  Faced with the widespread destruction of the environment, 
people everywhere are coming together to understand that we 
cannot continue to use the benefits of the earth as we have in the 
past. A new ecological awareness is beginning to emerge which, 
rather than being downplayed, ought to be encouraged to develop 
into concrete programs and initiatives.

2. 
This Court, in State of Bihar vs. Murad Ali Khan, (1988) 
4 
SCC 
655 
(“Murad 
Ali 
Khan”) 
speaking 
through 
Venkatachaliah, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was) 
observed that “the tragedy of the predicament of the civilised man 
is that, ‘Every source from which man has increased his power on 
earth has been used to diminish the prospects of his successors. 
All his progress is being made at the expense of damage to the 
environment which he cannot repair and cannot foresee’.” 
 
3. 
This Court in M.C. Mehta vs. Kamal Nath, (1997) 1 SCC 
388 (“M.C. Mehta”), speaking through Kuldip Singh, J. observed 
that, “…the executive acting under the doctrine of public trust 
cannot abdicate the natural resources and convert them into 
private ownership, or for commercial use. The aesthetic use and 
the pristine glory of the natural resources, the environment and the 
ecosystems of our country cannot be permitted to be eroded for 
private, commercial or any other use unless the courts find it 
necessary, in good faith, for the public good and in public interest 
to encroach upon the said resources.” 
 
4. 
These writ petitions, filed in public interest in the years 
2004 and 2005, have been pending since then. However, IA No.47 
of 2016 and IA No. 122182 of 2021 were filed by the petitioner 
(Aruna Rodrigues) in Writ Petition (Civil) No.260 of 2005, leading 
to the hearing of the said applications and consequently, the writ 
petitions also. 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 9 of 260 
 
 
 
The catalyst for considering these writ petitions on merits is 
the approval of Genetic Engineering Approval (now Appraisal) 
Committee (GEAC) dated 18.10.2022 culminating in the decision 
dated 25.10.2022 being questioned by the petitioners. It would 
therefore be useful to initially state the bird’s eye view of the 
controversy. 
 
Bird’s eye view of the controversy:  
5.  
What does it mean to preserve, protect and respect the 
citizens’ right to a safe and healthy environment while exploring 
and experimenting with era-altering novel technologies? That is 
the crux of the controversy in these cases. The factual aspects of 
the controversy were crystallised to some extent when this Court 
had set up Technical Expert Committee (TEC) on 10.05.2012.  
 
5.1  In the immediate context, these cases impugn the decision 
taken by GEAC to grant approval for environmental release of 
Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11 (DMH-11) mustard at the 147th 
meeting held on 18.10.2022. Whether the said approval was in 
compliance or in derogation of the recommendations of the TEC 
Report is a foundational aspect. Whether the said decision is in 
consonance with due process of law, as understood in the 
context of the public trust doctrine? There is also the question 
whether the right to a safe and healthy environment under 
Article 21 has been violated and whether there has been a 
violation of the precautionary principle.  
 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 10 of 260 
 
 
 
5.2 In these cases, the said controversy has been considered 
from several angles. Arguments at length have been heard by us. 
Therefore, we propose to encapsulate the pleadings, arguments 
and voluminous materials that has been submitted during the 
course of the hearing while arriving at the findings and 
conclusion in this matter.  
 
Pleadings: 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004: 
6.  
According to petitioner in Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 
2004, namely, Gene Campaign, it is a society registered under 
the Societies Registration Act, 1860. It consists of lawyers, 
geneticists, 
social 
scientists, 
agriculturalists, 
economists, 
environmentalists, farmers etc. who work towards the cause of 
protecting genetic resources and ensuring that the rights of rural 
and tribal communities to access the same are not infringed. 
Petitioner No.2, Dr. Suman Sahai is the President of Gene 
Campaign, a researcher and instructor in several institutions in 
India and abroad. It is his considered opinion that the use of 
Gene Modification (GM) technology must not be permissible 
without having the requisite safeguards and regulatory regimes 
in place.  
 
6.1 The prayers in Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 filed by 
the petitioners read as under: 
 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 11 of 260 
 
 
 
“The petitioner therefore, prays that in the facts and 
circumstances of the present case, this Hon’ble Court 
may be pleased to issue a writ of mandamus or writ or 
direction of like nature to: 
i) direct the respondents to bring the Rules for 
Manufacture, Use, Import, Export and the Storage of 
Hazardous Micro-organisms, Genetically Engineered 
Organisms or Cells, 1989 in consonance with Article 14, 
19, 21, 38, 47, 48, 48A read with 51-A(g) of the 
Constitution and in the eventuality of the respondents 
failing to do so, declare the Rules of 1989 as 
unconstitutional; 
ii) direct the Respondents to set-up a High-Power 
Committee to formulate a National Policy on Genetically 
Engineered 
Organisms 
(GEOs) 
through 
a 
multi-
stakeholder consultation process; 
iii) direct the Respondents to observe a moratorium on 
various permissions/approvals/trials concerning GEOs, 
in particular of commercial nature, particularly of crops 
for which India is a Centre of Origin/Diversity, till the 
Rules are amended and a sound Regulatory and 
Monitoring System is put in place; 
iv) pass such other and further orders as this Hon’ble 
Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and 
circumstances of the case.” 
 
 
7.  
The pleadings in the aforesaid writ petition could be 
encapsulated as under:  
 
7.1  Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 has been filed for the 
issuance of a writ of mandamus or similar writ directing the 
respondent-State to bring the Rules for the Manufacture, Use, 
Import, Export and Storage of Hazardous Micro-Organisms, 
Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells, 1989 (“the 1989 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 12 of 260 
 
 
 
Rules”, for the sake of convenience), which have been framed 
under Sections 6, 8 and 25 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 
1986 (“EP Act, 1986”, for short) in consonance with Articles 14, 
19, 21, 38, 47, 48, 48A read with Article 51-A(g) of the 
Constitution and if there is a failure to do so, to declare the said 
Rules as unconstitutional. It is averred that this Court has on 
various occasions interpreted Article 21 of the Constitution to 
include the right to health of the individual as well as to a clean 
and safe environment. That tenets of the precautionary principle, 
sustainable development, polluter pays principle and inter-
generational equity doctrine have been held by this Court to form 
a part of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. That there is a 
need for the 1989 Rules to be in accordance with the aforesaid 
principles so as to be held constitutional. That the public need 
to be provided sufficient opportunity to participate in the process 
of decision-making when there is an actual or likely possibility of 
their 
fundamental 
rights 
being 
affected 
and 
necessary 
information needs to be made available to facilitate the same.  
The said right has been recognized by the decision of this Court 
in Research Foundation for Science Technology National 
Resource Policy vs. Union of India, (2003) 9 SCALE 303 : 
(2005) 10 SCC 510 (“RFSTE”).  
 
7.2  It is further averred that the 1989 Rules as they exist are 
not in conformity with established principles of environmental 
law as elucidated by this Court. The 1989 Rules are also stated 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 13 of 260 
 
 
 
to be not in conformity with international instruments such as 
the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Cartagena 
Protocol on Biosafety (CPB), that have been ratified by India. 
That, a reading of these along with the fundamental rights 
conferred by the Constitution would serve the purpose of 
furthering the said rights and such an approach should be 
adopted by this Court.  
 
7.3  That Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are an 
emerging area of research and study but the 1989 Rules are still 
inadequate to meet the challenges of the limited findings and 
evidence that are a product of this research. That overseas 
jurisdictions have established robust regimes that regulate 
GMOs, in recognition of the risk they may pose to the 
environment. But the 1989 Rules as they stand do not appear to 
contain any of the safeguards found in the regulatory regimes of 
other jurisdictions.  The aforesaid absence of safeguards has 
contributed to India being used as a “dumping ground” and the 
Country being used to test experimental crop varieties that have 
not been sufficiently studied, with these possibly posing a 
serious risk to the country’s biodiversity. That this would directly 
impact the economic prospects of a large section of the 
population that works in the agricultural sector and could 
further harm the country’s food security. Small and marginal 
farmers are to be the most disadvantaged in the aforesaid 
scenario.  
 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 14 of 260 
 
 
 
7.4  That the 1989 Rules were enacted owing to mounting 
evidence of the possible adverse effects of GMOs on agricultural 
ecosystems and the country’s biodiversity as well as on human 
and animal health. It is the petitioners’ case that the said Rules 
are riddled with lacunae that lead to them being applied 
arbitrarily and in violation of the Constitution. That the said 
Rules do not bear any mention as to the qualifications required 
to be eligible for membership in the various regulatory agencies 
constituted thereunder. This renders the functioning of these 
agencies largely ineffective as they often lack the necessary 
technical competence, particularly in the fields of Risk 
Assessment and Risk Management (RARM).  
 
7.5  Further, the prescribed constitution of various agencies, in 
particular those of the Review Committee on Genetic 
Manipulation (RCGM), GEAC, the State Biotechnology Co-
ordination Committees (SBCC) and District Level Committees 
(DLC), include representatives of various authorities who do not 
possess the necessary qualifications, technical expertise, 
competence, skills and knowledge to carry out the respective 
mandates of each agency. Majority of the members are only in 
ex-officio capacity and lack competence in the field of operation. 
 
7.6  That, there is a complete lack of transparency at each stage 
of the regulatory process. The 1989 Rules do not allow for public 
to access information despite GMOs having possible adverse 
effects on human and animal health, socio-economic conditions 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 15 of 260 
 
 
 
as well as the environment which directly pertains to the public’s 
rights and interests. These Rules do not allow public to 
sufficiently participate in the decision-making at any stage, viz. 
grant of approval for research, field trials or commercial-scale 
cultivation of a GM crop. Public participation is needed to both 
accurately gauge the risks and benefits as well as to increase the 
confidence of public in GMOs.  
 
7.7  That the 1989 Rules do not require taking prior informed 
consent from those farmers and Gram Sabhas which are located 
in the vicinity where a field trial would be conducted. This is in 
violation of the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments which 
make the involvement of Gram Sabhas and Gram Panchayats in 
such decisions necessary and non-optional.   
 
7.8  That the Rules envision a regulatory regime that lacks 
accountability and there is no indication as to who would bear 
the liability in case of an erroneous decision being made that has 
an adverse impact on human and animal health, the 
environment and the socio-economic conditions of the country. 
Such harm may take the form of personal injury, property 
damage or financial loss, however, the liability corresponding to 
each of these has not been considered in the 1989 Rules at all.  
 
7.9  Further, the penal provisions contained in the said Rules 
do not sufficiently deter prospective offenders as these provisions 
just mention “measures” that may be taken by the concerned 
agency, which do not include the description of a penalty of any 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 16 of 260 
 
 
 
kind. The actions that can be taken by the concerned agencies 
are only in a corrective capacity to ensure damage is minimized.  
 
7.10   That neither SBCC nor DLC had been made functional at 
the time of filing of this Petition despite the commercial 
cultivation of the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton crop which is 
a GMO.  
 
7.11   That GM technology is an emerging technology that 
enables outcomes that were hitherto unimagined such as the 
transposition of the genes of fish into those of tomatoes, genes of 
bacteria into those of plants etc. There is an inherent uncertainty 
to this technology and its effect on the environment and on 
human life. This necessitates the re-examination of extant 
regulations and regulatory regimes so as to mould them in light 
of newer developments.  
 
7.12 That till these uncertainties have been clarified through the 
process of scientific research thereby enabling a thorough 
consideration of the risks and benefits, there must be a 
moratorium on the commercial release of GMOs.    
 
7.13 That the impact of GM technology would vary based on the 
socio-economic, cultural, and ecological context of each country 
and any research conducted must evaluate the specific impact of 
such technology in the Indian context. On the other hand, GM 
technology have evolved in industrialized and developed 
economies with highly mechanized agricultural processes and

vast monocultural tracts that are generally isolated from natural 
ecosystems. Unlike India, these countries do not possess 
similarly rich biodiversity. 
 
7.14  That India, being the centre of origin for many food crops, 
has to be more vigilant and cautious in adopting this new 
technology which is still in the process of evolution. In particular, 
transgenic varieties of crops for which India is the centre of origin 
should not be released for commercial cultivation until its impact 
is adequately assessed. That there are serious concerns about 
contamination of the natural gene pool of crops originating in 
India. These are some of the potential consequences: 
i.  
Contamination of non-GM crops and their wild relatives; 
ii. 
Proliferation of weeds and creation of new weeds due to flow 
of foreign genes from GM crops to non-GM crops and their 
wild relatives; 
iii.  The likely formation of difficult-to control novel weed types 
due to transfer of foreign genes that confer hardiness; 
 iv.  Destruction of soil micro-organisms due to release of toxins 
from genes, like Bt gene, leading to adverse impact on crop 
productivity. 
 
7.15 That farm lands in India are small and closely packed 
together as agriculture is practiced in close proximity to natural 
biodiversity, often bordering forest areas or even within forest 
areas, where natural gene pools are found. A GM crop cultivated 
in one field is likely to impact other fields as well as the natural

ecosystems. No research has been undertaken to assess the 
adverse effects of such transfers. 
 
7.16  Moreover, GM crops could directly impact the economic 
prospects of a large section of the population that works in the 
agricultural sector. Small and marginal farmers are likely to be 
the most disadvantaged. Other socio-economic risks include 
market concentration, the loss of livelihood of small farmers, and 
restriction on the consumers' right to choose. 
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.260 of 2005: 
8. 
The petitioner who is a public-spirited citizen in this case 
has made the following prayers and has averred as follows in the 
context of GM Technology and GM Crops: 
“The petitioners therefore, pray that in the facts and 
circumstances of the case, this Hon’ble Court may be 
pleased to issue appropriate writs or directions to: 
A) Direct the Union of India not to allow any release of 
GMOs into the environment by way of import, 
manufacture, use or any other manner unless the 
following precautions are taken. 
(a) a protocol for all the required bio-safety tests of 
the GMOs proposed to be released is prepared by the 
GEAC after processes of public notice and public 
hearing. 
(b) The GMO has been subjected to all the required 
bio-safety tests, prepared on the basis of the 
required Biosafety tests on the basis of the above 
protocol, by agencies of independent expert bodies, 
and results of which have been made public.

B) Direct the Union of India to ban the import of any 
biological organism, food or animal feed unless they have 
been certified and labelled to be GM free, by the exporting 
country. 
C) Direct the Union of India to put in place rules to 
ensure that it shall be compulsory for any dealer or 
grower selling GMOs to label them as such. 
D) Pass such other and further orders as this Hon’ble 
Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and 
circumstances of the case.” 
 
(i) 
According to this petitioner, there are outstanding safety 
concerns 
linked 
with 
Genetically 
Engineered 
(GE) 
technology. Transgenic contamination is unavoidable and 
there can be no co-existence between GM and Non-GM 
agriculture.  
(ii) 
That research shows that Bt proteins, incorporated into 
25% of all transgenic crops worldwide, to be harmful to a 
range of non-target insects, worms and amphibians. Some 
of them are potent immunogens and allergens. In fact, 
glyphosate and the Roundup herbicide used on most 
herbicide resistant crops is shown by studies to be lethal to 
amphibians.  
(iii) That GM crops have led to an increase in pesticide use, 
financially hurting farmers and harming the environment.  
(iv) That GE technology is a fit case for the application of the 
precautionary principle which necessitates that if there are 
reasonable scientific grounds for believing that a new 
process or product may not be safe, it should not be 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 20 of 260 
 
 
 
introduced until convincing evidence of reasonable 
certainty of no harm is obtained. In addition, if the dangers 
are considered serious enough, then the principle may 
require withdrawal of GM products or impose a ban or a 
moratorium on further use thereof. 
(v) 
That safety testing for GE food is absolutely necessary for 
India before the release of any GMO into the Indian 
environment. However, there are very few established 
protocols for assessing the potential health impacts of GE 
crops. All one finds is loose guidelines that in most cases 
only list certain tests or procedures without specifying how 
they are to be conducted.  
(vi) That biotechnology companies frequently deny access or 
allow strictly conditioned access, to data on crop materials 
on the basis of confidentiality and IP concerns, making it 
very difficult for regulatory authorities and independent 
researchers to verify or review test claims on the safety of 
GE crops and foods.  
(vii) That the extant regulatory system in India is ill-equipped to 
handle challenges outlined above, as past experience also 
confirms. Circumstances surrounding the initial approvals 
of Bt cotton in India is a good example. The RCGM, under 
the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), is a body that did 
not have the jurisdiction to grant permission for the release 
of GMOs into the environment. Yet, it was originally the 
RCGM which illegally permitted the release of the GMOs 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 21 of 260 
 
 
 
into the country for the first time. It was only when there 
was a public outcry over the serious illegality of these 
clearances that attempts were made to get the release of 
GMOs cleared retrospectively. 
(viii) That even for technologies which have been tried and 
tested, and found to be far safer than GE, for instance 
Hydro-electric projects, the relevant statutes mandate a 
public notice and public hearing as well as Environmental 
Impact Assessment. Hence, it is arbitrary and unreasonable 
not to have a mandatory public notice and public hearing 
before approvals for the release of GMOs are granted.  
(ix) That as per current practice, the applicant company itself 
is asked to do testing. The test results are not available for 
public scrutiny. This is entirely without logic and is a clear 
conflict of interest involving the same biotech company that 
has a commercial interest in the approval of the GMO. 
(x) 
That in India, like many other developing countries, 
organizations which are substantially funded by the biotech 
industry have sought to influence regulatory and other 
decision-making processes by conducting "awareness" and 
"educational" programmes. The Governments of advanced 
countries too, have been a handmaiden to GE Industry, 
often arm-twisting developing countries to adopt pro-GM 
stances.

8.1  It is further averred that the CPB was adopted in 2002 and 
came into force on 11.09.2003. It is a binding International 
agreement on Biosafety and India being a signatory, is bound to 
implement its provisions. According to Article 10(6) of the 
Protocol, the lack of scientific certainty due to relevant scientific 
information and knowledge regarding the extent of potential 
adverse effects shall not prevent the contracting party from 
taking a decision, as appropriate, in order to avoid and/or 
minimize potential adverse effects. In addition, Annexure-III of 
the said protocol includes, inter alia, the general principles of risk 
assessment. It states that risk assessment should be carried out 
in a scientifically sound and transparent manner and implores 
states to take into account expert advice as well as guidelines 
developed by relevant international organizations. Further, 
Article 21(6) of the said Protocol prescribes that the information 
about the risk assessment cannot be kept confidential.  
 
8.2 That the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity 
(CBD), 1992, to which India is a party, inter alia, requires that 
the contracting parties shall domestically regulate or manage the 
risks associated with the use and release of Living Modified 
Organisms (LMOs) resulting from Biotechnology and which are 
likely to have adverse environmental impacts and risks to human 
health. It also implores states to introduce appropriate 
procedures to require impact assessment of proposed projects 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 23 of 260 
 
 
 
likely to have significant adverse effects on biodiversity and to 
allow public participation in the procedure.  
 
8.3 That in addition to implementing a moratorium on the 
release of any GMO into the domestic environment until 
adequate biosafety tests demonstrate safety beyond reasonable 
doubt, labelling for imports sourced from countries which 
produce GM crops and foods should be mandated. Therefore, 
both moratorium and labelling must be concurrent mandatory 
requirements.  
 
8.4 That farmers have the right to save seed for sowing in the 
next season, which a patent-based regime of GM seeds will 
effectively deny. This choice is a fundamental right and must be 
retained as such for better farming prospects and livelihoods. 
Therefore, the petitioner has sought the aforesaid reliefs. 
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.840 of 2016: 
8.5 The petitioner is stated to be a public-spirited citizen based 
in Chennai and is involved in a consumer movement in Tamil 
Nadu called ‘Safe Food Alliance’. The petitioner is stated to be 
one of the National Convenors of Alliance for Sustainable and 
Holistic Agriculture (ASHA), which is an organization that has 
been actively involved in the cause of the genetic modification of 
crops and its effects on human health. 
 
8.6 It is averred by the petitioner that in September 2015, the 
Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP) 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 24 of 260 
 
 
 
submitted an application to GEAC, seeking approval for the 
environmental release of GE mustard hybrid (DMH-11) seeds 
and the use of parental events, i.e., Varuna bn 3.6 and EH-2 
modbs 2.99, for development of new generation hybrids. Upon 
receipt of the application, GEAC, in its 125th meeting held on 
11.12.2015, appraised the same and decided that the CGMCP 
will be invited to give a presentation before GEAC in the 
subsequent meeting. Pursuant to the same, the CGMCP made a 
presentation before GEAC in the 126th meeting held on 
04.01.2016 and the CGMCP was directed to furnish clarifications 
with respect to some issues in para 3.3 of the Minutes of the 
Meeting. It was further decided in the meeting that a sub-
committee would be constituted under the chairmanship of Dr. 
K. Veluthambi, Co-Chair of GEAC, and the said sub-committee 
would have the duty of examining the issues raised by GEAC in 
para 3.3 and submit a report with recommendations to GEAC.  
 
8.7 On 02.02.2016, the sub-committee appointed by GEAC 
convened its first meeting and in that meeting, it voiced concerns 
over the clarifications furnished by the CGMCP on the issues 
mentioned in para 3.3. However, in the 127th meeting of GEAC 
held on 05.02.2016, GEAC adopted the recommendations of the 
sub-committee and directed the CGMCP to revise the biosafety 
dossier, in light of the comments of the sub-committee and the 
biosafety unit, and prepare an RARM document for further

review. It is stated that GEAC had decided to put the biosafety 
dossier in the public domain, but this was not carried out.  
 
8.8 In its 128th Meeting held on 04.03.2016, GEAC decided to 
await the completion of the Biosafety Support Unit's (BSU) review 
of the revised dossier before further consideration. On 
11.04.2016, the sub-committee, in its 2nd Meeting, recommended 
incorporating expert comments and remarks from the Biosafety 
Unit into its report. The report was to be presented to GEAC and 
uploaded onto its website. In its 129th Meeting on 20.06.2016, 
GEAC noted the Sub-Committee's request for an additional 
month to finalize recommendations. Subsequently, in its 130th 
Meeting, GEAC concluded that a report had been submitted by 
the 
sub-committee, 
titled 
"Assessment 
of 
Food 
and 
Environmental Safety (AFES)". It was published on GEAC's 
website for stakeholder comments within a period of 30 days. 
However, it was complained that the biosafety dossier was 
deliberately not disclosed on the website for public scrutiny.  
 
8.9 On 07.09.2016, Dr. Bhargava, a member of GEAC, made a 
startling revelation. He stated that the so-called Report of the 
sub-committee titled "Assessment of Food and Environmental 
Safety" was never shared or discussed before GEAC. Following 
this revelation, on 22.09.2016, various scholars and public 
activists endorsed an email addressed to the Hon’ble Minister of 
Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The email raised 
serious objections to the conduct of the appraisal process, 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 26 of 260 
 
 
 
particularly the refusal to disclose the biosafety dossier to the 
general public. It urged the Ministry of Environment, Forest and 
Climate Change (MoEF&CC) to extend the consultation process 
by another 120 days. In addition to the email, on 24.09.2016, 
eminent scholars and experts sent a letter to the Hon’ble Minister 
of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, expressing grave 
concerns regarding GEAC’s blatant refusal to disclose the 
biosafety data to the general public, hindering a meaningful 
exercise of public consultation. It also requested an extension of 
the consultation process for another 120 days. Despite 
objections and requests for transparency, it is stated that GEAC 
continued the consultation process, culminating in a comment 
note published on 30.09.2016, refusing to extend the 
consultation period and setting the deadline for receiving 
comments as 05.10.2016. 
 
8.10 Challenging the appraisal procedure adopted by GEAC, the 
petitioner has preferred the writ petition before this Court, under 
Article 32 of the Constitution of India, primarily contending that 
the aforesaid procedure adopted by GEAC was not only arbitrary 
but also lacked proper application of mind, rendering it illegal 
and violative of the fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 
14 and 21 of the Constitution.  
 
This assertion was underscored by instances such as the 
failure to disclose crucial information, including the biosafety 
dossier, and the opaque nature of the consultation process, 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 27 of 260 
 
 
 
which impedes meaningful public participation. Further, the 
petitioner has emphasized the statutory obligations of GEAC to 
exercise its power of granting approvals for environmental 
release of GE products in a fair, transparent, and reasonable 
manner, especially considering the lack of any procedure laid 
down under the 1989 Rules for the exercise of its powers by 
GEAC. It is stated that the potential impact of the GM crops on 
health and environment can only be known after a long gestation 
period and therefore, a stricter scrutiny ought to have been 
undertaken.  
 
8.11 Furthermore, the petitioner has criticized the sub-
committee formed by GEAC, arguing that such delegation of 
statutory functions to another body is ultra vires the 1989 Rules. 
Additionally, concerns regarding the non-disclosure of the 
biosafety dossier despite assurances and directives from 
authorities has been raised, which undermine the transparency 
and integrity of the decision-making process. 
 
8.12 The petitioner has also questioned the validity and 
adequacy of the AFES Report uploaded by GEAC, highlighting 
discrepancies in its findings, the lack of application of mind and 
the lack of comprehensive scientific scrutiny. It is averred that 
the said document was merely a 133-page summary document 
that does not explain to the public the data collected and the 
studies/tests conducted by the CGMCP. It is further pointed out 
from the AFES report that no study was conducted to examine 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 28 of 260 
 
 
 
the physiological impact of the transgene products from the 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 on the insects, no testing 
was done under the herbicide-sprayed conditions on an HT crop, 
and no testing was done on the honey quality, despite the 
questionable study of the impact on honey bees by the crop 
developers having vested interests in the subject.  
 
8.13 Moreover, the restricted access to the biosafety dossier, 
despite assurances and directives to disclose it, has also been 
criticized, since it impedes meaningful public engagement and 
violates the rights of stakeholders to be informed and participate 
effectively in the consultation process. In terms of the 
consultation process, the petitioner has contended that GEAC 
ought to have adhered to the principles of fairness and 
transparency and ought not to have made a mockery of the entire 
process of public consultation to defeat the valuable rights of the 
general public to be informed about the critical date pertaining 
to the transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 crop. It was asserted 
that the present consultation process couldn’t be completed 
without making available to the public the critical scientific data. 
Further, the petitioner avers that it was also highly arbitrary to 
expect all the interest stakeholders from all corners of the 
country to travel to New Delhi and conduct a physical 
examination of the 3000 odd pages at the premises of the 
MoEF&CC and submit meaningful inputs.

8.14 It is averred that there has also been a failure to involve 
State Governments in the process, despite agriculture being a 
state subject and mustard being a highly important crop for the 
country. 
 
8.15 Finally, the petitioner has drawn attention to the 
comparative inadequacy of the testing and consultation 
processes for genetically modified (GM) mustard, compared to 
previous cases like Bt brinjal.  
 
8.16 Overall, the petitioner has contended that the appraisal 
process 
for 
transgenic 
mustard 
hybrid 
DMH-11 
lacks 
transparency, has violated legal mandates, and fails to 
adequately consider the concerns of stakeholders, thereby 
warranting judicial intervention to ensure procedural fairness 
and safeguard public interest. 
 
Civil Appeal No.4086 of 2006: 
8.17 This appeal assails order dated 08.10.2003 passed by the 
Appellate Authority in Appeal No.2 of 2002, constituted under 
Rule 19 of the 1989 Rules notified under the EP Act, 1986.  The

(Civil) No.260 Of 2005; and, Contempt Petition (Civil) No.6 of 
2016 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.260 Of 2005: 
 
8.19 These contempt petitions have been filed alleging violation 
of orders dated 22.09.2006, 08.05.2007, 01.08.2007; and orders 
dated 15.02.2007, 08.05.2007, 08.04.2008 and 12.08.2008 
respectively passed by this Court in Writ Petition (Civil) No.260 
of 2005. 
 
Significant Orders passed by this Court in Writ Petitions: 
9. 
By order dated 01.05.2006, this Court had directed that 
until further orders, field trials of GMOs shall be conducted only 
with the approval of GEAC. Order dated 10.05.2012 referred to 
above also notes that as of the year 2007, nearly 91 varieties of 
plants, i.e., GMOs, were being subjected to open-field tests. 
However, in terms of the aforesaid order of this Court, no further 
open-field tests were permitted nor had GEAC granted any such 
approval except with the authorization of this Court. This had 
given rise to serious controversies before this Court as to, 
whether, or not, the field tests of GMOs should be banned, wholly 
or partially, in the country.  
 
9.1 This Court, feeling that it had no expertise to determine 
such an issue, which, besides being a scientific question, would 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 31 of 260 
 
 
 
have very serious and far-reaching policy consequences, by order 
dated 08.05.2007 lifted the moratorium on open-field trials, 
subject, however, to certain conditions. These included a 
directive in regard to the maintenance of 200 metres isolation 
distance while performing field tests of GMOs.  
 
9.2 A further clarification was given vide order dated 
08.04.2008, by which all concerned were directed to comply with 
the specific protocol of Level of Detection of 0.01 per cent. Since 
there was non-adherence to the said protocol and in the face of 
the report of one of the independent Experts, Dr. P.M. Bhargava, 
who was appointed to meet GEAC by the order of this Court 
dated 30.04.2009, the Government of India, on its own, imposed 
a complete ban on Bt brinjal.  
 
9.3 Later, while hearing the Additional Solicitor General for 
Union of India as well as the learned counsel for the petitioners, 
this Court found that there was a consensus on the constitution 
of an Expert Committee on certain terms of reference as 
suggested in the Minutes of the Ministry’s meeting dated 
15.03.2011 as there was a joint prayer for its constitution. 
 
9.4 In these writ petitions, vide order dated 10.05.2012, this 
Court had noted the prayers of the petitioners seeking issuance 
of directions or order to the respondent, namely the Union of 
India, inter alia, not to allow the release of GMOs into the 
environment by way of import, manufacture, use or any other 
manner. An ancillary prayer was for the prescription of a protocol

to which all the GMOs release would be subjected to. In addition, 
a direction was sought to the Union of India to frame relevant 
Rules in this regard and to ensure its implementation was 
sought.  
 
Constitution of the Technical Expert Committee (TEC): 
10. In view of the above plea, this Court, after several dates of 
hearing, vide order dated 10.05.2012 constituted a Technical

10.1 The Terms of Reference of the TEC were as follows: 
“A.  To review and recommend the nature of sequencing 
of risk assessment (environment and health safety) 
studies that need to be done for all GM crops before 
they are released into the environment.

B. To recommend the sequencing of these tests in order 
to specify the point at which environmental release 
though Open Field Trials can be permitted.  
 
C. To advise on whether a proper evaluation of the 
genetically engineered crop/plants is scientifically 
tenable in the greenhouse conditions and whether it 
is possible to replicate the conditions for testing 
under different agro ecological regions and seasons 
in greenhouse?  
 
D. To advise on whether specific conditions imposed by 
the regulatory agencies for Open Field Trials are 
adequate. If not, recommend what additional 
measures/safeguards are required to prevent 
potential risks to the environment.  
 
E. Examine the feasibility of prescribing validated 
protocols and active testing for contamination at a 
level that would preclude any escaped material from 
causing an adverse effect on the environment.  
 
F. To advise on whether institutions/laboratories in 
India have the state-of-art testing facilities and 
professional expertise to conduct various biosafety 
tests and recommend mechanisms to strengthen the 
same. If no such institutions are available in India, 
recommend setting up an independent testing 
laboratory/institution.  
 
G. The Expert Committee would be free to review 
reports or studies authored by national and 
international scientists if deemed necessary. The 
petitioners opined that they would like to formally 
propose three Expert Reports from Prof. David 
Andow, Prof. Jack Heinemann and Dr. Doug Gurian 
Sherman to be a formal part of the Committee’s 
deliberations. The MoEF may similarly nominate 
which experts they choose in this exercise.”

10.2 This Court directed the TEC to hear the Government, 
petitioners and any other intervenor, who, in the opinion of the 
TEC, could assist the cause of expeditious and accurate 
finalization of its report.  A direction was also given to the TEC to 
submit an interim report on the following issue:  
“Whether there should or should not be any ban, partial 
or otherwise, on conducting open field tests of GMOs? In 
the event open field trials are permitted, what protocol 
should be followed and conditions, if any, that may be 
imposed by the Court for implementation of open field 
trials.” 
 
 
10.3  Thereafter, an order was passed by this Court on 
09.11.2012 recording the filing of an interim report dated 
07.12.2012 and the objections filed to the said Report by the 
Union of India and others. Six weeks’ time was granted to the 
TEC to finalise and submit its final report. In the meantime, Dr. 
R.S. Paroda was appointed as a sixth member to the TEC in place 
of Prof. V.L. Chopra by order dated 09.11.2012. The TEC 
submitted its final report dated 30.06.2013. This included two 
reports, one, by the majority of five members of the TEC, and a 
separate note by Dr. R.S. Paroda.

“Recommendations  
Based on the deliberations of the TEC and 
particularly the examination/study of the safety 
dossiers, it is apparent that there are major gaps in 
the regulatory system. These need to be addressed 
before issues related to tests can be meaningfully

considered, till such time it would not be advisable 
to conduct more field trials:  
1. 
A secretariat comprising dedicated scientists 
with area expertise as well as expertise in 
biosafety needs to be established. This will 
require 
consultation 
with 
experts 
having 
experience at the international level in biosafety 
testing and evaluation of GM safety dossiers in 
reputed 
regulatory 
bodies. 
The 
TEC 
recommends doing it in collaboration with the 
Norwegian Government and GM regulatory body 
since the Norwegian system has an established 
commitment and experience in, is one of the few 
that are attuned to considering socio-economic 
issues that would be important in the Indian 
context. The regulatory body should have area-
wise 
subcommittees/expert groups in for 
example:  
 
•  
Health (human and animal)  
•  
Environment and Ecology  
•  
Agroeconomics and Socioeconomics  
•  
Molecular biology  
• 
Entomology 
•   Agricultural and Aquacultural Systems  
•    Public Health  
•  
Soil science and microbiology  
•   Plant biology  
•  
Regulatory toxicology  
•  
Plant and animal breeding and genetics 
A single committee such as the GEAC or RCGM 
doing all the valuation is not sufficient.

2. 
Conflict of interest in terms of location of the 
regulatory body needs to be addressed. The 
suggestion of the TEC is that the regulatory 
bodies to be located in the MoEF (environmental 
safety) and the MoHFW (health safety). At a 
different level, it is evident that members of the 
regulatory bodies should also be free of conflict 
of interest. 
 
3. 
Specific sites for conducting confined field trials 
need to be designated, certified, and sufficient 
mechanisms put in place for monitoring the 
trials and ensuring restricted access, disposal of 
material, associated testing and other facilities, 
These sites should be used only for field trials of 
GM crops (GM and control material). The sites 
could be in ICAR institutes or State Agricultural 
Universities 
and 
required 
conditions 
for 
isolation should be established and supported 
appropriately by ICAR. Sites in company 
premises 
may 
also 
be 
considered 
for 
certification for trials, however the land should 
be permanently owned by the applicant/tester. 
Trials should not be conducted on leased land 
so as to avoid the possibility that it may be used 
for a different purpose following the trials.  
 
4. 
Stakeholder participation, need, socio-economic 
considerations, 
societal 
impact, 
and 
sustainability should be some of the dimensions 
to be incorporated in the risk assessment and 
this should be done at an early stage in the risk 
assessment process.” 
 
10.6 The specific findings of the Report of the majority of TEC on 
the terms of reference may be discussed at this stage.  
 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 38 of 260 
 
 
 
 
(i) Firstly, as to the nature of sequencing of risk assessment 
studies that need to be done for GM crops before they are 
released into the environment, the majority recommended 
the following:  
a. 
The majority recommended consultation, ideally prior to 
the development of the GM product intended for field 
trials, wherein the applicant would provide information 
to the regulator about the product, its purpose 
(including whether it is intended for research only or 
commercialization), and how it is to be deployed in India. 
At this stage, the scope of issues that needs to be 
addressed relating to health and environmental safety 
can be discussed and defined on a case-wise basis 
keeping in mind the overall phases of risk assessment: 
hazard identification; hazard characterization; exposure 
assessment; risk characterization; and mitigation 
options. Need, socio-economic factors and sustainability 
should also be considered and thoroughly discussed at 
this stage. If a GMO is initially declared for research and 
at 
a 
later 
stage 
it 
is 
to 
be 
considered 
for 
commercialization then that would be treated as a fresh 
application. The overall process of risk assessment 
should follow the Flowchart for the Risk Assessment 
Process in the Guidance on Risk Assessment of LMIOs 
(UNEP/CBD/BS/COP 
MOP/6/13/Add.1) 
of 
the 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 39 of 260 
 
 
 
Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB). In the case of 
health safety, the regulator should expect a suitable 
response to all relevant paragraphs of the Codex 
Alimentarius Commission (CAC) Guideline for the 
Conduct of Food Safety Assessment of Foods Derived 
from Recombinant DNA (rDNA) Plants (CAC/GL 45-
2003) and any other chosen risk assessment procedure. 
In doing so the regulator establishes a minimum 
expectation of the risk assessment meeting international 
requirements. It was pointed out that both the CPB and 
CAC guidelines provide guidance with regard to 
principles and issues that are to be addressed. They 
leave open the details of specific tests to be carried out 
which is left to the national system and the regulator.  
b. The majority, thus, noted the need to include chronic 
and transgenerational toxicity testing in feeding studies 
of rodents based on the fact that food is consumed over 
the entire lifetime and that nutritional stress can also 
lead to adverse or unintended effects over long-term 
exposure. The sensitive stages of reproduction also need 
to be included.  
c. 
In addition, the majority emphasized that the regulatory 
process should be open to new scientific information 
that may have a bearing on the risk assessment, if 
necessary, even after deregulation of an event.  

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 40 of 260 
 
 
 
d. The majority also emphasised that the applicant should 
be responsible for providing to the regulator, all 
information that has a bearing on the risk assessment, 
regardless of whether it was obtained for the purpose of 
the risk assessment. In cases where the applicant is a 
collaborator/partner/ subsidiary in the development of 
the GMO, the applicant should provide this information 
along with the consent of all parties.  
e. 
With regard to the nature of tests for Bt in food crops, 
the majority was of the view that the safety of Bt 
transgenics with regard to chronic toxicity has not been 
established and this needs to be done before it can be 
considered safe. In this regard, it was pointed out that 
by far, the largest deployment of transgenics worldwide 
is in soyabean, corn, cotton, and canola, all of which are 
used primarily for oil or feed after processing. Nowhere 
are Bt transgenics being widely consumed in large 
amounts for any major food crop, that is, directly used 
for human consumption. The majority could not find any 
compelling reason for India to be the first to do so. It, 
therefore recommended that there should be a 
moratorium on field trials for Bt in food crops (those that 
are directly used for food) intended for commercialization 
(not research) until there is more definitive information 
from sufficient number of studies as to the long-term 
safety of Bt in food crops.

f. 
The majority also examined issues in relation to 
Herbicide Tolerant (HT) crops. The conclusion here was 
that HT crops would most likely exert a highly adverse 
impact over time on sustainable agriculture, rural 
livelihoods, and environment. The majority, therefore, 
found them completely unsuitable in the Indian context.  
g. 
The majority also highlighted how crops in their centres 
of origin and diversity often have a deep cultural 
significance 
that 
can 
get 
lost 
when 
utilitarian 
considerations predominate the discourse. Ceremonial 
and medicinal varieties can also be put at risk from GM 
crops by reduction of diversity and genetic purity. For 
example, in the case of brinjal, the Malapur variety in 
Karnataka is an essential accompaniment at temple 
festivals and religious ceremonies. Likewise, Oryza 
nivara, a medicinal rice, can also be at risk if GM rice 
comes to dominate the crop as has happened for 
example, in the case of cotton, in India.  
h. The release of a GM crop into its area of origin or 
diversity has far greater ramifications and potential for 
negative impact than for other species. To justify this, 
the majority suggested a requirement of extraordinarily 
compelling reasons. GM crops that offer incremental 
advantages or solutions to specific and limited problems 
were not to be deemed sufficient reasons to justify such 
release. Not finding any such compelling reasons under 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 42 of 260 
 
 
 
the present conditions, it recommended that release of 
GM crops for which India is a centre of origin or diversity 
should not be allowed at all.  
(ii) Secondly, as for, when environmental release through open-
field trials should be permitted, the majority recommended 
that the sequence of testing should be carried out in order of 
increasing environmental exposure required to perform the 
test. Tests should be done under the minimum conditions of 
exposure required for the test. In other words, the testing 
should proceed in a progressive manner that increases 
confidence with regard to safety. While not covering all 
possible tests for all crops, it laid down certain minimum 
tests possible to carry out under contained conditions within 
the laboratory of greenhouse, before the GMO is taken out of 
containment. These include tests based on bioinformatics 
such as possible allergenicity and toxicity; acute toxicity of 
the purified protein; in-vitro digestibility and any other 
biochemical tests on the purified protein. Where appropriate 
and necessary, tests such as those for general growth 
characteristics and plant habit as part of event selections 
may be performed under confined conditions in consultation 
with the regulator. Those tests on the plant that can be 
performed under contained conditions as judged by the 
regulator on a case-wise basis should be performed under 
contained conditions.

(iii) Thirdly, as for whether a proper evaluation of the GE plant 
is scientifically tenable in greenhouse conditions and 
whether it is possible to replicate the conditions for testing 
under different agro-ecological regions and seasons in 
greenhouse, the majority noted that it cannot be said that it 
is generally possible to replicate the conditions for testing 
under different agro-ecological regions and conditions in the 
greenhouse.  
(iv) Fourthly, the majority noted the need to develop specific sites 
for conducting field trials. It also emphasised the need for 
sufficient mechanisms for monitoring the trials and ensuring 
restricted access, disposal of material, associated testing and 
other facilities. These sites were recommended to be used 
only for field trials of GM crops (GM and control material). 
The sites could be in Indian Council of Agricultural Research 
(ICAR) Institutes or State Agricultural Universities and 
required conditions for isolation should be established and 
supported appropriately by ICAR. Sites in company premises 
may also be considered for certification for trials, however 
the 
land 
should 
be 
permanently 
owned 
by 
the 
applicant/tester. Trials should not be conducted on leased 
land so as to avoid the possibility that it may be used for a 
different purpose following the trials.  
(v) Fifthly, on the feasibility of prescribing validated protocols 
and active testing for contamination with the view to 
preclude any escaped material from causing an adverse 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 44 of 260 
 
 
 
effect on the environment, the majority noted that the tests 
for detecting contamination at the stipulated level (0.01 %) 
are possible and have been demonstrated in some of the 
dossiers. However, it was emphasized that these in 
themselves do not preclude material from escaping. There 
are several ways in which contamination can occur and it 
probably will not be possible to deploy the tests at a level that 
will preclude the possibility of escape. Even in the most 
careful of conditions, contamination can occur. There are 
well-known examples of contamination having occurred as 
well.  
(vi) Finally, on whether institutions and laboratories in India 
have the state-of-art testing facilities and professional 
expertise to conduct various biosafety tests, the majority 
noted that the professional expertise and standards across 
the institutions appeared unsatisfactory. However, it noted 
that it is ultimately the expertise available in the regulatory 
system that sets the standards for conducting and 
evaluating the biosafety tests. Unless this expertise and 
capacity is present, no amount of facility creation will be able 
to address the issues. Based on the examination of the safety 
dossiers the majority found that at present, the regulatory 
system has major gaps and these will require rethinking, 
investment, and re-learning to fix. A deeper understanding 
of the process of Risk Assessment is needed within the 
regulatory system for it to meet the needs of a proper 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 45 of 260 
 
 
 
biosafety evaluation. This is not available in the country as 
per the majority. It, therefore, recommended that the 
requisite understanding be developed through consultation, 
collaboration, and capacity building. It is of critical 
importance that the Indian regulatory system develops the 
ability to assess how any GM product is likely to impact 
different sections of society. 
 
10.7 Dr. R.S. Paroda submitted a separate dissenting report. A 
brief discussion of the Report may be adverted to.  
(i) 
Firstly, as for the nature of sequencing of risk assessment 
studies that need to be done for GM crops before they are 
released into the environment, Dr. Paroda, in his dissenting 
report recommended the following:  
a. 
The sequencing of studies provided in the 
"Guidance for Information/Data Generation 
and Documentation for Safety Assessment of 
Regulated, Genetically Engineered (GE) Plants", 
which is in draft stage, should henceforth be 
adopted quickly by the RCGM and GEAC. 
b. 
The 
sequencing 
of 
studies 
presented 
in 
"Guidance for Information Generation and 
Documentation 
for 
Safety 
Assessment 
of 
Regulated, Genetically Engineered (GE) Plants" 
should, in future, be reviewed at regular 
intervals of no less than three years to ensure 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 46 of 260 
 
 
 
that these guidelines remain consistent with 
internationally accepted best practices and 
standards. 
c. 
Guidelines for the conduct of confined field 
trials and for GM food safety assessment that 
meet the international norms have currently 
been adopted by RCGM and GEAC. However, it 
was noted that the present approach for the 
environmental risk assessment (ERA) in the 
guidelines for research in transgenic plants was 
rather broad, whereas there is an urgent need 
for developing and adopting comprehensive 
guidelines for the ERA by RCGM and GEAC. The 
process for the same should be transparent and 
consultative, involving all stakeholders and it 
must start immediately.  
d. 
A Risk Assessment Unit (RAU), as also 
suggested in the "Draft Establishment Plan for 
the 
National 
Biotechnology 
Regulatory 
Authority" should be established. Further, the 
RAU should serve both RCGM and GEAC and be 
permanently staffed by a multi-disciplinary 
team of scientists/experts competent enough 
and responsible for undertaking science-based 
risk assessments, including but not limited to 
those required to approve clinical or confined 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 47 of 260 
 
 
 
field trials for the experimental GMOs as well as 
for their commercial release of GMOs (i.e., 
product 
specific 
risk 
assessments). 
The 
proposed RAU could be transitioned to the 
Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India 
(BRAI), as and when the BRAI Bill is 
promulgated by the Parliament.  
e. 
In addition to establishing the RAU, RCGM and 
GEAC should immediately establish a roster of 
qualified 
scientific 
experts 
in 
relevant 
disciplines 
to 
provide 
sound 
scientific 
advice/information on biosafety issues that 
could impact on human and animal health as 
well as the environment. The issue concerning 
conflict of interest should also be addressed 
while including experienced scientists to the 
roster.  
f. 
Although, the safety assessment is completed 
after GEAC approval and subsequently the GM 
crops are to be treated in the same manner as 
their non-GM counterparts for the purpose of 
variety/hybrid release and registration, seed 
multiplication and cultivation; as a measure to 
ensure quality products for the farmers, the 
National Agricultural Research System (NARS) 
should have an assigned responsibility for the

conduct of confined field trials for assessing the 
agronomic 
performance, 
an 
essential 
requirement for the release of GM varieties/ 
hybrids in accordance with the National Seed 
Policy as well as National Seed Act. For this, 
ICAR Delhi can make good use of established 
infrastructure 
under 
the 
All 
India 
Crop 
Coordinated Programmes. It is advised that a 
single window system for managing the testing 
and release of GM varieties and hybrids should 
be established taking into account special 
considerations involved with GM crops viz. 
expression 
levels 
of 
inserted 
proteins, 
confirmation of the events etc., irrespective of 
whether these are produced by the private or 
public sector. In this context, the Ministry of 
Agriculture (MoA) should consider establishing 
a high-level committee of experts: including 
socio-economists, tanners, Non-Governmental 
Organisations (NGOs) and the representative of 
the private sector to review finally, for 
commercial release, the cases that are cleared 
by GEAC. 
g. 
Once a GM variety hybrid is released, a post-
release monitoring mechanism must be put in 
place. 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 49 of 260 
 
 
 
(ii) Secondly, as to when environmental release through open-
field trials should be permitted, the dissenting report noted 
that “open-field trial" is a misnomer in the context of trials of 
GM crops. This is because even though the trial is done in 
the open field, the GM plants and genetic material being 
tested are confined to the field trial site using measures to 
ensure that the “genes in pollen or seed do not escape from 
the trial site”. Thus, the right term is “Confined Field Trials”. 
It, then proceeded to suggest that Confined Field Trials 
should only be permitted by RCGM and GEAC after careful 
consideration of submissions that adhere exactly to the 
"Application for Confined Field Trial" form. This form, in 
combination with the "Guidelines and Standard Operating 
Procedures 
for 
Confined 
Field 
Trials 
of 
Regulated, 
Genetically 
Engineered 
Plants", 
clearly 
specifies 
the 
information required by the competent authorities to 
determine if a Confined Field Trial should be permitted or 
not. The application form was developed through a 
transparent, consultative process that included a period for 
public review and comment. Hence, both the approach and 
procedure for permitting Confined Field Trials in India have 
already been peer-reviewed and public-reviewed. In sum, the 
tests that are required prior to obtaining a permit for a 
confined field trial are:

a. 
Amino acid sequence homology comparisons to 
assess the extent to which the transgenic 
protein is similar in structure to known toxins; 
b. 
Amino acid sequence homology comparisons to 
assess the extent to which the transgenic 
protein is similar in structure to known 
allergens.  
It was also considered desirable, but not mandatory, to 
determine the maximum level of expression of the transgenic 
protein in the edible portions of the plant. 
(iii) Thirdly, as to whether a proper evaluation of the GE plant is 
scientifically tenable in the greenhouse conditions, the 
dissenting report answered in the negative. It noted that a 
proper evaluation of a GE plant is scientifically not tenable 
in a contained greenhouse since it would not be feasible to 
replicate the conditions prevailing under natural field 
conditions representing different agro-ecological regions and 
growing seasons. Therefore, it was advised that confined field 
testing, as recommended under the present regulatory 
system, is the right option for a realistic evaluation of any 
GE plant to know its suitability for any agronomic trait of 
economic importance.  
(iv) Fourthly, whether specific conditions imposed by the 
regulatory agencies for open-field trials (or “Confined Field 
Tests”, as Dr. Paroda prefers) are adequate, the dissenting

report expressed concerns about the existing system in India 
and recommended, among other things, the following:  
a. 
The RCGM, GEAC and ICAR must work hand in 
hand to conduct the confined field trials at the 
specified sites as well as improve the quality and 
timeliness 
of 
inspections 
by 
qualified 
monitoring teams. A roster of such monitors, 
with required expertise needs to be maintained 
and updated regularly by these agencies.  
b. 
Crop-specific Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOP) should be developed and made available 
online. Such SOPs should incorporate, in 
addition to the existing procedures, i) methods 
for reproductive isolation of the confined field 
trial site, ii) schedules for monitoring the field 
trial during and after the growing season, iii) 
required duration of post-harvest restrictions on 
the trial site, and iv) methods for on-site/off-site 
disposal of regulated plant materials. 
c. 
A system for notification of confined field trial 
sites located in different agro-ecological zones 
should be developed by RCGM and GEAC in 
consultation with the ICAR. These sites could 
include 
both 
public 
and 
private 
sector 
institutions/facilities, meeting the specified 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 52 of 260 
 
 
 
conditions. However, no trials should be allowed 
on farmers' fields, leased or otherwise. 
d. 
Integrate the existing system of testing and 
standard protocols under All India Coordinated 
Research Project (AICRP) with the three years of 
confined field testing in Biosafety Research 
Level (BRL)-I and BRL-II. The agronomic 
evaluation should be against the best national 
check, regional check, and the latest released 
variety or hybrid in the state concerned. For all 
the new events, the decision of RCGM and 
GEAC on biosafety and environmental concerns 
must be final at either of the testing stages 
(BRL-I or BRL-II), irrespective of good agronomic 
performance of the variety.  
e. 
Monitoring for biosafety compliance as well as 
agronomic performance of each confined field 
trial must be made mandatory, and should be 
carried out by GEAC through an inter-
ministerial monitoring compliance committee 
including people drawn from a roster of experts. 
In addition, each confined field trial must be 
monitored 
by 
a 
site-specific 
monitoring 
committee.

f. 
In cases where an already approved event is 
incorporated into a new genetic background, 
after being verified for its stability, such variety 
or hybrid shall be evaluated independently by 
the AICRP protocol for agronomic performance 
and the expression of the event concerned for a 
period of two years, as per the existing practice 
under the New Seed Policy. 
g. 
Varieties or hybrids evaluated by the above 
process shall then be approved for general 
cultivation by a Central GM-Crop Release 
Committee at par with the Variety Release 
Committee under the MoA. This committee shall 
include experts from the disciplines concerned 
including the Crop Project Coordinators or 
Director, officials of Seed or Crops Divisions of 
DAC and ICAR, socio-economists, progressive 
farmers, 
NGOs 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
representatives.  
h. Once a GM crop variety/hybrid is released, a 
well-designed 
case-by-case 
post-release 
monitoring system must be put in place jointly 
by 
the 
Department 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
Cooperation (DoAC) and ICAR to address 
specific post-release issues identified during the 
event approval by GEAC. Such a system should

also monitor the long term effects from the point 
of view of food safety, soil health, environment 
and agronomic performance. 
i. 
Finally, the MoA may also consider issuing a 
separate notification on priority for the general 
release of GM crops at par with New Seeds 
Policy, while legally ensuring much needed 
harmonization of both EPA under Ministry of 
Environment and Forests (MoEF) and the Seed 
Act under MoA.  
 
10.8 A corrigendum was issued to the final report of TEC on 
12.07.2013. Paragraph 6 of the Majority Report is modified by 
the corrigendum, which reads as under: 
“6. page 71, lines 3-5: “… exert a highly adverse impact 
over time on sustainable agriculture, rural livelihoods, 
and environment. The TEC finds them completely 
unsuitable in the Indian context.”  
Corrected: “… exert a highly adverse impact on 
sustainable 
agriculture,

field trials and release of HT crops not be allowed in 
India.”  
 
Parliamentary Standing Committee (PSC) on Agriculture’s 
Report on “Cultivation of Genetically Modified Food Crops – 
Prospects and Effects” – 2012: 
 
11.  The aforesaid Report, submitted on 09.08.2012, has been 
relied upon by the learned counsel Sri Prashant Bhushan. The 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 55 of 260 
 
 
 
salient 
observations 
and 
recommendations 
of 
the 
said 
Committee are encapsulated in the following paragraphs: 
 
i. To ascertain the efficacy of the extant system in general and 
the role of GEAC as the apex regulator in particular, the 
Committee sought the views of Dr. P.M. Bhargava, founder 
Director of CCMB, Hyderabad and then the Supreme Court 
nominee on GEAC. The gist of the testimony of Dr. P.M. 
Bhargava given on 22.12.2010 can be crystallised in the 
following points: 
a. 
All the tests on Bt cotton have either been 
conducted by the concerned applicant for 
approval, or by an accredited laboratory on the 
samples given by the applicant. The Bt cotton 
was tested and approved surreptitiously without 
adequate information being available to the 
public. 
b. 
The Bt brinjal was approved on the basis of an 
expert committee report, which lacked in 
scientific quality, credibility, consistency and 
rigour. Relying upon a private conversation with 
the then Co-Chairman of GEAC, Prof. Arjula 
Reddy, Dr. Bhargava claimed that the former 
was under pressure to approve Bt brinjal and to 
give a go by to the chronic toxicity and other 
tests which had been proposed by the latter. He 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 56 of 260 
 
 
 
also claimed that the Co-Chairman confided in 
him that even the tests undertaken were 
performed badly. 
c. 
That no chronic toxic studies have been 
conducted on GM crops.  
d. 
Despite a specific proposal for establishing a lab 
to 
conduct 
indigenous 
and 
independent 
assessment studies, the erstwhile Director 
General of ICAR, Dr. R.S. Paroda, the erstwhile 
Director General of Council of Scientific and 
Industrial Research (CSIR), Dr. R.A. Mashelkar 
and GEAC were reluctant to support the same. 
ii. The Committee, discussing the status, composition and 
functioning of GEAC, highlighted the following deficiencies: 
a. 
GEAC is headed by a civil servant, who is also 
functioning in another capacity in the MoEF, 
the controlling authority of GEAC.  
 
b. 
The Co-Chairman of GEAC is a biotechnologist 
who, though purportedly from outside, is 
nominated by the DBT, the Department that 
funds and promotes projects on transgenic 
products. Therefore, primacy is accorded to the 
DBT nominated Co-Chair in the decision-
making process. 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 57 of 260 
 
 
 
c. 
The Vice-Chairman is again a civil servant, 
simultaneously 
discharging 
a 
few 
more 
responsibilities in another role in the MoEF.  
d. 
GEAC being an entity created under the Rules 
rather than an Act of Parliament deprives it of 
the status, powers and more importantly, 
autonomy and independence that a statutory 
regulator ought to have.  
iii. The Committee noted the findings of several scientific 
reports, 
including 
the 
International 
Assessment 
of 
Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for 
Development 
(IAASTD) 
Report 
– 
‘Agriculture 
at 
a 
Crossroads’, and underlined the following shortcomings of 
modern biotechnology in agriculture:  
a. 
Modern biotechnologies have yet to prove their 
efficacy, safety and sustainability in the case of 
GM crops. There are significant limitations in its 
ability to conserve the resilience of small and 
subsistence agricultural systems, etc.  
b. 
Containment of harm would be a very 
challenging task even for some of the most well-
equipped developed countries and simply 
impossible in a country like India.  
c. 
The integration of biotechnology must be within 
an enabling environment, supported by local 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 58 of 260 
 
 
 
research and education that empowers local 
communities.  
iv. With respect to regulation and labelling of GM foodstuffs, the 
Committee observed the casual approach on the part of both 
MoEF and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). 
While the MoEF, on 23.08.2007, exempted all GM food 
categories from regulations under Rule 11 if the end product 
was not an LMO, the MoHFW did not include GM foods from 
the restrictions on manufacture, distribution and selling 
when it issued the notification under Section 22, Food Safety 
and Standards Act, 2006 (for short, “FSSA, 2006”). The 
Committee noted that the Food Safety and Standards 
Authority of India (FSSAI) regulation for GM processed food 
was nowhere in sight, even though so many years had gone 
by. While noting that Section 23 of FSSA, 2006 requires 
FSSAI to notify labelling, the Committee observed that FSSAI 
had not been able to do so.  
v. It was concluded that the tendency of the regulatory 
mechanism, in the absence of specialized infrastructure and 
research and development (R&D) facilities in India, is to base 
their decision-making on practices and studies elsewhere, as 
also on the assessments and data generated by the applicant 
concerned. This was particularly concerning in light of the 
testimony of Dr. Bhargava, as the contents of his testimony 
were “not merely slippages due to oversight or human error 
but indicative of collusion of the worst kind”. By its very 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 59 of 260 
 
 
 
composition, GEAC does not have regular existence and 
meets monthly only when some decisions are to be taken. It 
is also a sad reality that modern biotechnology being a 
nascent discipline in the Country, we have a serious dearth 
of scientists of eminence in sufficient numbers, therefore, 
more or less the same set of people sit on both the sides, i.e., 
to develop technologies and products, as also to assess, 
evaluate and approve them. 
vi. The Committee noted that Article 246 of the Constitution of 
India, read with Entry 14, List II, assigns “agriculture, 
including agricultural education and research, protection 
against pest and prevention of plant diseases” to the States. 
However, it observed that for a thing as crucial as field trials, 
the State Governments were not even consulted till recently.  
vii. The Committee concluded that in a regulatory set-up where 
the promoter has an overwhelming say and presence in the 
regulatory mechanism, an element of subjectivity in 
assessment and evaluation is unavoidable. The entire 
system, therefore, reflects a pro-DBT/pro-industry tilt which 
is best avoided. Apart from this major shortcoming, the 
Committee’s examination has revealed that the extant 
system is grossly inadequate and antiquated to face the 
typical challenges a population-intensive, agrarian economy 
(primarily) like India poses when the question of introduction 
of such modern technologies in the agriculture sector crops 
up.

Parliamentary Standing Committee (PSC) on Science and 
Technology, 
Environment and 
Forests’ Report 
titled 
“Genetically 
Modified 
Crops 
and 
its 
impact 
on 
Environment” - 2017: 
 
12. The aforesaid Report has been perused by us. The salient 
observations and recommendations of the said Committee are 
encapsulated in the following paragraphs: 
i. 
The Committee considered the legal and administrative 
architecture for the regulation of biotechnology and GE 
techniques 
and 
the 
extant 
process 
of 
health 
and 
environmental safety assessment.  
ii. 
It observed that as a party to several International 
Conventions, India should ensure the safe usage of GM crops 
through the “Precautionary Approach”. In line with the 
same, India ratified International Protocols like the CBD, the 
CPB and the Nagoya Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol 
on Liability and Redress (NKSPLR).  
iii. 
The Committee took note of the divergent views on the 
efficacy of the existing regulatory mechanism. It expressed 
certain apprehensions about the stance of the MoEF&CC 
that the existing regulatory regime left no scope for any non-
adherence. It also observed that the MoEF&CC and GEAC’s 
casual 
approach 
indicated 
indifference 
towards 
the 
environmental safety and health hazards of humans and 
animals. Specifically, it concluded that the regulatory 
agencies had turned a blind eye to the negative impact of GM 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 61 of 260 
 
 
 
crops on the environment. It was observed that the existing 
regulatory mechanism was susceptible to manipulation, due 
to the following processual infirmities and substantive 
deficiencies: 
a. 
The whole process of regulation depends upon 
the data made available to the regulators by the 
technology developers.  
b. 
None of the Committees established under the 
1989 Rules conduct the closed field trials on 
their own but are solely dependent on the data 
provided to them by the technology developer.  
c. 
There was a scope for the technology developers 
to manipulate the data to suit their own 
requirements.  
d. 
The Government failed to put in place the 
desired protocols as late as 2011, while the GM 
crops were introduced in 2002.  
e. 
Two of the top three positions of GEAC are held 
by the bureaucrats of the MoEF&CC. There is a 
conflict of interest in the appointment of some 
of the members of GEAC. 
f. 
The members of GEAC were mostly from the 
Government and Government-aided institutions 
and there was hardly any representation of the 
civil society or the State Governments on the 
Board. 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 62 of 260 
 
 
 
g. 
Even though the DLCs are provided for in the 
1989 Rules, the importance of this Committee 
had 
not 
been 
realised, 
thereby 
further 
weakening the confidence level of farmers, civil 
societies, environmentalists, etc. 
h. There was lack of clarity on the impact of the 
adoption of Bt cotton on crop yield. Therefore, 
the Committee was not persuaded about the 
claims of success of Bt cotton as India’s cotton 
yields increased by 69% in the five years (2000-
2005) when Bt cotton was less than 6% of total 
cotton area, but by only 10% in the ten years 
from 2005 to 2015 when Bt cotton grew to 94% 
of the total cotton area. There was also lack of 
clarity on whether traditional methods of 
farming could achieve better outcomes. 
i. 
It also expressed its apprehensions about the 
stated benefit of reduced dependence on 
chemical pesticides. Based on consultations 
with members of civil society, it observed that 
after the advent of Bt cotton, the insecticide use 
on bollworm, both sucking and secondary pests 
took over the ecological niche vacated by the 
bollworm. Therefore, the per hectare insecticide 
use had almost doubled. The issue of pesticide 
resistivity was also a matter of concern, as it was 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 63 of 260 
 
 
 
observed that the pink bollworm had developed 
resistance to Bt cotton variety, i.e., Bollgard-II 
(BG-II). 
j. 
Since transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11is a 
HT GMO, there exists clear evidence of the 
adverse impacts thereof from elsewhere in the 
world.  In the case of transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11, thus, there are serious unanswered 
questions. 
k. 
The cultivation of GM crops in the midst of other 
indigenous farming would cause unstoppable 
contamination and cross-pollination. It would 
also adversely affect non-target organisms like 
soil microbes, insects, bees, butterflies, birds or 
even mammals which are critical to the agro-
ecosystem. 
l. 
There is a glaring lack of indigenous study on 
the impact of GM crops on human health. It is 
particularly worrying because certain studies on 
animals 
revealed 
complications 
including 
infertility, immune problems, accelerated aging, 
insulin regulation, and changes in major 
organs. The Department of Health Research has 
accorded its approval for commercial release 
without scrutinising any indigenous study. Only 
acute and sub-chronic studies have been 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 64 of 260 
 
 
 
conducted but chronic and transgenerational 
studies have not been conducted, therefore, 
risking the health of future generations. 
 
13.  As is well-settled, the Parliamentary Select Committees are 
entities through which Parliament scrutinises the policies and 
actions of the Government and enforces executive accountability. 
Select Committees are constituted with specifically nominated 
Members of Parliament and exercise the authority delegated by 
the House. The role of Select Committees has been outlined in 
Erskine May's Treatise on The Law, Privileges, Proceedings and 
Usage of Parliament, (Lexis Nexis, 24th Edn. 2011, p.37.] as 
under: 
“Select Committees are appointed by the House to 
perform a wide range of functions on the House's behalf. 
Most notably they have become over recent years the 
principal mechanism by which the House discharges its 
responsibilities for the scrutiny of government policy and 
actions. Increasingly this scrutiny work has become the 
most widely recognised and public means by which 
Parliament holds Government Ministers and their 
departments to account.” 
 
13.1 Parliamentary material, such as the reports submitted by 
Select Committees, is an aid to the construction of legislation, as 
such material may disclose the legislative intention lying behind 
the ambiguous words and expressions, vide Pepper (Inspector 
of Taxes) vs. Hart, 1992 UKHL 3 (HL) (“Pepper”). Noting the 
evolution of Indian law, Justice G.P. Singh, in Principles of 
Statutory Interpretation (14th Edn.), has stated that this Court 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 65 of 260 
 
 
 
has pressed the parliamentary materials as an aid in resolving 
questions of construction. This Court has clarified that courts 
may seek recourse to background parliamentary material, 
including a statement of position by the Government, to 
understand the reasons of the enactment of a law and the 
problems sought to be remedied vide Kalpana Mehta vs. Union 
of India, (2018) 7 SCC 1 (“Kalpana Mehta”). 
 
13.2 The pertinent facts in Kalpana Mehta were that a writ 
petitioner, who had challenged the grant of approval to an HPV 
(Human Papilloma Virus) vaccine by the Drugs Controller 
General of India, had invited the attention of this Court to a 
report of the PSC and this Court had directed the Government to 
file an affidavit about the status of compliance with the contents 
of the report. At that stage, the State and private respondents 
raised doubts about the appropriateness of adverting to a report 
of the PSC while exercising jurisdiction under Article 32 in a 
public interest litigation. Therefore, the core question raised 
therein that came to be referred to the Constitution Bench was 
whether a PSC report can be placed reliance upon for 
adjudication of a fact in issue and also for what other purposes 
it can be taken aid of.

13.3 It was concluded that the reports of the Parliamentary 
Committee can be relied upon to adduce the position adopted by 
the Government. In this respect, reliance can be placed upon the 
responses given by the Government to the queries raised by the 
Parliamentary Committee. The Union of India has filed Action 
Taken Reports with respect to the recommendations made by the 
Standing Committee.  
 
Conditional 
approval 
by 
Government 
of 
India 
for 
Environmental Release of DMH-11: 
 
14. We shall now proceed to the actual controversy. According 
to Union of India, the conditional approval for environmental 
release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 and parental lines 
bn 3.6 and modbs 2.99 containing barnase, barstar and bar 
genes has been made after following the detailed procedure in law 
and after considering the biosafety data accumulated over several 
years. Also, the conditional approval has been made in 
accordance with the guidelines and framework which enable a 
consistent and rigorous risk-analysis approach to evaluating 
applications for the environmental release of GE plants is the 
contention of the Union of India. 
 
14.1 That in the instant case, after recommendation of RCGM, 
GEAC had considered the recommendations of RCGM in the 
following meetings in regard to confined field trials:

14.2 After confined field trials, the facts leading to conditional 
approval for grant of environmental release by GEAC are as 
under: 
(i) 
The CGMCP, University of Delhi, New Delhi, on 15.09.2015, 
submitted an application for approval of environmental 
release of the GE mustard (Brassica juncea) hybrid DMH-11 
and use of parental events (Varuna bn 3.6 and EH-2 
modbs2.99) for development of new generation of hybrids, 
along with a dossier of 3285 pages as a compilation of the 
results of the food and environmental safety studies that 
were carried out at the time of research/experiments/ 
confined field trials and the application for the environmental 
release of transgenic mustard DMH-11 hybrid and parental 
lines bn 3.6 and modbs 2.99 containing barnase, barstar and 
bar genes to GEAC.  
(ii) The said application for environmental release was 
considered in the 125th meeting of GEAC held on 11.12.2015, 
wherein GEAC deliberated on the application submitted by 
CGMCP for environmental release of mustard. After a 
detailed deliberation, it was decided that the applicant may 
be invited to give a presentation to GEAC on 04.01.2016. 
(iii) In its 126th meeting held on 04.01.2016, GEAC constituted a 
sub-committee 
under 
the 
Chairmanship 
of 
Dr. 
K. 
Veluthambi, Co-Chair of GEAC, with the following members 
for examination of the dossier: 
 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 70 of 260

(iv) Pursuant to the recommendation of the above-mentioned 
meeting, GEAC was informed in its 127th meeting held on 
05.02.2016, that the 1st meeting of the sub-committee was 
held on 02.02.2016. The Chair of the sub-committee also 
informed GEAC that the outcome of the review of the 
biosafety dossier submitted by the BSU set-up by DBT was 
also deliberated in detail. It was further informed that the 
sub-committee recommended revision of the biosafety 
dossier 
by 
incorporating 
additional 
information/ 
clarifications/gaps identified by the sub-committee and the 
BSU. Considering the above, GEAC, in its 127th meeting, 
adopted the recommendations of the sub-committee and 
directed for the revision of biosafety dossier. GEAC also 
discussed the procedure for further review and consultation

on the biosafety data in respect of transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11 developed by CGMCP and Biosafety RARM report to 
be prepared for consideration of GEAC. It was also decided 
that if the biosafety dossier is found to be complete in all 
respects, the biosafety dossier/RARM report, excluding 
confidential information, will be put in the public domain for 
comments. Thereafter, a detailed response to the comments 
received would be prepared and considered before a final 
decision is taken by GEAC. 
(v) The first meeting of the sub-committee was held on 
02.02.2016 and the second meeting of the sub-committee 
was held on 11.04.2016. 
 
Sub-committee meetings: 
14.2.1 
In 
the 
first 
sub-committee 
meeting, 
held 
on 
02.02.2016, the sub-committee made the following submissions: 
a) 
That the mandate given to it included review of the biosafety 
dossier for its adequacy and accuracy in all respects, and 
indicate gaps, if any. 
b) 
That Dr. S.R. Rao Advisor, DBT informed that the biosafety 
dossier had been examined in detail by the BSU set up in 
DBT and points for further clarification and dossier revision 
had been prepared for consideration and discussion. 
c) 
That on the application submitted by the applicant CGMCP, 
University of Delhi, South Campus, for environmental 
release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 and parental 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 72 of 260 
 
 
 
lines containing events bn 3.6 and modbs 2.99 developed 
using barnase, barstar and bar genes, was taken up. 
d) 
That discussion was held with the applicant and the sub-
committee advised for continuous monitoring and further 
investigation for fitness and the transfer of transgenic trait 
from DMH-11 to their progenies and feral populations that 
will be essential for implementing management strategies to 
minimize persistence and dissemination from release site. 
The sub-committee also advised that a suitable post-release 
management strategy should be implemented. 
e) 
That certain data had to be incorporated in the revised 
dossier, along with the details of oil content and other 
measured parameters in the revised dossier. 
f) 
That the data suggested that the activities of barnase need 
to be presented quantitatively and UDSC-barnase specific 
activity can be compared with any other over expressed 
barnase specific activity to compare activity status of the 
proteins. 
g) 
That the updated statistics data from National Institute of 
Nutrition (NIN) may be included in the revised dossier. 
h) That Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) for Barnase promoter 
has not been registered in India. 
i) 
Requested the University to check whether DMH-11 hybrid 
accumulated complexes of barnase + barstar. 
j) 
Questioned whether grazing of transgenic mustard by farm 
animals would affect them.

k) 
That the bar gene is present in the two parental varieties and 
continues to be present in the hybrid but release of marker 
free hybrid would have been desirable. For that, reply by the 
applicant was that barnase/barstar technology requires a 
herbicide gene for hybrid seed production and for 
maintaining the male sterile line.  
l) 
That the regulatory guidelines provide an overall list of 
principles for conducting biosafety studies and therefore, 
case specific issues need to be addressed by the applicant. 
m) That sub-chronic toxicity was evaluated in rats, though it 
would have been much more relevant to do so in rabbits, 
goats and other cattle which are likely to consume mustard 
leaves. 
n) That issues regarding deliberate introduction of a protein 
that induces cell death into our food were raised/discussed. 
o) 
That in the case of canola, only oil is consumed, but mustard 
leaves and seeds are consumed as food by humans and this 
is a matter of concern. To this, the reply of the applicant was 
as under: 
“It is a fact that a fear-psychosis has been created 
around transgenic crops. Transgenic technologies 
are 
heavily 
patented 
and 
mainly 
with 
transnationals-many fear that dependence on 
proprietary 
technologies 
may 
jeopardize 
food 
security of developing countries like India. Although 
European continent is scientifically very advanced – 
they seem to have opted for chemical control rather 
than biological control. Europe is a huge importer of 
food and has no ambition of increasing food

production. They are only interested in high-value 
agriculture. Europe has not released even any 
cisgenic event. Japan gave biosafety clearance for 
environmental release of barnase/barstar Canola in 
1996 – but has chosen not to grow it. However, 
Japan is the largest importer of Canola seed, oil and 
meal. Decisions on not growing GM crops are 
political and economic in nature – rather than 
related to biosafety.” 
 
p) 
That 
long-term 
post-release 
monitoring 
should 
be 
implemented to study (i) weediness, (ii) pollen flow to wild 
relatives, (iii) the impact on beneficial insects, and (iv) the 
impact on beneficial soil microbes, if any. 
 
14.2.2 
The second sub-committee meeting of GEAC was held 
on 11.04.2016. In the said meeting, Dr. S.R. Rao briefed the sub-
committee members on the follow up actions taken by BSU 
pursuant to the 128th GEAC meeting held on 04.03.2016 
regarding the application for environmental release of transgenic 
mustard (Brassica juncea) hybrid DMH-11 by the CGMCP, 
University of Delhi (South Campus). The sub-committee was 
made aware of the fact that the 128th GEAC meeting held on 
04.03.2016, had sought further information/clarifications from 
CGMCP and accordingly, a revised document was submitted by 
the applicant. Accordingly, the revised biosafety dossier and draft 
RARM report of the sub-committee was circulated amongst the 
sub-committee members and comments of the experts were 
tabulated along with remarks of the BSU.

14.2.3  
Observation of one of the members of the sub-
committee was regarding the sustainable use of deregulated GE 
mustard in future and as to how honey derived from GE mustard 
be tested for the absence of barnase for a definite period as a part 
of post-release monitoring. 
 
14.2.4  
The sub-committee opined that one of the members of 
the sub-committee explained that self-reproducible populations 
of mustard (Brassica juncea) may get established in the hills (not 
in the plains) and though probability of such occurrence may be 
low, this question needs to be addressed. The sub-committee 
opined that this should be taken as a scientific question, which 
should be addressed from a research angle in the interest of long-
term sustainability of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 
technology. 
 
14.2.5  
The sub-committee sought time to analyse and review 
the revised dossier and results obtained in the 129th GEAC 
meeting, which was held on 20.06.2016.  
 
14.2.6  
In the meantime, GEAC invited two groups of NGOs 
for presenting their views/concerns regarding release of 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 in India.  
 
14.2.7  
The sub-committee constituted by GEAC suggested a 
report being placed on the MoEF&CC website for thirty days, to 
invite comments from stakeholders in the 130th GEAC meeting 
held on 11.08.2016.

14.2.8  
Accordingly, the AFES Report was uploaded on the 
website of MoEF&CC, inviting comments from all stakeholders. 
The comments received were to be reviewed by the sub-
committee and GEAC prior to taking an appropriate decision. 
The full biosafety dossier submitted by the applicant was 
available in GEAC Secretariat and any person interested in 
studying the same could access the dossier during working 
hours in person, by prior appointment during the public 
consultation period, at Indira Paryavaran Bhawan, Jorbagh, New 
Delhi – 110 003, till the closing of working hours, i.e., 05:30 PM 
on 05.10.2016. A total of 759 comments were received between 
05.09.2016 and 05.10.2016. 
 
14.2.9  
It is also to be noted that about 29 persons (including 
from places other than Delhi) personally inspected the dossier at 
the premises of the MoEF&CC and provided their comments. It 
is stated that thereafter, all these comments were analyzed and 
deliberated by the sub-committee of GEAC. 
 
14.2.10 
The instant proposal was again considered on 
11.05.2017 in the 133rd GEAC meeting, wherein the report 
submitted by the sub-committee was examined in detail and 
GEAC recommended the proposal with certain terms and 
conditions for further approval by the Competent Authority. But 
pursuant to receipt of various representations from different 
stakeholders, matters related to environmental release of 
transgenic mustard were kept pending for further review.

14.2.11 
In the 134th meeting of GEAC held on 21.03.2018, it 
was recorded that the instant proposal was referred back to 
GEAC for its re-examination, pursuant to receipt of several 
representations, both in support and against, after the 133rd 
meeting of GEAC held on 11.05.2017. In this meeting, GEAC 
examined all the representations and reiterated that these 
representations were already deliberated extensively while taking 
the decision in the 133rd meeting of GEAC. After a detailed 
discussion, GEAC agreed that the applicant may be advised to 
undertake field demonstration on transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11 in an area of five acres at two to three different locations, 
with a view to generate additional data on honey bees and other 
pollinators and on soil microbial diversity. 
 
14.2.12 
The instant matter was re-examined in the 136th 
meeting of GEAC held on 20.09.2018, wherein the said 
Committee 
accorded 
permission 
for 
conduct 
of 
field 
demonstration studies on honey bees and other pollinators at two 
locations of up to five acres in each location namely Punjab 
Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana and Indian Agricultural 
Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi. 
 
14.2.13 
Thereafter, in the 137th meeting of GEAC held on 
20.03.2019, the Committee noted the response from the 
applicant regarding the reasons for deferment of field 
demonstration studies on transgenic mustard during the season 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 78 of 260 
 
 
 
2018-19 and the deferment was further extended for the seasons 
2019-20 and 2020-21. 
 
14.2.14 
At this stage, Prof. Deepak Pental, Former Professor of 
Genetics and Vice-Chancellor, University of Delhi, on behalf of 
CGMCP, University of Delhi, South Campus, New Delhi, made a 
representation on 10.05.2022 to the Hon’ble Minister for 
Environment, Forest and Climate Change, to accept the 
recommendations for environmental release of transgenic 
mustard hybrid DMH-11 made in 133rd GEAC meeting. 
Accordingly, comments were sought from the concerned 
Department, namely DBT and Department of Agricultural 
Research and Education (DARE). Some of the relevant comments 
related to the present matter are reproduced herein below: 
“The comments received from DARE: “GEAC may 
consider exempting additional studies on the impact of 
GM Mustard hybrid DMH-11 containing the bar, 
barnase, and barstar genes on honey bees and other 
pollinators as decided in its 136th meeting and the 
recommendation of the 133rd meeting of GEAC may be 
considered. The environmental release of the proposed 
events will broaden the scope for developing many high 
yielding mustard hybrids in future. 
The comments received from DBT: Based on the 
scientific evidence and the available data from various 
international agencies, it seems likely that there were no 
major deviations in the behavior of honey bees when 
compared among the transgenic and non-transgenic 
comparator lines; and suggested that GEAC may 
consider its recommendations of the 133rd meeting on 
the environmental release of GE mustard.”

Soon thereafter, ICAR by its letter dated 30.07.2022 wrote 
to MoEF&CC for GEAC to consider the recommendation for 
environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 
made in its 133rd GEAC meeting. DBT, by its letter dated 
01.08.2022, also wrote to MoEF&CC for GEAC to consider the 
recommendation for environmental release of transgenic 
mustard hybrid DMH-11 made in its 133rd GEAC meeting, in 
light of the biosafety data received from the applicant as well as 
reviewing the international evidence of safety of the concerned 
technology. 
 
14.2.15 
Thereafter, on 25.08.2022, at the 146th GEAC meeting, 
the applicant made a detailed presentation on all aspects of the 
proposal for environmental release of DMH-11. In this meeting of 
GEAC, it was recommended that an Expert Committee be 
constituted to examine the request letter dated 10.05.2022, with 
respect to availability of adequate evidence about impact of 
transgenic mustard on honey bees and other pollinators, in order 
to assess the need for conducting field demonstration studies on 
honey bees and other pollinators. The composition of this Expert 
Committee was as follows:

14.2.16 
First and second meeting of this Expert Committee 
were convened on 23.09.2022 and 30.09.2022 respectively. The 
recommendations of the Expert Committee constituted in 146th 
meeting were submitted to GEAC and were as under: 
“Based on the examination of scientific evidences 
available globally, and as per the recommendations of 
concerned ministries, it seems unlikely that the bar, 
barnase, and barstar system will pose an adverse impact 
on honey bees and other pollinators. Therefore, the 
Committee was of the view that GEAC may consider the 
environmental release of GE mustard and further 
evaluation to be carried out as per ICAR guidelines for 
release and notification. 
However, to generate scientific evidences in Indian agro-
climatic 
situation 
and 
also 
as 
a 
precautionary 
mechanism, the Expert Committee suggests that the 
field demonstration studies with respect to the effect of 
GE mustard on honey bees and other pollinators, as 
recommended in the 136th GEAC meeting, may also be 
conducted post-environmental release, simultaneously

by the applicant, within two years under supervision of 
ICAR and the report be submitted to the GEAC.” 
 
14.2.17 
Based on the comments of the DARE and the DBT, and 
recommendations of the sub-committee, GEAC, in its 147th 
meeting held on 18.10.2022, recommended environmental 
release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11, which was 
accepted by the Central Government on 25.10.2022. 
 
14.3   
It is clear from a bare perusal of the abovementioned 
events that the Union of India has taken the decision on the 
environmental release on the basis of the aforesaid procedure 
which was followed by GEAC. That the conditional permission 
granted by Union of India to the CGMCP for environmental 
release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 is said to be for 
the following purposes: 
a. 
The environmental release of GE mustard parental 
lines bn 3.6 carrying barnase and bar genes and 
modbs 2.99 containing barstar and bar genes, is to 
use the developing new parental lines and hybrids 
under supervision of ICAR. The environmental 
release of mustard hybrid DMH-11 for its seed 
production and testing, as per existing ICAR 
guidelines and other extant rules/regulations, is 
prior to commercial release. 
 
b. 
Further, to generate scientific evidences in Indian 
agro-climatic situation and also as a precautionary 
mechanism, the field demonstration studies with 
respect to the effect of GE mustard on honey bees 
and other pollinators, as recommended in the 136th 
GEAC meeting, shall also be conducted post-
environmental 
release 
simultaneously 
by 
the

applicant, within two years, under the supervision 
of ICAR, as per ICAR guidelines and other extant 
rules/guidelines/regulations and the report be 
submitted to GEAC. 
 
 
14.4      The environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11 hybrid DMH-11 for its seed production and testing as 
per ICAR guidelines was recommended by GEAC in its 147th 
meeting. The seed production and testing was to require three 
crop seasons, unless otherwise decided by ICAR, before the seeds 
are commercially available to the farmers. 
 
14.5      It is further pertinent to note that the permission for 
environmental release was to be subjected to terms and 
conditions to ensure environmental safeguards, for example: 
(i)  It provides that during the period of approval, a 
Post-Release Monitoring Committee (PRMC) would 
be constituted by GEAC, consisting of two subject 
matter external experts and a nominee each from 
the RCGM, GEAC and the PRMC, who will visit the 
growing sites of the approved biological material(s) 
at least once during each season and submit their 
report to GEAC on the matters of compliance. 
  
(ii) Usage of any formulation or herbicide is not 
permitted for cultivation in the farmer’s field under 
any situation and such use would require necessary 
permission as per the procedures and protocols for 
safety assessment of insecticides/herbicides by the 
Central Insecticide Board & Registration Committee 
(CIB&RC). Any such use in the farmer's field without 
due approval from the CIB&RC would attract 
appropriate legal action under the Insecticides Act, 
1968 and the Rules, 1971, made under the said Act

and the EP Act, 1986, and the Rules made 
thereunder. 
 
(iii)  The production of seeds of transgenic mustard 
hybrid 
DMH-11 
will 
take 
place 
under 
the 
supervision of ICAR, as per the existing ICAR 
guidelines and other extant rules/regulations, after 
which the commercial cultivation of mustard will 
start. Commercial use will be subject to the Seeds 
Act, 1966 and the related rules and regulations. 
 
(iv) As a precautionary mechanism, the data in regard 
to the impact of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 
on honey bees and other pollinators will be 
generated during these two years under the 
supervision of ICAR. This may help create additional 
data in regard to the impact of transgenic mustard 
hybrid 
DMH-11 
on 
honey 
bees 
and 
other 
pollinators. 
 
(v)  The approval may be revoked under Rule 13(2) of the 
1989 Rules, if any evidences regarding harmful 
effects of the approved GE mustard, such as damage 
to the environment, nature or health as could not be 
envisaged when the approval was given, come under 
notice of GEAC and on non-compliance of any 
condition stipulated by GEAC. 
 
14.6     Within two months, on 18.10.2022, at the 147th GEAC 
meeting, it was recommended that environmental release of 
DMH-11 be approved subject to some conditions and safeguards. 
The recommendations and the conditions were communicated by 
the MoEF&CC to the applicant-Prof. Deepak Pental on 
25.10.2022 and the same are extracted as under:

I.A. No.209550 of 2023 has been filed in Writ Petition (Civil) 
No.115 of 2004 by the petitioner therein, seeking a direction to 
the respondent Union of India to destroy the planted material of 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 in view of the undertaking 
given to this Court and there being violations of the same.   
The aforesaid prayer made by the petitioner has also to be 
considered in light of the prayer made by the Union of India, 
which has also filed an application (I.A. No.167110 of 2023), 
seeking discharge from the oral statement made before this 
Court on 08.11.2022 to the effect that no precipitative steps for 
environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 
would be taken. 
 
Additional Affidavit of Union of India: 
16. It would be useful to refer to the additional affidavit dated 
09.11.2022 filed by the Union of India through Scientist ‘G’ in 
the MoEF&CC, New Delhi.  
 
16.1 That on 03.11.2022, it was brought to the notice of this 
Court that permission of environmental release of transgenic 
mustard hybrid DMH-11 had been granted by the Government 
of India to the CGMCP at the University of Delhi on 25.10.2022. 
Pursuant to the said order, the Union of India has sought to place 
on record the decision-making process employed by the 
Government of India and the regulatory framework under which 
this permission was granted.

16.2 In addition to the above, the Union of India has stated in its 
Additional Affidavit dated 09.11.2022 that the research, 
development, and use of GE technologies is a highly technical 
matter guided by the views of subject experts. As such, the 
inquiry before this court is limited to whether there exists an 
adequate regulatory mechanism governing this field and whether 
material compliance with the same has been made.  
 
16.3 The conditional approval for environmental release of 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 and its parental lines 
Varuna bn 3.6 and EH-2 modbs 2.99 containing barnase, barstar, 
and bar genes prior to commercial release has been made after a 
long and exhaustive regulatory process which commenced as far 
back as in 2010 and is outlined as below:  
i. 
The initial R&D was conducted by the CGMCP in 
accordance with the Revised Guidelines for Research in 
Transgenic Plants, 1998 in the laboratory as well as 
greenhouse conditions. The R&D was regulated by the 
Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC) and RCGM as 
prescribed by the Guidelines.  
ii. 
Based on the information generated, an application was 
made to the IBSC for permission to conduct a confined field 
trial. After the recommendation of the IBSC, the CGMCP 
submitted a further application to RCGM. After the 
recommendation of the RCGM, GEAC considered the 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 91 of 260 
 
 
 
recommendation of the RCGM in its meetings dated 
29.09.2010, 21.09.2011, and 18.07.2014. 
iii. 
After the completion of confined field tests, the CGMCP 
submitted an application dated 15.09.2015, along with a 
dossier of 3285 pages, seeking approval for environmental 
release of the GE mustard hybrid DMH-11 and its parental 
lines Varuna bn 3.6 and EH-2 modbs 2.99.  
iv. 
The said application was considered by GEAC in its 125th 
meeting dated 11.12.2015. After a detailed discussion, the 
applicant was invited to give a presentation to GEAC on 
04.01.2016. Accordingly, on 04.01.2016, GEAC formed an 
eight-member sub-committee under the chairmanship of 
Dr. K. Veluthambi, Co-chair, GEAC. 
v. 
The meeting of the sub-committee took place on 02.02.2016 
and the sub-committee recommended revision of the 
biosafety dossier by the applicant. Considering the above, 
GEAC, in its 127th meeting dated 05.02.2016, adopted the 
recommendations of the sub-committee and directed the 
revision of the dossier. In addition, GEAC directed 
preparation of the Biosafety RARM Report. 
vi. 
The sub-committee requested GEAC for an additional one 
month’s time to submit its final recommendations. The 
request was granted by GEAC in its 129th meeting dated 
20.06.2016. GEAC also invited two groups of NGOs to 
present their views on the release of transgenic mustard 
hybrid DMH-11 in India. 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 92 of 260 
 
 
 
vii. 
Thereafter, on 11.08.2016, GEAC considered the report 
titled “Assessment of Food and Environmental Safety”, 
incorporating the evaluation of biosafety data generated by 
the applicant CGMCP and prepared by the sub-committee 
along with the inputs of RAU of the RCGM. The report was 
then placed on MoEF&CC website for a period of 30 days, 
from 05.09.2016 to 05.10.2016, for inviting comments.  
viii. 
A total of 759 comments were received on the AFES Report 
and the sub-committee proceeded to analyse the same.  
ix. 
In the 133rd meeting of GEAC dated 11.05.2017, the report 
submitted by the sub-committee was examined in detail. In 
the 134th meeting of GEAC dated 21.03.2018, the proposal 
was referred back to GEAC for re-examination. GEAC also 
advised the applicant to undertake field demonstration on 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 in an area of five acres 
at two-three different locations, with a view to generate 
additional data on honey bees and other pollinators and on 
soil microbial diversity.  
x. 
The proposal came up for re-examination by GEAC in its 
136th meeting dated 20.09.2018, wherein GEAC accorded 
permission for conducting field demonstration studies at 
two locations of up to five acres each in PAU, Ludhiana and 
IARI, New Delhi.  
xi. 
In the 137th meeting of GEAC dated 20.03.2019, GEAC 
deferred field demonstration studies to the seasons 2019-
20 and 2020-21.

xii. 
Thereafter, 
Prof. 
Deepak 
Pental, 
vide 
letter 
dated 
10.05.2022 
requested 
the 
MoEF&CC 
to 
okay 
the 
environmental release of GE mustard.  
xiii. 
GEAC sought comments from the DBT and the DARE. Both 
opined that GEAC may consider exempting additional field 
demonstration studies.  
xiv. 
In the 146th meeting of GEAC held on 25.08.2022, GEAC 
recommended that a nine-member expert committee be 
constituted to examine the request letter dated 10.05.2022 
with respect to availability of adequate evidence about the 
impact of transgenic mustard on honey bees and other 
pollinators in order to assess the need for conducting field 
demonstration studies.  
xv. 
The abovesaid sub-committee met on 23.09.2022 and 
30.09.2022 and submitted recommendations to GEAC, 
stating that the field demonstration studies may be 
conducted even after the environmental release of GE 
mustard.  
xvi. 
Finally, GEAC, in its 147th meeting held on 18.10.2022, 
recommended environmental release of transgenic mustard 
hybrid DMH-11, which came to be accepted by the Central 
Government on 25.10.2022.  
 
16.4 It is further averred that the production of seeds of 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 would take place under the 
supervision of ICAR, as per existing guidelines and other extant 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 94 of 260 
 
 
 
rules and regulations. As a precautionary measure, the data with 
regard to the impact of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 on 
honey bees and other pollinators is to be generated during these 
two years of supervision by ICAR and approval could be revoked 
under Rule 13 (2) of the 1989 Rules, if any harmful effects are 
found. In addition, during the period of approval, a PRMC would 
visit the growing sites at least once during each season and 
submit its report to GEAC. Only after this elaborate process 
would the commercial cultivation of transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11 start. Commercial cultivation, too, shall be subject to 
the Seeds Act, 1966 and the rules and regulations made 
thereunder.  
 
16.5 Finally, emphasizing the importance of mustard as a 
prominent edible oil and seed meal crop of India, the economic 
need to increase its domestic yield was highlighted. It was also 
submitted that internationally, the United States of America 
(USA), Canada, and Australia have allowed cultivation of GE 
rapeseed containing the bar, barnase, and barstar genes. 
Parental lines and hybrids were also released for cultivation in 
Canada (1996), the USA (2002), and Australia (2003). In all three 
countries, yields of rapeseed increased with the introduction of 
GM hybrids. Therefore, if employed, the DMH-11 hybrid 
technology would contribute to increase in the domestic yield of 
mustard in India.

Submissions: 
17. Elaborate submissions have been advanced by the learned 
senior counsel, Sri Sanjay Parekh and learned counsel, Sri 
Prashant Bhushan for the petitioners as well as learned Senior 
Counsel Sri Pais and other learned Counsel for other petitioners 
and intervenors. Learned Attorney General and the learned 
Solicitor General have appeared for the respondents. A summary 
of the submissions is set out hereinbelow. 
 
Submissions of the petitioners: 
17.1 Sri Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel has made the 
following submissions:  
The decision dated 18.10.2022 of GEAC to approve 
environmental 
and 
commercial 
release 
of 
DMH-11/GM 
mustard/ HT mustard is violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the 
Constitution as it suffers from non-application of mind and is, 
therefore, arbitrary and unreasonable. Elaborating on the same, 
it was contended that the said decision would lead to irreversible 
contamination of the environment and threaten biodiversity.  The 
decision was also said to violate the choice of consumers to 
consume non-GM food and that of farmers to grow non-GM crops 
in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution. In this regard, the 
following points were highlighted: 
a. 
It is an admitted fact that DMH-11 is an HT crop (vide para 
16 page 12 of the Additional Affidavit of Union of India). 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 96 of 260 
 
 
 
b. The TEC appointed by this Court, in its detailed report, 
recommended a complete ban on all HT crops. 
c. 
It is an admitted fact that DMH-11 has no yield advantage 
over non-GM/HT mustard hybrids/varieties. 
d. The sole advantage for environmental release of DMH-11 is 
that it is robust at cross pollination and there are absolutely 
no immediate advantages to the environmental release of 
DMH-11, rather there are attendant risks that come with the 
environment release of HT crops and it is only a hope that 
the same could be used to produce new hybrids with better 
yield in future.  If that is the hope, then the new hybrids with 
better yield could be developed in hybrid conditions and not 
be released into the environment, as there would be no 
rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by the 
release. 
e. 
Condition Nos. VI and VII of the order or decision dated 
18.10.2022 directed that the farmers may not lawfully spray 
herbicide/glufosinate on DMH-11, thereby ensuring that 
there can be no lawful beneficial effect therefrom in terms of 
weed management from HT crops to farmers. 
f. 
If there is no real yield advantage, DMH-11 cannot be 
marketed to the farmers as having yield advantage, as this 
would be misleading for supporting its environmental and 
commercial release.  
g. 
In the 134th meeting of GEAC, the applicant of DMH-11 was 
advised to conduct research on the effect thereof on honey

bees.  The said advisory was given a go by and the study was 
directed to be done after environmental release of DMH-11.  
It is submitted that the DBT has funded the development of 
DMH-11 and therefore, its recommendation to forego studies 
on honey bees is a case of conflict of interest and ignores all 
precautionary principles.   
h. That even though there is no immediate advantage from the 
environmental release of DMH-11, the immediate and 
irreversible disadvantage from its release is the scientific 
certainty of contamination of non-GM/non-HT mustard 
hybrids/varieties through cross pollination from bees, 
thereby: 
− 
irreversibly threatening biodiversity, as eventually all 
non-GM/non-HT mustard will be contaminated; 
− 
irreversibly eliminating choice of consumers to eat non-
GM/non-HT mustard, in the absence of any mechanism 
to prevent pollination by bees, which is accentuated by 
the absence of any laws for labelling; 
− 
irreversibly coercing farmers who do not wish to grow 
GM crops to be susceptible to their crops being 
contaminated with transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 
with no legal mechanism for redress or liability for losses 
suffered; 
− 
irreversibly causing loss to organic farmers and the 
entire agro-economic system relying on non-GM crops 
as their products can no longer be certified as GM-free. 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 98 of 260 
 
 
 
For instance, honey, which is produced in the country 
from mustard flowers, can no longer be certified as 
organic or GM-free in the absence of elaborate testing for 
each and every product.  Hence, there is a need for 
studies with regard to long-term effects on biosafety and 
the hazards from environmental release of DMH-11. 
i. 
The present writ petition has been filed seeking to put in 
place a comprehensive, stringent, scientifically rigorous and 
transparent biosafety test protocol in the public domain for 
GMOs before they may be released into the environment.  
This is because GMOs are a serious potential hazard and 
several dimensions of biosafety are necessary before their 
release into the environment. The proper and independent 
testing of GMOs is essential in view of the concern of the 
irreversible contamination of non-GMOs crops and the 
environment at large. This is unlike a drug, which when 
tested to be unsafe, can be recalled.  It is contended that the 
GMO contamination of the environment would affect the 
nation’s foundational seed stock and change the structure of 
the food at the molecular level without recourse.  
j. 
The right to health being a fundamental right, it is necessary 
that the Union Government and the Regulators put in place 
a rigorous mechanism so as to avoid the harm caused by 
GMOs, such as chronic toxicity and other unattended effects 
including health hazards.  Therefore, the precautionary 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 99 of 260 
 
 
 
principles must be purposefully applied to insulate from the 
scientific uncertainty about hazardous GMOs in future.  
 
17.2 On the decision of GEAC to approve HT mustard/GM 
mustard/DMH-11 for environmental and commercial release, 
learned counsel contended that GEAC in its 147th meeting 
decided to permit environmental release/commercial cultivation 
of HT mustard. Based on the recommendation of the Expert 
Committee as well as the comments received from DBT and 
DARE, the Committee recommended the following:  
“VI.  Usage of any formulation of herbicide is 
recommended only under controlled and specified 
conditions exclusively for hybrid seed production after 
obtaining label claim and approval from Central 
Insecticide Board & Registration Committee (CIB&RC). 
VII. 
Usage of any formulation of herbicide is not 
permitted for cultivation in the farmer’s field under any 
situation and such use would require the necessary 
permission as per the procedures and protocols of safety 
assessment of insecticides/herbides by CIB&RC.  Any 
such use in the farmer’s field without due approval from 
CIB&RC would attract appropriate legal action under 
Central Insecticides Act 1968 and Rules 1971, EP Act 
1986 and the Rules made thereunder.” 
 
17.3 It is learnt by the petitioners that HT transgenic mustard 
hybrid DMH-11 seed was sown for seed selection in Kanpur and 
Bharatpur at the Directorate of Rapeseed and Mustard Research 
(DRMR).  The 301st report of the Department related PSC on 
Science and Technology, Environment & Forests, titled 
“Genetically Modified Crops and its impact on Environment” 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 100 of 260 
 
 
 
(2017) (“301st Report of PSC”, for the sake of convenience) noted 
that the Government put on hold the earlier approval given by 
GEAC to DMH-11 (vide Page 26 of the 301st PSC report/Pg.672, 
Compilation). This is because in undertaking seed selection, it 
would be necessary to spray illegal glufosinate on the seedlings, 
for it is only seedlings which have been successfully engineered 
for resistance to the herbicide which could be selected for seed 
production.  The concomitant advisory to farmers not to spray 
would then go meaningless, as the farmers would definitely spray 
for the short-term gain to kill weeds. In this regard, it is 
mentioned that planting of HT – Bt cotton and Bt brinjal and 
other such crops on commercial scale have gone on despite illegal 
effects of the same.  
 
17.4 It was also submitted that the National Bureau of Plant 
Genetic Resources (NBPGR) had stated that India has rich 
biodiversity in mustard. The Indian Gene Banks have 5477 
Brassica juncea (“Indian mustard”) accessions, which would all 
be at the risk of contamination. 
 
17.5 On the recommendations of the TEC as regards HT/GM 
crops, it was submitted that HT crops being a potent carcinogen 
may lead to breast cancer. Therefore, the TEC recommended a 
complete ban on HT crops.   
 
17.6 It was next contended that the first crop given de facto 
approval by GEAC was Bt cotton, followed by Bt brinjal, in 
respect of which there was a moratorium vide order dated 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 101 of 260 
 
 
 
09.02.2010 of the Ministry of Science, Environment & Forests.  
In the case of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 (HT crop), the 
technical dossier running into thousands of pages was made 
available for 30 days at the headquarters of GEAC in New Delhi 
for physical inspection. This was contrary to the earlier process, 
wherein biosafety dossier as regards Bt cotton and Bt brinjal was 
put in the public domain on the website of GEAC upon being 
directed by this Court and whereupon on critical examination of 
the same by national and international experts, the approval 
given by GEAC had to be put on hold by the Ministry, as it 
became apparent that GEAC had not complied with the 
regulatory mechanism and the biosafety and ERA of Bt brinjal 
was totally lacking.  
 
17.7 Learned counsel also brought to our notice the following 
three reports which have discussed in detail the issue of GM 
crops: 
a. 
Thirty-Seventh (37th) report of PSC on Agriculture (2011-
2012) titled “Cultivation of Genetically Modified Food Crops 
– Prospects and Effects” (hereinafter referred to as the “37th 
Report of PSC”). 
b. Final Report of the five original members of the TEC 
submitted to this Court on 30.06.2013. 
c. 
Three Hundred and First (301st) report of the Department 
related PSC on Science and Technology, Environment & 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 102 of 260 
 
 
 
Forests, titled, “Genetically Modified Crops and its impact on 
Environment” (2017). 
 
17.8 The deposition of Dr. P.M. Bhargava, Molecular Biologist, 
Founder Director, CCMB, Hyderabad, appointed as an 
independent expert on GEAC by this Court vide order dated 
13.02.2008, as recorded in the 37th report of PSC, was also read 
out to us. Similarly, the observations and recommendations of 
the TEC as regards GEAC being the regulator have been read out 
to us during the course of the submissions. We shall refer to the 
relevant portions of these reports a little later. 
 
17.9 It was next contended that although the ubiquitous 
glyphosate has been used for over four decades as the safest 
herbicide, glufosinate is acknowledged as more toxic than 
glyphosate as it kills indiscriminately soil organisms, beneficial 
insects etc.   It was also submitted that neurotoxin can cause 
birth defects and damage to most plants that it comes into 
contact with.  It is banned in Europe and not permitted in India 
under the Insecticides Act, 1968 for mustard.  It is an 
organophosphorus compound (toxic to biology) very similar in 
structure to glyphosate and as weeds become more resistant, 
they will eventually be resistant to all known herbicides.  
 
17.10 
It was lastly submitted that the DBT, Ministry of 
Science & Technology is an active partner and funder in this 
venture of HT DMH-11. The DBT directly oversees the regulation 
of GMOs including HT mustard and houses the Regulators and 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 103 of 260 
 
 
 
the RCGM. The conflict of interest in GMO Regulators and 
relevant Ministry has not been recognised as unconscionable 
and an ethical breach of public trust doctrine. Attention was 
drawn to the fact that Prof. Pental himself had been involved in 
the regulatory oversight of Bt brinjal and there is a tied-in 
relationship that obscures the line of separation that must be 
rigorously maintained between the Regulators and the regulated, 
if stringent norms of GMO risk assessment and biosafety are to 
be maintained for this hazardous technology. There cannot be a 
partnership between the Regulator and the Developer which is 
invested in the HT mustard GMOs. Therefore, the submission 
was that the environmental release of DMH-11/GM mustard/HT 
mustard needs to be halted in line with the precautionary 
principle. 
 
17.11 
Learned senior counsel Sri Sanjay Parikh contended 
that one of the reliefs sought for in the writ petition is for the 
formulation of a National Policy on GM by a High-Powered 
Committee till a sound regulatory and monitoring system is put 
in place and till then there should be a moratorium on release of 
GM. Although, the Union of India in its counter affidavit, filed in 
November, 2004, attempted to justify the 1989 Rules, till date, 
there is no National Policy on GM food and “Inter-Ministerial 
Task Force” under the Chairmanship of Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, 
which has submitted a final report, is still under consideration. 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 104 of 260 
 
 
 
It was contended that in the absence of a National Policy, the 
regulatory system, at present, continues to be deficient. 
 
17.12 
It was also contended that while transgenic mustard 
hybrid DMH-11 is an HT crop, the Government of India has 
proceeded on the basis that it is not an HT crop. The question of 
the consequences, if transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 is 
indeed an HT crop, remains unanswered. The Union of India in 
its additional affidavit dated 09.11.2022 has acknowledged that 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 possesses HT through the 
inherited bar gene from both parents, making it fully HT. Yet, the 
Government asserts that it cannot be officially labelled as such, 
and therefore, it should not be referred to as a HT crop.  
 
17.13 
The crucial inquiry remains regarding the impact of 
herbicide spraying on a transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 field 
— whether the crop will exhibit herbicide tolerance or succumb 
to the herbicide. The definition of an HT crop hinges on the 
introduction of a new trait, in this case, HT via the bar genes in 
the mustard plant. This trait specifically confers tolerance to the 
herbicide glufosinate ammonium, as also acknowledged in the 
approval letter number F.No.C-12013/35/2010-CSIII dated 
25.10.2022. That despite GEAC imposing conditions and 
warning against unauthorized herbicide use, initiating legal 
action against farmers is impractical, given that farmers may use 
herbicides believing that DMH-11 is an HT crop. Consequently, 
the Government is unable to pursue legal action based on this 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 105 of 260 
 
 
 
misunderstanding amongst farmers. In the case of HT-Bt cotton, 
extensively grown nationwide since 2017 along with the 
unauthorized herbicide glyphosate, the Government has failed to 
undertake any legal or corrective measures against entities 
endorsing and facilitating its cultivation. The cultivation of Bt 
cotton has led to the development of resistance to the Bt toxin, 
giving rise to robust secondary pests. This, in turn, has resulted 
in an increased application of pesticides, contradicting the initial 
purpose of Bt cotton. Consequently, it is doubtful that control 
over herbicide use and the penalization of farmers employing 
herbicides will be effective in the case of DMH-11. It was further 
contended that the potential adverse impacts of using HT crops 
along with their matching herbicides have to be understood and 
are enumerated as under: 
a. 
Herbicide use destroys all the vegetation in and around the 
fields where the HT crop is cultivated, which is used by the 
rural community in significant ways. 
b. In India, the biodiversity found in and around fields is not 
considered “weeds” and therefore, not useless, as they are in 
the west. These plants, so called “weeds”, provide: 
i. 
leafy green vegetables and many kinds of saag like 
chaulai and bathua that provide valuable nutrition for 
free to poor rural families; 
ii. 
they also provide green fodder for rural livestock; 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 106 of 260 
 
 
 
iii. 
such “weeds” are also medicinal plants that traditional 
healers such as vaids and hakeems use in the 
treatment of human and animal diseases. 
c. 
Introduction of the HT trait will destroy the opportunity to 
do mixed farming which is prevalent in Indian agriculture. 
d. The HT trait will also strike against any efforts to promote 
organic agriculture, since it involves heavy chemical use of 
herbicides. 
e. 
The use of herbicides and their accumulation in the soil will 
damage soil health and the chemicals will enter the food 
chain to the detriment of human health. 
 
17.14 
It was also contended that GM has never been tested 
as an HT crop, despite having HT properties and in fact, India 
does not have any regulatory guidelines and protocols for testing 
of HT crops. Reliance has been placed on the TEC Report and 
our attention was drawn to various portions thereof, which we 
shall consider later. Similarly, reference was made to the 301st 
Report of the PSC. 
 
17.15 
Sri Parikh also submitted that the manner in which 
the conditional clearance was granted makes apparent the 
loopholes in the regulatory system. In this regard, it was 
submitted that on 21.03.2018, a decision was taken by GEAC in 
its 134th meeting to generate additional data on honey bees and 
other pollinators on soil microbial diversity. The same was given 
a go by subsequently after receipt of a letter from Prof. Deepak 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 107 of 260 
 
 
 
Pental dated 10.05.2022 and contrary to precautionary 
principles, it was decided by GEAC in its 147th Meeting dated 
18.10.2022 that the field demonstration studies with respect to 
the effect of GE mustard on honey bees and other pollinators 
may be conducted post-environmental release. The said 
decision, besides causing adverse effects on the environment, 
would also be against the principle of assessing any harmful 
socio-economic impact in time, i.e., before granting approval. 
 
17.16 
Our attention was also drawn to various points 
regarding conflict of interest, details of which have also been 
given in the written submissions, which we shall advert to during 
the course of our discussion. 
 
17.17 
It was next submitted that the 1989 Rules are not 
compliant with the CPB, which was ratified by India on 
17.01.2003 and which came into effect on 11.09.2003. This is 
because the question of liability and redress are not addressed 
by the 1989 Rules. Sri Parekh noted that the CPB reaffirms the 
precautionary approach, which is also contained in Principle 15 
of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. 
Therefore, the decision of GEAC dated 25.10.2022 that tests with 
regard to the environmental impact of the release would be done 
post-release and not prior thereto, violates the aforesaid 
precautionary principle.  
 
 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 108 of 260 
 
 
 
17.18 
Finally, it was urged that HT seeds of transgenic 
mustard hybrid DMH-11 have been sown in five locations and in 
the absence of a proper and lawful approval of the same, the 
plants should be uprooted and destroyed immediately, so that 
no environmental contamination takes place. 
 
17.19 
Learned senior counsel, Sri Trideep Pais submitted 
that the procedure adopted by GEAC in the instant case, 
culminating in the order dated 25.10.2022, is not in accordance 
with law. In this regard, it was submitted that GEAC is a 
Committee which has been constituted under the 1989 Rules 
and is therefore, a statutory body. The said body cannot further 
delegate its functions to sub-committees or Expert Committees. 
Even if the assistance of such sub-committees or Expert 
Committees is taken, there has to be detailed deliberations of the 
recommendations made by the said Expert Committees and not 
simply accepted without any application of mind as has 
happened in the instant case.  
 
17.20 
It was further submitted that the health expert was 
consistently absent in all the crucial meetings of GEAC, and 
thereafter, the said expert sent an e-mail simply concurring with 
the deliberations of GEAC without any application of mind and 
in the absence of any participation in the deliberations. 
Consequently, the health aspect in the context of granting 
approval for environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11 has been totally ignored and kept apart, which is the 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 109 of 260 
 
 
 
reason why the petitioners as well as the interveners are pressing 
for appropriate reliefs on quashing of the decision dated 
25.10.2022. In this regard, learned senior counsel drew our 
attention to the various deliberations of the meetings with 
reference to the compilation of documents that he submitted. 
 
17.21 
Learned senior counsel Sri Pais further submitted that 
despite the order of this Court dated 12.08.2008 and the earlier 
order dated 08.04.2008 stating that the primary data pertaining 
to field trials must be placed in the public domain and on the 
website of GEAC, there has been absolute non-compliance of the 
same and as a result, it is neither in the public domain nor 
placed on record. 
 
17.22 
It was further contended that on the reconstitution of 
GEAC dated 17.07.2022, one of the members, Dr. Geeta Jotwani, 
was not present in the meeting held on 18.10.2022. GEAC simply 
approved the agenda Item No.4 on the said date. As already noted 
on 02.02.2016 in the 1st meeting of the sub-Committee of GEAC, 
Dr. B. Sesikeran, the Nutrition and Food Safety expert, was 
absent. The said expert was continuously absent thereafter on 
11.04.2016, 20.06.2016 and 11.08.2016 in the meetings of the 
sub-committee. Learned senior counsel therefore, submitted that 
GEAC, not having complied with the requisite procedures, has 
arrived at a decision to grant approval of the environmental 
release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 without taking 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 110 of 260 
 
 
 
into consideration all aspects of the matter in a comprehensive 
manner. 
 
17.23 
Sri Dhruv Dwivedi learned counsel submitted that the 
recommendation of the Parliamentary Committee on agriculture 
has not been considered by GEAC in its proper perspective. 
Further, the sub-committee of GEAC had recommended that the 
adverse impacts on honeybees and other pollinators had to be 
studied prior to the environmental release. However, the said 
decision was given a go by and it was decided that the said study 
would be conducted subsequent to the environmental release of 
DMH-11. This volte-face in the stand of GEAC is without any 
reason and also not in consonance with the precautionary 
principles which are relevant in the instant case. 
 
17.24 
Dr. Ravindra Chingale learned counsel appearing on 
behalf of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh as an intervenor, at the outset, 
submitted that these matters cannot be considered to be an 
adversarial litigation but wholly in public interest. Therefore, the 
respondent Union of India would have to adhere to the directions 
issued and to be issued by this Court in the matter. He further 
drew our attention to three unstarred questions answered in the 
Rajya Sabha by Hon’ble Minister of State for Environment. One 
of them was with regard to Section 22 of the FSSA, 2006, that 
the Central Government has not yet conducted any study on GM 
food and therefore, has not issued a notification under the 
aforesaid provision. In the absence of such a notification, there 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 111 of 260 
 
 
 
can be no steps taken having regard to the provisions of the 
FSSA, 2006. As per Section 2 of the said Act, the Union has 
declared that the food industry is taken under its control, which 
is expedient in the public interest in view of Entry 52, List I of 
the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The same shall be 
considered later. 
 
17.25 
He also drew our attention to Section 3(b) of the 
Patents Act, 1970, which states that an invention, the primary 
or intended use or commercial exploitation of which could be 
contrary to public order or morality or which causes serious 
prejudice to human, animal or plant life or health or to the 
environment, is not an invention within the meaning of the said 
Act and therefore, not patentable.  
 
Submissions of the Respondents: 
PART-I 
18. Sri R. Venkataramani, learned Attorney General, while 
defending the action of GEAC, contended that the petitioners 
have raised two concerns, namely, (i) the non-negotiable 
importance of having credible regulatory procedures, mechanism 
and institutions which are free from commercial incentives to 
ensure that proposals for release and use of GM crops and plants 
are subject to strict scrutiny through well-accepted regimes; and, 
(ii) all information and materials in relation to the regulatory 
procedures be made public to ensure participation of the public 
in order to bring about transparency and informed debate.  

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 112 of 260 
 
 
 
 
18.1 Based on the above contentions, the petitioners have 
sought that unless certain precautions are taken, the Union of 
India shall not release GMOs into the environment by way of 
import, manufacture, use or any other manner. More specifically, 
the petitioners have sought directions with regard to approval 
dated 25.10.2022 recommended by GEAC by clearing for 
environmental release transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 
following fairly long stages of trial conducted by ICAR, CGMCP; 
Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh (IMTECH), NIN, 
Hyderabad, Amar Immunodiagnostics Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad and 
Premas Biotech Pvt. Ltd., Manesar.   
 
18.2 It was submitted by learned Attorney General that by order 
dated 10.05.2012 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.260 of 2005, this 
Court was pleased to appoint an expert committee (TEC) 
consisting of technical experts to submit a report with certain 
terms of reference. TEC submitted an interim report on 
07.10.2012 and Union of India raised objections in response to 
the said report, which were referred to TEC on 09.11.2012. On 
30.06.2013, the TEC submitted its final report making certain 
suggestions. According to the learned Attorney General, the TEC 
Report goes beyond the terms of reference, to the extreme extent 
of observing that HT crops are completely unsuitable in the 
Indian context. But, Dr. Paroda has filed a separate dissenting 
report raising serious objections to the procedures and

deliberations of the TEC that virtually worked with a closed 
mind. 
 
18.3 It was then submitted that these writ petitions were filed in 
2004-2005 respectively and since then, there has been 
development in the regulatory framework governing the field and 
the following guidelines and protocols are applicable to the 
research and testing of GMOs:  
i.  Guidelines and SOPs for Conduct of Confined Field Trials of 
Regulated GE Plants, 2008. 
ii.  Revised Guidelines for Research in Transgenic Plants, 1998. 
iii.  Guidelines for Safety Assessment of Foods Derived from GE 
plants, 2008 (updated in 2012). 
iv.  Protocols for Food and Feed Safety Assessment of GE Crops, 
2008. 
v.  Guidelines for the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of 
GE Plants, 2016. 
vi.  Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of GE Plants: A Guide 
for Stakeholders, 2016. 
vii.  Risk Analysis Framework, 2016. 
 
18.4 The aforesaid regulatory framework has been developed 
after the filing of the present petitions and in view of these 
developments, these petitions have been rendered infructuous.  
That in view of the adequacy of the current regulatory regime in 
place, the petitions have lost their efficacy inasmuch there is no 
challenge to the constitutionality of the statute, rules or 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 114 of 260 
 
 
 
executive action and that a writ court cannot embark on a roving 
and fishing inquiry in a public interest litigation. 
 
18.5 Emphasising that the focus of the writ petition is now 
confined to the environmental release of transgenic mustard 
DMH-11, it was submitted that on receipt of the application 
requesting a trial of DMH-11 to be conducted, approval was given 
by GEAC on 29.09.2010 and subsequently, approvals were 
granted to conduct BRL-I and BRL-II trials. Only after several 
meetings, deliberations and consideration of the reports of the 
trials, on 18.10.2022, GEAC recommended environmental 
release of DMH-11 subject to strict conditions and safeguards 
and accordingly, permission for environmental release of DMH-
11 was issued on 25.10.2022. 
 
18.6 It was further submitted that the regulatory requirements 
are adequate to address all aspects of the concerns voiced by the 
petitioners and the rules and guidelines are in consonance with 
the CPB and Codex principles and guidelines on foods derived 
from biotechnology.   
 
18.7 It was further argued that even the concerns expressed by 
the TEC Report have since been adequately addressed by the 
Union of India. The TEC Report was written in the background 
of the existing regulatory regime, which as noted above, has 
subsequently been updated. The regulatory regime in place has 
been strengthened to ensure that a comprehensive, transparent 
and science-based framework of GM crops is in place for ERA of 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 115 of 260 
 
 
 
GM crops. That rigorous risk analysis approach has been applied 
to ensure the safety of both the environmental and health risks 
vis-à-vis transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 for the past ten 
years.   
 
18.8 Therefore, learned Attorney General submitted that the 
scope of adjudication now stands confined to the question of due 
procedure being followed under the relevant rules and the 
guidelines and there is no need to traverse beyond this limited 
inquiry. It was emphasised that the question that should be 
addressed by this Court would revolve around due processes 
being followed and deliberations on the varying understandings 
on applications of science and technology would lie in the domain 
of the Government alone and mere differences of opinions cannot 
invite the Court’s attention into the evaluation of views and 
adopting or rejecting any one of them.   
 
18.9 Learned Attorney General then proceeded to argue that the 
petitioners’ concern regarding risk with regard to environmental 
release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 is purely 
hypothetical and there is a distinction between a risk which is 
clearly known and demonstrated and presumption of risk on 
unproven hypotheses. Even under the precautionary principle 
approach, a rigid and uncompromising approach is not 
encouraged insofar as it stifles technological advancement. That 
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) describes risk 
assessment as a scientific process consisting of the following 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 116 of 260 
 
 
 
steps: (i) hazard identification, (ii) hazard characterisation, (iii) 
exposure assessment, and (iv) risk categorization. There is also a 
principle that an analysis of benefit versus risk is undertaken to 
determine the actions that provide the greatest benefits while 
encountering the least risk. In the instant case, the procedures 
adopted for the environmental clearance are argued to be in 
consonance with the above said steps. To seek judicial scrutiny 
of the same would, thus, be inappropriate and will amount to 
dislodging governance responsibility in taking decisions on a 
consideration of all relevant factors. Therefore, this Court ought 
not to enter into any evaluation of rival views on the subject of 
GMOs in general and the issue of environmental release of DMH-
11 in particular. 
 
PART-II 
I. 
Overview of the Technology: 
18.10 
It was contended that the conditional approval was 
given on 25.10.2022 to the CGMCP, University of Delhi, for 
environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 
and parental lines bn.36 and modbs 2.99 containing barnase, 
barstar and bar genes. The object was to create DMH-11 – a 
hybrid obtained by crossing Varuna bn 3.6 (containing bar, 
barnase genes) with EH-2 modbs 2.99 (containing bar, barstar 
genes). The three relevant genes used in the process of creating 
DMH-11 are as follows: barnase gene which makes the plant 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 117 of 260 
 
 
 
male sterile; barstar gene which restores male fertility; and bar 
gene which confers HT.  
Presently, Varuna mustard seed contains both male and 
female parts and is self-pollinating (self-fertilization). It is first 
made male sterile so that it can be pollinated and crossed with 
another variety. This is achieved by introducing the barnase 
gene. Hence, a male sterile Varuna bn 3.6 is created (containing 
bar, barnase genes).  Since Varuna bn 3.6 is male sterile, it cannot 
self-pollinate to reproduce.  For multiplying this parental line, it 
is crossed with normal Varuna which produces a crop which is 
50% Varuna bn 3.6 (male sterile) and 50% normal Varuna 
(fertile).  This progeny crop is then planted in an alternating 
arrangement with EH-2 modbs 2.99 plants (containing bar, 
barstar genes). At this stage, herbicide is sprayed at the site 
which eliminates the fertile (normal varuna) portion of the 
progeny crop (since it does not have HT) leaving behind the 
portion of the progeny crop which is male sterile, i.e. Varuna bn 
3.6 (since it contains the bar gene which confers HT). This is 
termed a selection event. The male sterile Varuna bn 3.6 
remaining from the progeny crop gets fertilized by the adjacent 
EH-2 modbs 2.99 crop (which also contains the bar gene and 
survives the herbicide) and produces the hybrid seed DMH-11.  
 
18.11 
Thus, DMH-11 is produced, containing all three genes 
i.e. barnase, barstar and bar.  It is fully fertile since the barnase 
gene inherited from EH-2 modbs 2.99 restores the male fertility

of the resulting hybrid.  The bar gene inherited in DMH-11 is of 
no utility in the hybrid.  Its utility is at the selection event, 
namely, to multiply the male sterile Varuna bn 3.6. This male 
sterility/restorer system is a highly promising technology which 
can be used to produce new hybrids with higher yields in future, 
thereby increasing agricultural output and farmer income.   
 
II. 
Herbicide Tolerance (HT): 
18.12 
It was contended that a crop is referred to as an HT 
variety if its commercial trait is HT, but DMH-11 is not such a 
crop since the HT trait in DMH-11 is of no commercial utility. In 
fact, transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 is not developed as HT 
Technology and it is unnecessary to use herbicide in the 
cultivation of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11.  In fact, the 
HT trait is useful only at the selection event during the 
development phase of the event and is of no utility when the crop 
is being cultivated by a farmer.  
 
18.13 
It was also pointed out that under the EP Act, 1986, 
and the Insecticides Act, 1968, use of herbicide is, anyway, not 
permitted in the field for cultivation of transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11. 
 
III. 
Yield: 
18.14 
Learned Attorney General contended that in the BRL-
I and BRL-II trials, an increase in per-hectare yield by 25-30 per 
cent has been demonstrated against national check Varuna and 
zonal check RL1359. Only after the environmental release of 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 119 of 260 
 
 
 
DMH-11, significant clarity would emerge from the trials that are 
conducted by ICAR. Therefore, environmental release is the first 
step in a long process of evolution of this technology which will 
lead to even better hybrids in future.   
 
18.15 
According to the learned Attorney General, there is 
proven use and safety of genes used in transgenic mustard 
hybrid DMH-11.  The three genes, barnase, barstar and bar have 
more than twenty years of safe history of being in the food chain 
in GE rapeseed, a sister crop of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-
11. The regulatory authorities in the USA, Canada and Australia 
have allowed the cultivation of GE rapeseed containing the bar, 
barnase and barstar genes. Between 1996 – 2003, parental lines 
and hybrids were released for cultivation in Canada, USA and 
Australia.  
 
18.16 
It was submitted that under Rule 4 of the 1989 Rules, 
the following bodies namely, GEAC, Recombinant DNA Advisory 
Committee (RDAC), RCGM, IBSC and SBCC have been 
constituted and the applicable guidelines have been enumerated 
above.  
 
18.17 
Emphasising that the RCGM and GEAC together 
examine the safety assessment data submitted by the applicant 
at every step of the regulatory process, the learned Attorney 
General noted that the regulatory mechanism is completely 
transparent.  All the data, reports, decisions etc. are made 
publicly available. Therefore, the conditional approval for 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 120 of 260 
 
 
 
environmental release prior to commercial release is subject to 
necessary regulatory and technical oversight and the approval 
has been granted after following detailed and exhaustive 
procedure in law, including after considering biosafety data and 
rigorous scrutiny over a period of twelve years. GEAC considered 
the application for environmental release only when the 
applicant had completed three years of BRL Trials (two years of 
BRL-I trials and one year of BRL-II trials) and a 3251 page dossier 
containing results of all the biosafety studies was submitted to 
GEAC and its sub-committees.  As per the public consultation 
process prescribed in the Risk Analysis Framework 2016, the 
AFES Report was uploaded on the official website of MoEF&CC 
for inviting comments from 05.09.2016 to 05.10.2016 and about 
twenty-nine persons personally inspected the complete dossier 
at the premises and provided their comments. 
 
18.18 
It was submitted that in fact, the permission for 
environment release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 is 
granted for following limited purpose: 
i. 
To use the events of environmental release of transgenic 
mustard hybrid DMH-11 for developing new parental lines 
and hybrids under the supervision of ICAR. 
ii. 
To undertake seed production of transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11 and its testing as per existing ICAR guidelines and 
other extant rules/regulations prior to its commercial 
release.

iii. To generate scientific evidence in the Indian agro-climatic 
situation of the environment release. 
iv. As a precautionary mechanism, post-environmental release, 
conduct the field demonstration studies with respect to the 
effect of GE mustard on honeybees and other pollinators, as 
recommended in the 136th GEAC meeting within two years 
under supervision of ICAR, as per its guidelines and other 
extant rules, guidelines and regulations and the report be 
submitted to GEAC.    
 However, the above is subjected to stringent terms and 
conditions to ensure environmental safeguards.  
 
18.19 
On the TEC Report, learned Attorney General 
submitted that though HT crops were not a part of terms of 
reference, the five-member TEC report has referred to the same 
and recommended against the use thereof in India. The Union of 
India too had filed objections stating that this recommendation 
was beyond the scope of terms of references and such a decision 
must be left to the regulatory system.  In any case, the focus in 
the instant matter is only on DMH-11, which is not an HT crop. 
According to the learned Attorney General, since 2012, the 
regulatory regime has been strengthened to ensure that a 
comprehensive transparent and science-based framework of GM 
crops is in place for ERA of GM crops.   
 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 122 of 260 
 
 
 
18.20 
Finally, it was contended that mustard is the most 
important edible oil and seed meal crop of India and at present, 
55-60 percent of the edible oil demand is met through imports. 
It was stated that canola oil is made from GM canola seeds; and 
soyabean oil largely comprises GM soyabean oil. Thus, the 
petitioners have voiced unfounded fears of adverse impact of GM 
crops, even when India is already importing and consuming oil 
derived from said GM crops.  The transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11 has shown an increase per-hectare yield by 25-30 per 
cent over the traditional varieties due to exploitation of hybrid 
vigour. As mustard is one of the highest oil-bearing of oilseeds 
utilised in India, the domestic production of edible oil would 
considerably increase if DMH-11 hybrid technology is employed.    
 Hence, learned Attorney General sought for dismissal of 
the writ petitions. 
 
Submissions of Learned Solicitor General: 
19. Learned Solicitor General Sri Tushar Mehta, while 
supporting the arguments of the learned Attorney General, at the 
outset contended that any ban on commercial/public release of 
GM crops in India will be against public and national interest. 
55-60 percent of the edible oil in India is imported and mustard 
oil is one of the most important edible oils. In order to ensure 
food security and reduction of foreign dependency, it is necessary 
to strengthen the plant breeding programmes in India, including 
use of new genetic technologies such as GE technology.  
 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 123 of 260 
 
 
 
19.1 Drawing our attention to statistics regarding the demand for 
total edible oil in India, it was submitted that 55.76 per cent of 
the total demand of edible oil is made through import, out of 
which palm oil, soyabean oil, sunflower oil and a small quantity 
of canola quality mustard oil are being imported. It was 
contended that owing to increasing population and oil 
consumption over the years, the imports have significantly 
increased in India.  
 
19.2 Reiterating that globally around 80 percent of soyabean is 
GM soyabean variety, it was underlined that the petitioners were 
only voicing unfounded fears. The transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11 having shown increased per-hectare yield over the 
traditional varieties, domestic production of edible oil is bound 
to rise considerably through the GM variety. 
 
19.3 It was next submitted that competing fundamental rights of 
different sections of the society would have to be balanced. On 
the one hand, essential food including edible oil at affordable 
prices has to be made available, while at the same time, the 
dependency on import has to be reduced. That owing to the 
increasing demand for edible oil in India, making available the 
same at an economic price is a fundamental right of the citizens. 
Therefore, the production of indigenous edible oil is necessary to 
meet the increasing demand for such oil. It was argued by the 
learned Solicitor General that there were certain sections of the 
population who did not wish that India should be self-sufficient 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 124 of 260 
 
 
 
and self-reliant in essential food and instead encouraged 
importing edible oil, which is not in the interest of the Indian 
economy.  
 
19.4 It was submitted that the petitioners have failed to satisfy 
as to how restricting the trials would, in any way, have an 
adverse impact on the environment or otherwise. The public 
interest and fundamental rights of the citizens of the country to 
have the benefit of reasonable price of mustard oil has to 
outweigh the so-called concerns expressed by the petitioners 
herein. The learned Solicitor General accused that the petitions 
have been filed only to arm twist the State and in order to support 
greater imports of the essential commodities. In this context, it 
was submitted by him that the Union of India is committed to 
increasing crop productivity and the income of farmers through 
development of low input – high output agriculture and making 
the country self-sufficient in edible oil and grain legumes and 
that the strengthening of plant breeding programme, including 
the use of new genetic technologies, is critical for that purpose. 
  
19.5 He noted that an elaborate statutory scheme exists to 
ensure effective regulatory review for the research, development 
and commercial use of GE technologies. The petitioners have not, 
however, pointed out a single flaw on record in the existing 
statutory regime or its implementation in the trial of DMH-11. 
Therefore, the writ petitions have to be dismissed with heavy 
costs. In this regard, reliance was placed on a recent judgment 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 125 of 260 
 
 
 
of this Court in the case of Jacob Puliye vs. Union of India, 
(2022) SCC OnLine SC 533 (“Jacob Puliye”) with special 
reference to paragraph Nos.21, 22, 62 and 80-81, and three other 
judgments of this Court, namely, National High Speed Rail 
Corporation Limited vs. Montecarlo Limited, (2022) 6 SCC 
401 (“Montecarlo Limited”),  Narmada Bachao Andolan vs. 
Union of India, (2000) 10 SCC 664 (“Narmada Bachao”) and 
Uflex Limited vs. Government of Tamil Nadu, (2022) 1 SCC 
165 (“Uflex Limited”) to contend that frivolous public interest 
litigation must be dismissed with heavy costs, particularly, when 
an interim injunction affects the public interest. This is because, 
in the instant case, there is no material produced to demonstrate 
as to how the existing statutory regime relating to GM crops 
violates the fundamental rights of the citizens or is opposed to 
the provisions of the Constitution, or is opposed to any statutory 
provisions, or is otherwise manifestly arbitrary. Hence, the writ 
petitions may be dismissed with costs.  
 
Reply Arguments: 
20. Sri Prashant Bhushan submitted his rejoinder arguments 
with reference to the arguments of the learned Attorney General 
by contending that DMH-11 is a HT Crop, as is evident from the 
admission of the Union of India in the note submitted by the 
learned Attorney General himself to the effect that “the presence 
of the third HT gene (Bar) is essential for hybrid seed production”.  
Therefore, the presence of the HT gene (Bar) makes DMH-11 an 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 126 of 260 
 
 
 
HT Crop. This was also said to be in accordance with the finding 
of the 2017 PSC Report which stated that transgenic mustard 
hybrid DMH-11 is an HT Crop.  
 
20.1 It was then pointed out that there is clear evidence on the 
adverse impacts of such GMOs from other places in the world. In 
this regard, reference was made to various experts’ opinions as 
under:  
(i) 
Dr. Jack Heinemann, Director, Centre for Integrated 
Research 
in 
Biosafety, 
University 
of 
Canterbury, 
Christchurch, Netherlands, who served as an advisor to the 
Food & Agriculture Organisation, stated that DMH-11 is an 
HT crop. 
(ii) In an “Open Statement on Bar Gene in GM Mustard” 
published on 10.12.2022, by Dr. Soma Sundar Marla, 
Former Principal Scientist, Crop Bioinformatics & Genomics, 
ICAR-NBPGR, New Delhi and other scientists and experts, it 
was stated that DMH-11 is an HT crop in the following 
words:  
“Technically, it is the presence of the gene construct 
the Bar gene which defines whether a crop is 
Herbicide Tolerant (HT) or not. Given that both 
parents of DMH-11 carry gene constructs containing 
Bar, which confers herbicide tolerance towards 
glufosinate, any offspring from such parents 
including DMH-11 shall carry the HT trait. Therefore 
not only parental lines, but DMH-11 is also tolerant 
to herbicide without any doubt.”

(iii) Further, 
in 
the 
article 
titled, 
“Long-term 
ecological, 
environmental effects of herbicide tolerant crops haven’t been 
considered” published on 29.11.2022 in the Indian Express, 
by Dr. Renee Borges and other distinguished professors and 
scientists, DMH-11 was confirmed as an HT crop. It was 
stated as under: 
“A central feature of DMH-11 is that it carries a gene 
for herbicide resistance (also termed herbicide 
tolerance or HT). This fact has not received 
appropriate 
consideration. 
The 
deployment 
of 
herbicide-resistant 
or 
HT 
crops 
has 
been 
accompanied by deleterious outcomes in several 
places including the US, Australia, and Canada (so-
called developed countries) as well as Argentina (a 
developing country). The most well-established 
harmful consequences have been the spread of 
herbicide-resistant weeds across large tracts of 
agricultural land, which can spell disaster for the 
normal crop.  
Thus, 
notwithstanding 
the 
statement 
of 
the 
developers and its implicit acceptance by GEAC, 
DMH-11 does meet the definition of an HT crop. The 
answers to two questions show this. Is DMH-11 
herbicide tolerant? Yes. Is it a crop? Yes. The intent 
of the developer on how it is actually likely to be 
used, especially if that usage appears to confer 
obvious advantages.” 
 
(iv) It was contended that as DMH-11 is an HT crop, all hybrids 
produced therefrom will also be HT crops and the TEC 
appointed by this Court has in its detailed report submitted 
to this Court recommended a complete ban on all HT crops.

20.2 It was further submitted that the report titled, “Biology of 
Brassica Juncea (Indian mustard)” prepared by the MoEF&CC 
and DRMR, Bharatpur under United Nations Environment 
Programme 
(UNEP)/ 
Global 
Environment 
Facility 
(GEF) 
supported the regions of South Western China and North 
Western Himalayas, which constitute two secondary centres 
where there is enormous diversity in Brassica Juncea forms; that 
there is evidence for the existence of two geographical races of 
Brassica Juncea, the Chinese pool and the Indian pool. Further, 
five countries share nearly 60% of Brassica germplasm holdings 
led by China (17%) and followed by India (15%), United Kingdom 
(UK) (10%), USA (9%) and Germany (8%). India presents a rich 
diversity of rapeseed- mustard group of crops.  
 
20.3 It was next submitted that glufosinate is banned for all 
other uses except for tea plantations and is specifically banned 
for use on DMH-11 by farmers; this is because glufosinate 
causes toxicity which would lead to resistance. However, 
glufosinate is otherwise available to farmers who have access to 
it.  
 
20.4 That, the TEC report has pointed to the acute toxicity and 
health concerns such as carcinogenicity, reproductive and 
developmental toxicity, and endocrine disruption. That, long 
term studies show that an exposure to glufosinate would have 
adverse effects, which may not be evident in short term studies. 
That, even as per the information made available by Bayer,

BASTA containing glufosinate ammonium is neurotoxic and has 
adverse effect on aquatic life.   
 
20.5 It was reiterated that in the biosafety dossier of HT 
mustard, the primary data dossier, is, in fact, not in the public 
domain. The biosafety dossier contains the primary data on the 
basis of which the AFES Report was prepared. However, the 
biosafety dossier containing 3251 pages was only available for 
physical inspection at the MoEF&CC headquarters and in 
response, petitioner’s counsel had written to GEAC requesting 
the dossier to be put on the website so that it could be examined 
by independent experts. It was replied that in no country with 
functional regulatory system is the full dossier made available 
publicly due to reasons of protection of intellectual property.  
 
20.6 That, in fact Dr. P.M. Bhargava, in his critique of the AFES 
Report, had pointed out that it was not possible to evaluate the 
statements made in the said Report as the primary data had not 
been provided in the Report. Therefore, it is all the more 
necessary that the biosafety dossier be put in the public domain 
so as to enable independent experts to review the same.  
 
20.7 It was next submitted that no chronic/long term studies 
have been conducted on HT mustard. It was stressed that the 
petitioners’ concern is the irreversible risk of contamination that 
the country faces, if environmental release of GMOs is permitted 
in the absence of any chronic studies vis-à-vis human health, 
livestock, environment, biodiversity etc. It was pointed out that 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 130 of 260 
 
 
 
Union of India was silent as to the measures undertaken to 
ensure non-contamination. The Union of India was also silent 
about the measures undertaken in respect of labelling of GM 
foods, in light of the fact that no chronic studies have been 
commissioned as regards the consumption of GM foods. Also, the 
Union of India was silent as to the liability of the applicant and 
GEAC for potential losses to farmers and consumers on account 
of irreversible contamination.  
 
20.8 In this regard, the TEC Report was referred to, wherein it 
has been stated that currently eighteen new food crop species, 
for which applications for field trial have been received in the 
Indian system, are - cauliflower, cabbage, corn, rice, wheat, 
tomato, groundnut, potato, sorghum, okra, brinjal, mustard, 
papaya, watermelon, sugarcane, etc. Also, the growth of GM crop 
would impact organic food producers and given the difficulties in 
segregation of GM and non-GM foods, it would be difficult to meet 
the criteria for organic food. This was said to have potential 
adverse impact on export of organic food, as the importers would 
closely examine the conditions under which organic food is being 
grown and any concern about contamination could lead to an 
adverse impact and loss of markets for organic food producers.  
 
20.9 It was further submitted that GEAC, the regulator, has 
failed to deal with the illegal plantation of HT Bt cotton and the 
same is being grown in the country illegally on commercial basis. 
In fact, the intervenor in the present proceedings, Shetkari 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 131 of 260 
 
 
 
Sangathan, has also been illegally planting Bt brinjal and has 
been encouraging farmers to do so, and GEAC has failed to check 
the same.  
 
20.10 It was next submitted that large quantities of GM 
processed oil was being imported in the form of canola oil 
sourced largely from GM canola seeds and soyabean oil sourced 
from GM soyabean seeds. It was argued that this is in violation 
of the law.  
 
20.11 Section 22 of the FSSA, 2006 prohibits manufacture, 
distribution, sale or import of any GMO products, except in 
accordance with the regulations which the Central Government 
may notify. This has been a subject matter of a judgment of this 
Court in Writ Petition (Civil) No.173 of 2006, Vandana Shiva 
vs. Union of India, disposed of on 11.08.2017, wherein it was 
recorded that there was no notification or regulation allowing any 
activity in connection with GE and modified food and such 
activity was permissible only under the regulations framed under 
Section 22 of the FSSA, 2006.  The said writ petition was 
disposed of by allowing liberty to the petitioner therein to 
approach this Court again after regulations framed in connection 
with GE and modified food under Section 22 of the FSSA, 2006, 
are placed for consideration by the Parliament, in order to test 
their legality upon constitutional sustainability. However, till 
date, no notification has been issued by the Union of India.

20.12 In addition, it was pointed out that GEAC in their 
communication addressed to Directorate General of Foreign 
Trade (DGFT), dated 23.02.2018, had informed that it had not 
authorised or approved GM soyabean or any other products 
derived from GM soyabean seeds for import or cultivation in 
India. That being the case, it is not known on what basis is GM 
food being imported to India. 
 
20.13 It was next submitted that there was a failure to undertake 
any socio-economic risk analysis by GEAC with regard to the 
failure of Bt cotton in accordance with the CBD and CPB. The 
need for such an assessment was also highlighted by TEC. 
 
20.14 In this regard, reference was made to Mahyco Monsanto 
Biotec (India) Private Ltd. vs. Union of India, Writ Petition 
(Civil) No.12069 of 2015, filed before the Delhi High Court, in 
which the petitioner therein had challenged the price control 
order issued by the Union of India under the Essential 
Commodities Act, 1955 as regards Bt cotton seeds. The challenge 
is pending before the Delhi High Court. Pertinently, the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India, in the 
said case, has stated that the farmers across the country have 
been financially burdened due to the increasing prices of Bt 
cotton seeds. They have also to spend on pesticides and other 
resources to make the crops more pest resistant and high-
yielding. This has resulted in escalated expenses and reduced 
the margin of profit for the farmers.  

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 133 of 260 
 
 
 
 
20.15 It was also brought to our notice that the pink bollworm, 
a major pest to the cotton crop, has developed resistance in the 
last two or three years and has worried the farmers who have 
sown Bt cotton seeds. That, the cotton yields were stagnant in 
the last five years due to the fact that the technology was used 
not for yield improvement but only for prevention of loss.  
 
20.16 Referring to Article 14(1)(b) of the Argentina Convention, it 
was submitted that a duty is cast on the Government of India to 
assess the impact of its policies and minimize adverse impacts, 
as India is a signatory to the said convention.  
 
20.17 It was, thus, argued that the 1989 Rules, which are prior 
in time to the CPB, have to be brought in line with the said 
protocol. Similarly, the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, casts a 
duty on the Central Government to protect biodiversity as per 
Section 36 of the said Act. In this regard, reference was made to 
the judgment of this Court in Gramophone Company of India 
Ltd. vs. Birendra Bahadur Pandey, (1984) 2 SCC 534 
(“Gramophone Co. of India Ltd.”), and Vishaka vs. State of 
Rajasthan, (1997) 6 SCC 241 (“Vishaka”), which dealt with 
the doctrine of incorporation of international law into Indian law 
and how the same could be read to be part of national law unless 
they are in conflict with an Act of Parliament.   
 
20.18 Further, any international convention not inconsistent 
with the fundamental rights and in harmony with its spirit must 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 134 of 260 
 
 
 
be read into these provisions to enlarge the meaning and content 
thereof, so as to promote the object of the constitutional 
guarantee. 
 
20.19 Similarly, reference was made to Nilabati Behera vs. 
State of Orissa, (1993) 2 SCC 746 (“Nilabati Behera”), 
wherein the absence of an enacted law to provide for effective 
enforcement of the basic human right of gender equality was held 
to give the basis for using international conventions and norms 
to construe and give meaning to fundamental rights guaranteed 
under the Constitution of India.  
 
20.20 It was also submitted that the present regulatory system 
continues to be deficient and therefore, there is a need for putting 
in place a suitable regulatory system which would work within 
the framework of its mandate.  
 
20.21 In conclusion, it was submitted that the petitioners were 
seeking implementation of the recommendations of the TEC. 
That the TEC Report has been given a go-by by GEAC in 
consideration of the application made by Prof. Pental, Former 
Professor of Genetics and Vice-Chancellor, University of Delhi, 
South Campus, New Delhi. Therefore, the petitioners have 
sought the aforesaid reliefs. 
 
Points for Consideration:  
21. Before framing the points for consideration, we make it 
clear that this case does not decide the competing claims made 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 135 of 260 
 
 
 
in the scientific literature about the desirability of GMOs, their 
impact on increasing crop yield in the short or long term and 
other subjects that belong to the domain of scientific and 
agricultural experts. This Court is not conducting a review or an 
evaluation of various scientific studies submitted by the 
petitioners and the respondents on GMOs. This Court does not 
have the institutional competence and therefore any conclusion 
raised on that basis would be a futile exercise.  
 
21.1  The purpose of our adjudication is to satisfy our judicial 
conscience on the subject of critical public interest. We have 
viewed the matter from the perspective of compliances of the 
principles of exercise of discretion and use of administrative 
power in a niche area where opinions of scientists and experts in 
the field would determine the course of action to be taken in a 
matter as significant as the steps leading to the decision for 
environmental release of DMH-11 mustard in an altered 
technology. 
 
21.2   This case also does not decide on the divergent substantive 
content and recommendations made by the TEC or GEAC. The 
ambit of the present case is strictly limited to compliance with 
constitutional and legal requirements in the decision-making 
process impugned herein. In light of the aforesaid, and the 
submissions advanced by learned senior counsel and counsel for 
respective parties, the following points would arise for our 
consideration: 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 136 of 260 
 
 
 
(i) 
Whether GEAC approval dated 18.10.2022 and the 
consequent decision dated 25.10.2022 for the environmental 
release of DMH-11 is in accordance with law? 
(ii) Whether the decision to grant approval for environmental 
release of DMH-11 violates the right to safe and healthy 
environment under Article 21? 
(iii) Whether GEAC’s grant of approval dated 18.10.2022 and the 
decision dated 25.10.2022 for the environmental release of 
DMH-11 violate the precautionary principle? 
(iv) What order? 
 
Since there is a difference of opinion between the Members 
of this Bench vis-à-vis the validity of the decision taken for 
environmental release of DMH-11, from this stage onwards, I 
propose to opine for myself while my learned brother Karol, J. 
has prepared his separate opinion.  
 
Legal Framework: 
22. Before I proceed further, it would be useful to note that 
agriculture, including agricultural education and research, 
protection against pests and prevention of plant diseases, is a 
State subject enumerated as Entry 14 in List II (State List). Trade 
and commerce in, and the production, supply and distribution 
of, inter alia, foodstuffs, including edible oil seeds and oils, is in 
Entry 33(b) in List III (Concurrent List) of the Seventh Schedule. 
Rules and regulations made under the EP Act, 1986 are possibly 
referrable to Entry 97 of List I (Union List) since environment 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 137 of 260 
 
 
 
protection has not been specifically mentioned in either List II or 
List III of the Seventh Schedule, except for forest. For ease of 
reference, the aforesaid Entries of the Seventh Schedule as well 
as others are extracted as under: 
“Entry 52, List I: 
52.  Industries, the control of which by the Union is 
declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in 
the public interest.  
Entry 97, List I: 
97.  Any other matter not enumerated in List II or 
List III including any tax not mentioned in either 
of those Lists. 
Entry 6, List II:  
6.  Public health and sanitation; hospitals and 
dispensaries. 
Entry 14, List II: 
14.  Agriculture, including agricultural education 
and research, protection against pests and 
prevention of plant diseases.  
Entry 33(b), List III:  
33.  Trade and commerce in, and the production, 
supply and distribution of,- 
…    …  … 
(b)  foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils;” 
 
22.1 Article 48A of the Constitution of India is a Directive 
Principle of State Policy which speaks about protection and 
improvement of environment and safeguarding of forests and 
wild life. Likewise, Article 51A(g) casts upon citizens a 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 138 of 260 
 
 
 
fundamental duty to protect and improve the natural 
environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife. These 
Articles have to be read in the context of Article 21 of the 
Constitution, which has been expansively interpreted by this 
Court to include within its scope and ambit of the right to health 
and clean environment and ecology. For ready reference, the 
aforesaid Articles are extracted as under: 
“21. Protection of life and personal liberty.—No 
person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty 
except according to procedure established by law. 
x   x   x 
48A. Protection and improvement of environment 
and safeguarding of forests and wild life.—The State 
shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment 
and to safeguard the forests and wild life of the country. 
x   x   x 
51A. Fundamental duties.—It shall be the duty of every 
citizen of India—  
x   x   x 
(g) to protect and improve the natural environment 
including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life, and to have 
compassion for living creatures;” 
 
 
23. At this point, it is also observed that Article 21 also 
encompasses the right to food safety.  It is in this context that 
the FSSA, 2006 has been enacted and I would now advert to the 
provisions contained therein as well.  
 
23.1  FSSA, 2006 has been enacted pursuant to Entry 52, List I 
of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.  

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 139 of 260 
 
 
 
Section 2 of the said Act has declared that it is expedient in 
the public interest that the Union should take under its control 
the food industry.  
 
23.2 The Preamble of the FSSA, 2006, inter alia, states that it is 
an Act to consolidate the laws relating to food and to establish 
the FSSAI for laying down science-based standards for articles of 
food and to regulate their manufacture, storage, distribution, 
sale and import, to ensure availability of safe and wholesome 
food for human consumption. The following provisions under the 
FSSA, 2006 could be adverted to: 
“2. Declaration as to expediency of control by the 
Union.- It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the 
public interest that the Union should take under its 
control the food industry. 
 
3. Definitions. (1) In this Act, unless the context 
otherwise requires, –

23.3 It would be necessary to refer to Section 22 of the said Act, 
which deals with GM foods, organic foods, functional foods, 
proprietary foods, etc. The said Section reads as under: 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 142 of 260

26.2 According to learned Attorney General, the 1989 Rules are 
implemented by the aforesaid competent authorities through a 
series of biosafety guidelines issued from time to time. The 
Guidelines applicable to GE plants are: 
(i)  
Guidelines and SOP for Conduct of Confined Field 
Trials of Regulated GE Plants, 2008. 
 
(ii)  
Revised Guidelines for Research in Transgenic 
Plants, 1998;  
 
(iii)  
Regulations and Guidelines for Recombinant DNA 
Research and Biocontainment, 2017. 
 
(iv)  
Guidelines for Safety Assessment of Foods Derived 
from GE Plants, 2008 (updated in 2012) 
 
(v)  
Protocols for Food and Feed Safety Assessment of 
GE Crops, 2008.  
 
(vi)  
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of GE Plants: 
A Guide for Stakeholders, 2016. 
 
(vii)  Risk Analysis Framework, 2016. 
 
(vii) 
Guidelines for the Environmental Risk Assessment 
of GE Plants, 2016. 
 
26.3 The research and development (R&D) with respect to GE 
plants has to be conducted in accordance with the Revised 
Guidelines for Research in Transgenic Plants, 1998. As per these 
Guidelines, the experiments conducted on research of transgenic 
plants are broadly categorized into three categories based on the 
risk involved, namely, Category I that involves routine rDNA 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 161 of 260 
 
 
 
experiments, Category II involving evaluation of transgenic 
plants in green house/net house, and Category III that pertains 
to high-risk experiments. These experiments have to be regulated 
by the IBSC and/or the RCGM, as prescribed in the Guidelines. 
 
26.4 Subsequent to the above experiments conducted under the 
contained conditions, the confined field trials have to be 
conducted as prescribed under the Guidelines and SOP for the 
Conduct of Confined Field Trials of Regulated GE Plants, 2008. 
 
26.5 The initial assessment of an application for a confined field 
trial begins at the institutional level itself. Based on information 
generated by the applicant in the laboratory and the greenhouse, 
an application is made to the IBSC for permission to conduct a 
confined field trial. The IBSC evaluates the proposal for 
conducting a field trial and further recommends it to the other 
Regulatory Authorities. The confined field trials are categorized 
as under: 
(i)  Biosafety Research Level-I (BRL-I) Trials: These trials are 
limited in size to no more than 1 acre (0.4 ha) per trial site 
location and a maximum cumulative total of 20 acres (8.1 
ha) for all locations for each plant species/construct 
combination (e.g., one or more events originating from 
transformation of a plant species with the same genetic 
construct), per applicant, per crop season. 
(ii) Biosafety Research Level-II (BRL-II) Trials: These are 
limited in size to no more than 2.5 acres (1 ha) per trial site

location and number of locations to be decided on a case by 
case basis for each plant species/construct combination 
(e.g., one or more events originating from transformation of 
a plant species with the same genetic construct), per 
applicant, per crop season. 
The RCGM is the regulatory authority for BRL-I trials and 
GEAC is the regulatory authority for BRL-II trials, as per the 
Guidelines for the Conduct of Confined Field Trials of Regulated 
GE Plants, 2008. 
 
26.6 Applications for environmental release are processed in 
accordance with Guidelines for the Environmental Risk 
Assessment (ERA) of GE Plants, 2016.  
 
26.7 The Risk Analysis Framework, 2016 prescribes the 
Regulatory Agency's approach to risk analysis. It is based on 
national and international standards and guidance, including 
the CPB to which India is a party. In accordance with the Risk 
Analysis Framework, 2016, assessment of safety of GM plants is 
a comprehensive process involving subject experts and ensures 
transparency in the regulatory decision-making process by 
incorporating stakeholder consultations. 
 
26.8 As per this framework, regulatory agencies seek views from 
various stakeholders and the steps followed in this consultation 
process include: 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 163 of 260 
 
 
 
(i)  
The communication of information about submission of 
applications for environmental release of GE plants to 
the regulatory agency. 
(ii) 
Preparation of a RARM plan for each application by the 
regulatory agencies. 
(iii) 
RARM plan uploaded on the official website for receiving 
comments from the stakeholders for a period of 30 days. 
(iv) 
The regulatory agency gives its recommendations after 
due consideration of the responses received from the 
stakeholders. 
 
26.9 That in line with the above, the applicant has to follow a 
clearly laid out step by step process for biosafety data generation 
from laboratory to field trials, safety tests and submission of 
application for environmental release. The biosafety data is 
generated in laboratories and by confined field trials under 
conditions authorized by the RCGM and GEAC, as per the 
guidelines and protocols and in recognized laboratories/ 
institutions/universities.  
 
27. In the context of the crucial role of the regulatory bodies, 
particularly with regard to food safety and environment, this 
Court in Writ Petition (Civil) No.202 of 1995 (In Re: T.N. 
Godavarman Thirumulpad vs. Union of India), order dated 
31.01.2024, speaking through Gavai, J. in paragraphs 22-25 
and 28-32, has observed as under: 
 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 164 of 260 
 
 
 
“22. As new bodies, authorities, and regulators for 
environmental governance emerge from time to time, 
their 
institutionalisation 
assumes 
extraordinary 
importance. Institutionalisation means that these bodies 
must work in compliance with institutional norms of 
efficiency, integrity and certainty. In this context, the 
role of the constitutional courts is even greater. 
 
23. Environmental Rule of Law: Environmental rule of 
law refers to environmental governance that is 
undergirded by the fundamental tenets of rule of law. 
The rule of law regime is one that has effective, 
accountable, and transparent institutions; responsive, 
inclusive, participatory, and representative decision 
making; and public access to information. It recognises 
the vital role that institutions play in governance and 
focuses on defining the structural norms and processes 
that guide institutional decision making.  
 
24. While several laws, rules, and regulations exist for 
protection of the environment, their objective is not 
achieved as there is a considerable gap as these laws 
remain unenforced or ineffectively implemented. Rule of 
law in environmental governance seeks to redress this 
issue as the implementation gap has a direct bearing on 
the protection of the environment, forests, wildlife, 
sustainable development, and public health, eventually 
affecting fundamental human rights to a clean 
environment that are intrinsically tied to right to life. 
Accountability of the authorities impressed with the 
duty to enforce and implement environmental and other 
ecological laws is an important feature of judicial 
governance. In the context of accountability, this Court 
in Vijay Rajmohan vs. CBI, (2023) 1 SCC 329 has held: 
 
“34. Accountability in itself is an essential principle 
of 
administrative 
law. 
Judicial 
review 
of 
administrative 
action 
will 
be 
effective 
and 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 165 of 260 
 
 
 
meaningful by ensuring accountability of the officer 
or authority in charge. 
35. The principle of accountability is considered as 
a cornerstone of the human rights framework.  It is 
a crucial feature that must govern the relationship 
between “duty bearers” in authority and “right 
holders” affected by their actions. Accountability of 
institutions is also one of the development goals 
adopted by the United Nations in 2015 and is also 
recognised as one of the six principles of the Citizens 
Charter Movement. 
36. Accountability has three essential constituent 
dimensions: (i) responsibility, (ii) answerability, and 
(iii) enforceability. Responsibility requires 
the 
identification of duties and performance obligations 
of individuals in authority and with authorities. 
Answerability requires reasoned decision making so 
that those affected by their decisions, including the 
public, are aware of the same. Enforceability 
requires appropriate corrective and remedial action 
against lack of responsibility and accountability to 
be taken. Accountability has a corrective function, 
making it possible to address individual or collective 
grievances. It enables action against officials or 
institutions for dereliction of duty. It also has a 
preventive function that helps to identify the 
procedure or policy which has become non-
functional and to improve upon it.” 
25. In India, environmental rule of law must draw 
attention to the existing legal regime, rules, processes, 
and norms that environmental regulatory institutions 
follow to achieve the goal of effective and good 
governance and implementation of environmental laws. 
More importantly, the focus must be on the policy and 
regulatory and implementation agencies. In doing so, 
environmental rule of law fosters open, accountable, and 
transparent 
decision 
making 
and 
participatory

governance. The renewed role of constitutional courts 
will be to undertake judicial review to ensure that 
institutions and regulatory bodies comply with the 
principles of environmental rule of law. 
x   x   x 
28. We may ask a simple question – how effectively are 
these environmental bodies functioning today? This 
question has a direct bearing on the protection and 
restoration of ecological balance. 
 
29. As environmental governance through these bodies 
emerges, the obligation of the constitutional courts is 
even greater. Hitherto, the constitutional courts focused 
on decisions and actions taken by the executive or 
private persons impacting the environment and ecology 
because the scrutiny by regulators was felt to be 
insufficient. Their judgment, review, and consideration 
did not inspire confidence and therefore, the Court took 
up the issue and would decide the case. In this process, 
a large number of decisions rendered by this Court on 
sensitive environmental, forest, and ecological matters 
constitute the critical mass of our environmental 
jurisprudence. This Court would continue to exercise 
judicial review, particularly in environmental matters, 
whenever necessary. 
 
30. We however seek to emphasise and reiterate the 
importance of ensuring the effective functioning of these 
environmental bodies as this is imperative for the 
protection, restitution, and development of the ecology. 
The role of the constitutional courts is therefore to 
monitor the proper institutionalisation of environmental 
regulatory bodies and authorities. 
 
31. In furtherance of the principles of environmental rule 
of law, the bodies, authorities, regulators, and executive  
offices entrusted with environmental duties must 
function with the following institutional features: 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 167 of 260 
 
 
 
 
i. The composition, qualifications, tenure, method of 
appointment and removal of the members of these 
authorities must be clearly laid down. Further, the 
appointments must be regularly made to ensure 
continuity and these bodies must be staffed with 
persons who have the requisite knowledge, technical 
expertise, and specialisation to ensure their efficient 
functioning. 
ii. The authorities and bodies must receive adequate 
funding and their finances must be certain and 
clear. 
iii. The mandate and role of each authority and body 
must be clearly demarcated so as to avoid overlap 
and duplication of work and the method for 
constructive coordination between institutions must 
be prescribed. 
iv. The authorities and bodies must notify and  make  
available the rules, regulations, and other guidelines 
and make them accessible by providing them on the 
website, including in regional languages, to the 
extent possible. If the authority or body does not 
have the power to frame rules or regulations, it may 
issue comprehensive guidelines in a standardised 
form and notify them rather than office memoranda. 
v. These bodies must clearly lay down the applicable 
rules and regulations in detail and the procedure for 
application, 
consideration, 
and 
grant 
of 
permissions, consent, and approvals. 
vi. The authorities and bodies must notify norms for 
public hearing, the process of decision-making, 
prescription of right to appeal, and timelines. 
vii. These bodies must prescribe the method of 
accountability by clearly indicating the allocation of 
duties and responsibilities of their officers.

viii. There must be regular and systematic audit of 
the functioning of these authorities. 
 
32. The role of the constitutional courts is to ensure that 
such environmental bodies function vibrantly, and are 
assisted by robust infrastructure and human resources. 
The constitutional courts will monitor the functioning of 
these institutions so that the environment and ecology 
is not only protected but also enriched. 
 
Constitutional Court and the Environmental Rule of Law: 
28. Before I proceed further in the matter, it would be necessary 
to know the role of the Constitutional Court in matters 
concerning science and technology and environment. The 
observations of this Court in the following cases are noted as 
under:  
(i)  On the aspect of the approach of the Constitutional Courts 
towards questions arising in the realm of science and 
environment, this Court has time and again struck a balance 
between exercising restraint and answering questions 
arising in the realm of pure science by, inter alia, placing 
reliance on the principle of sustainable development, 
precautionary principle and polluter pays principle. This 
Court has not only incorporated progressive ideals and 
frameworks to strengthen the process of sustainable 
development but has repeatedly emphasised the contours of 
its adjudication in concerns touching upon environment. 
However, growth of jurisprudence in environmental rule of 
law provides ample guidance for the present adjudication.

(ii)  In Hanuman Laxman Aroskar vs. Union of India, (2019) 
15 SCC 401 (“Hanuman Laxman Aroskar”), this Court 
recognised the need to imbue institutional decision-making 
on questions of environment with the central precepts of the 
rule of law to achieve the lofty goal of sustainable 
development. Placing reliance upon the United Nations 
Environment 
Programme’s 
First 
Global 
Report 
on 
Environmental Rule of Law, this Court articulated the 
following 
seven 
components 
of 
the 
framework 
of 
Environmental Rule of Law: 
i. 
Fair, clear, and implementable environmental laws; 
 
ii.  Access to information, public participation, and 
access 
to 
justice 
through 
courts, 
tribunals, 
commissions, and other bodies; 
 
iii. Accountability and integrity of decision-makers and 
institutions; 
 
iv. Clear and coordinated mandates and roles, across 
and within institutions; 
 
v. 
Accessible, fair, impartial, timely and responsive 
dispute resolution mechanisms; 
 
vi. Recognition of the mutually reinforcing relationship 
between rights and environmental rule of law; and 
 
vii. Specific 
criteria 
for 
the 
interpretation 
of 
environmental law. 
 
It 
further 
acknowledged 
how 
the 
contemporary 
environmental challenges such as the climate change crisis 
could be effectively addressed through a creative synergy of 
constitutional values of fairness, accountability and 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 170 of 260 
 
 
 
transparency with core ideals of environmental protection in 
the following words: 
“156. The rule of law requires a regime which has 
effective, accountable and transparent institutions. 
Responsive, 
inclusive, 
participatory 
and 
representative decision making are key ingredients 
to the rule of law. Public access to information is, in 
similar terms, fundamental to the preservation of 
the rule of law. In a domestic context, environmental 
governance that is founded on the rule of law 
emerges from the values of our Constitution. The 
health of the environment is key to preserving the 
right to life as a constitutionally recognised value 
under Article 21 of the Constitution. Proper 
structures for environmental decision making find 
expression in the guarantee against arbitrary action 
and the affirmative duty of fair treatment under 
Article 14 of the Constitution.” 
(iii)  The 
judgment 
in 
Himachal 
Pradesh 
Bus-Stand 
Management 
& 
Development 
Authority vs. Central 
Empowered Committee, (2021) 4 SCC 309 (“H.P. Bus-
Stand”) expanded the framework of environmental rule of 
law to include within it the State’s positive obligations to 
create conceptual, procedural and institutional structures 
that guide environmental regulation in furtherance of the 
environmental rule of law. Emphasising the critical need for 
multi-disciplinary perspectives, this Court held that: 
“49. The environmental rule of law, at a certain level, 
is a facet of the concept of the rule of law. But it 
includes specific features that are unique to 
environmental governance, features which are sui 
generis. The environmental rule of law seeks to 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 171 of 260 
 
 
 
create essential tools — conceptual, procedural and 
institutional to bring structure to the discourse on 
environmental protection. It does so to enhance our 
understanding of environmental challenges — of 
how they have been shaped by humanity's interface 
with nature in the past, how they continue to be 
affected by its engagement with nature in the 
present and the prospects for the future, if we were 
not to radically alter the course of destruction which 
humanity's actions have charted. The environmental 
rule of law seeks to facilitate a multi-disciplinary 
analysis of the nature and consequences of carbon 
footprints and in doing so it brings a shared 
understanding 
between 
science, 
regulatory 
decisions and policy perspectives in the field of 
environmental protection. It recognises that the 
“law” element in the environmental rule of law does 
not make the concept peculiarly the preserve of 
lawyers and Judges. On the contrary, it seeks to 
draw within the fold all stakeholders in formulating 
strategies to deal with current challenges posed by 
environmental degradation, climate change and the 
destruction of habitats. The environmental rule of 
law seeks a unified understanding of these concepts. 
There are significant linkages between concepts 
such as sustainable development, the polluter pays 
principle and the trust doctrine. The universe of 
nature is indivisible and integrated. The state of the 
environment in one part of the earth affects and is 
fundamentally affected by what occurs in another 
part. Every element of the environment shares a 
symbiotic relationship with the others. It is this 
inseparable 
bond 
and 
connect 
which 
the 
environmental rule of law seeks to explore and 
understand in order to find solutions to the pressing 
problems 
which 
threaten 
the 
existence 
of 
humanity. The environmental rule of law is founded 
on the need to understand the consequences of our 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 172 of 260 
 
 
 
actions going beyond local, State and national 
boundaries. The rise in the oceans threatens not just 
maritime communities. The rise in temperatures, 
dilution of glaciers and growing desertification have 
consequences which go beyond the communities 
and creatures whose habitats are threatened. They 
affect the future survival of the entire ecosystem. The 
environmental rule of law attempts to weave an 
understanding of the connections in the natural 
environment which make the issue of survival a 
unified challenge which confronts human societies 
everywhere. It seeks to build on experiential 
learnings of the past to formulate principles which 
must become the building pillars of environmental 
regulation 
in 
the 
present 
and 
future. 
The 
environmental rule of law recognises the overlap 
between 
and 
seeks 
to 
amalgamate 
scientific 
learning, legal principle and policy intervention. 
Significantly, it brings attention to the rules, 
processes and norms followed by institutions which 
provide regulatory governance on the environment. 
In doing so, it fosters a regime of open, accountable 
and transparent decision making on concerns of the 
environment. 
It 
fosters 
the 
importance 
of 
participatory governance — of the value in giving a 
voice 
to 
those 
who 
are 
most 
affected 
by 
environmental policies and public projects. The 
structural design of the environmental rule of law 
composes 
of 
substantive, 
procedural 
and 
institutional elements. The tools of analysis go 
beyond legal concepts. The result of the framework 
is more than just the sum total of its parts. Together, 
the elements which it embodies aspire to safeguard 
the bounties of nature against existential threats. 
For it is founded on the universal recognition that 
the future of human existence depends on how we 
conserve, protect and regenerate the environment 
today.”

This Court distilled the challenges that confront a 
constitutional court in using the framework of an environmental 
rule of law. Noting the often-intractable problem of adjudicating 
environmental infractions in the absence of precise, quantifiable 
and concrete evidence, this Court appreciated the valuable 
principled guidance rendered by environmental rule of law in the 
following words:  
“54. … The point, therefore, is simply this — the 
environmental rule of law calls on us, as Judges, to 
marshal the knowledge emerging from the record, 
limited though it may sometimes be, to respond in a 
stern and decisive fashion to violations of environmental 
law. We cannot be stupefied into inaction by not having 
access to complete details about the manner in which an 
environmental law violation has occurred or its full 
implications. Instead, the framework, acknowledging the 
imperfect world that we inhabit, provides a roadmap to 
deal with environmental law violations, an absence of 
clear evidence of consequences notwithstanding.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
Public Trust Doctrine: 
29. At this stage, I shall refer to certain observations made by 
this Court in the context of preservation of environment and on 
public trust doctrine. According to this Court, all environment-
related developmental activities should benefit more people while 
maintaining the environmental balance. This could be ensured 
only by strict adherence to sustainable development, without 
which the lives of the coming generations will be in jeopardy. In 
M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India, (1991) 2 SCC 353, it was 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 174 of 260 
 
 
 
observed that law alone also cannot help in restoring a balance 
in the biospheric disturbance. Nor can funds help effectively. The 
situation requires a clear perception and imaginative planning. 
It also requires sustained effort and result oriented strategic 
action. 
 
30. This Court’s jurisprudence on the right to a safe and 
healthy environment is a firewall against unscrupulous and 
unsustainable decision-making. It encapsulates a concomitant 
duty for the State, as understood in light of Articles 48 and 51A(g) 
of the Constitution of India. In Charan Lal Sahu vs. Union of 
India, (1990) 1 SCC 613 (“Charan Lal Sahu”) and Subhash 
Kumar vs. State of Bihar, (1991) 1 SCC 598 (“Subhash 
Kumar”), this Court expressly observed that Article 21 includes 
the right of enjoyment of pollution-free water and air. Virender 
Gaur vs. State of Haryana, (1995) 2 SCC 577 (“Virender 
Gaur”) expanded the scope of the right to the effect that a 
hygienic environment is an integral facet of the right to a healthy 
life. The right was so construed in terms of the State’s duty under 
Articles 48 and 51A(g) to forge policies to maintain ecological 
balance by taking concrete measures to ‘promote, protect and 
improve’ the environment. 
 
30.1 Thereafter, in M.C. Mehta vs. Kamal Nath, (2000) 6 SCC 
213 (“Kamal Nath”), it was expounded that the fundamental

such as air, water and soil. This Court articulated the positive 
duties of the State to take all necessary measures for the 
protection and promotion of the environment under the EP Act, 
1986 in Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action vs. Union of 
India, (1996) 3 SCC 212 (“Enviro-Legal Action”). It was also 
held that if the Central Government omits to fulfil any of its 
duties under the Sections 3 and 5 of the EP Act, 1986, this Court 
could issue appropriate directions to it to take necessary 
measures.  
 
30.2 Therefore, the right to a safe and healthy environment 
encompasses a corresponding duty on the State to faithfully 
implement the environmental statutes and take all necessary 
measures.  
 
30.3 The substantive concern of the right to environmental 
protection now also encompasses the adverse effects of climate 
change. This Court, speaking through Hon’ble Dr. Justice D.Y. 
Chandrachud in M.K. Ranjitsinh vs. Union of India, 2024 (4) 
Scale 779 : 2024 INSC 280 (“M.K. Ranjitsinh”) has explicitly 
recognised that adverse environmental consequences, such as 
sea level rise, have a disproportionate impact on socially, 
geographically and economically marginalised classes of citizens. 
 
30.4 The aforesaid elucidation of the right to a safe and healthy 
environment and the concept of environmental rule of law as 
applied in the Indian jurisprudential context reveals that the 
concept is one of the ways of embedding a consciousness about 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 176 of 260 
 
 
 
adverse effects on the environment into the sub-structure of the 
legal framework to inform an environment-protecting legal 
reasoning. Therefore, environmental legislation such as the EP 
Act, 1986 and the 1989 Rules ought to be interpreted so as not 
to infringe the fundamental right to a safe and healthy 
environment under Article 21. Where there is a choice of 
statutory construction, this Court would be bound to proffer an 
interpretation that effectively protects the right to a safe and 
healthy environment.  
 
Precautionary Principle: 
31.   The essence of the precautionary principle lies in the notion 
that ‘decision makers should act in advance of scientific certainty 
to protect the environment.’ [Source: Andrew Jordan and 
Timothy 
O’ 
Riordan, 
‘The 
Precautionary 
Principle 
in 
Contemporary Environmental Politics’ (1995) 4(3) Environmental 
Values 191, 194]. The adoption of the precautionary principle 
reflects a paradigm shift from the traditional reactive approach, 
wherein the environmental regulator responded to apparent 
environmental hazards. It is a significant shift even from the 
preventive approach that sought to prevent the environmental 
damage arising from risks that are bound to actualize in the 
foreseeable future. On the other hand, the precautionary 
principle seeks to avoid such future environmental damage 
which may arise from uncertain eventualities. In other words, 
the 
precautionary 
principle 
mandates 
cautiously 
taking 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 177 of 260 
 
 
 
appropriate measures to identify potentially harmful activities 
even in the face of scientific uncertainty. Precaution, in other 
words, is the expression of a well-founded fear of the unknown 
and the unknowable environmental consequences of certain 
human actions. For a fear to be well-founded, it must emerge 
from 
a 
robust 
risk 
analysis 
of 
potentially 
hazardous 
consequences for environmental health. 
 
32.   The 1982 World Charter for Nature first articulated the idea 
of the precautionary principle in General Principle 11, which 
postulates the control of activities which might have an impact 
on nature and the use of the best available technologies that 
minimize significant risks to nature or other adverse effects. The 
General Principle 11 recommends a graded approach to varying 
levels of environmental risks and damage, while instantiating 
that: 
i.  those activities which are likely to cause irreversible damage 
to nature shall be avoided; 
ii.  those activities which cause a significant risk to nature shall 
only be permitted upon exhaustive examination if the 
proponents of such activities would demonstrate that the 
expected benefits outweigh the potential damage to nature; 
and 
iii.  those activities which cause a significant risk to nature but 
where the potential adverse effects are not fully understood 
should not be proceeded with; 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 178 of 260 
 
 
 
 
iv.  those activities which may disturb nature shall be proceeded 
only upon ex-ante assessment of their consequences through 
environmental impact studies and requisite planning to 
minimize potential adverse effects. 
 
32.1  Thereafter, the principle was enshrined in Principle 15 of 
the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 1992, 
which states: 
“In order to protect the environment, the precautionary 
approach shall be widely applied by States according to 
their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or 
irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall 
not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective 
measures to prevent environmental degradation.” 
 
32.2  It also finds expression in Article 10(6) of the CPB to the 
CBD, which states that: 
“6. Lack of scientific certainty due to insufficient relevant 
scientific information and knowledge regarding the 
extent of the potential adverse effects of a living modified 
organism on the conservation and sustainable use of 
biological diversity in the Party of import, taking also into 
account risks to human health, shall not prevent that 
Party from taking a decision, as appropriate, with regard 
to the import of the living modified organism in question 
as referred to in paragraph 3 above, in order to avoid or 
minimize such potential adverse effects.” 
 
32.3  While Section 20 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 
exhorts the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to take precaution 
into account in passing orders, this Court’s jurisprudence, as 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 179 of 260 
 
 
 
explained below, had long recognized and deepened the 
precautionary principle. 
 
33.   This Court in the following cases has discussed at length 
the precautionary principle, which are adverted to at this stage. 
(i)  In Vellore Citizens’ Welfare Forum vs. Union of India, 
(1996) 5 SCC 647 (“Vellore Citizens”), this Court was 
seized of a Writ Petition filed by a citizens’ group to seek 
enforcement of the provisions of the Water (Prevention and 
Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 against tanneries that were 
discharging untreated effluent into nearby lands. While 
directing strict enforcement of environmental law and 
holding the authorities accountable for their failure to 
exercise statutory powers, this Court expounded on the 
significance of the precautionary principle. It traced the 
origins of the precautionary principle in international law 
and located the same in domestic environmental law. This 
Court’s 
formulation 
of 
the 
precautionary 
principle 
constitutes three propositions: 
i.  The environmental measures undertaken by the 
State Government and the statutory authorities 
must anticipate, prevent and attack the causes of 
environmental degradation. 
ii.  Where there are threats of serious and irreversible 
damage, lack of scientific certainty should not be 
used as a reason for postponing measures to 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 180 of 260 
 
 
 
prevent environmental degradation. 
iii.  The reversal of the “burden of proof” to the 
proponent of a potentially hazardous activity 
which could disrupt the natural environment was 
critical for ecologically balanced and sustainable 
development. 
 
This Court construed the precautionary principle in light 
of Articles 47, 48A and 51A(g) of the Constitution. Further, 
it was concluded that the extant legislative framework, 
specifically the EP Act, 1986, included the application of the 
precautionary principle in addition to the polluter pays 
principle. Consequently, this Court passed a direction to the 
authority to be appointed under Section 3(3) of the EP Act, 
1986 to implement the ‘precautionary principle.’ 
(ii)  The precautionary principle was explained in greater detail 
by this Court in A.P. Pollution Control Board vs. Prof. M.V. 
Nayudu, (1999) 2 SCC 718 (“A.P. Pollution Control 
Board”) from the lens of international environmental law. 
Here, this Court was considering whether the establishment 
of a hazardous industry could be countenanced within ten 
kilometre of reservoirs used for drinking water. This Court 
noted that the “assimilative capacity” rule was embedded in 
Principle 6 of the Stockholm Declaration of the U.N. 
Conference 
on 
Human 
Environment, 
1972. 
This 
“assimilative capacity” principle was premised on the 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 181 of 260 
 
 
 
assumption of perfect scientific predictability that would 
allow the internalisation of ecological risks within industrial 
processes. It was reasoned that the preponderance of 
unpredictability of adverse environmental effects led to the 
adoption of the 11th Principle of the U.N. General Assembly 
Resolution on World Charter for Nature, 1982, and the 
Principle 15 of the Rio Conference of 1992. 
 Quite axiomatically, precautionary principle changes 
the role and significance of scientific data in environmental 
disputes. Once a threat to the environment has been 
identified, action should be taken to abate environmental 
interference, even though there may be scientific uncertainty 
as to the effects of the activities. [Source: Lavanya Rajamani, 
‘The precautionary principle’ in Shibani Ghosh (ed.) Indian 
Environmental Law (Orient Blackswan, 1994]. Certain 
anticipated 
environmental 
harms 
and 
available 
environmental data may warrant a strong and strict 
application, i.e., the potentially hazardous activity is banned 
until the proponent of the activity demonstrates that it poses 
no (or acceptable) risk. In such a case, the burden to prove 
the acceptable standard of risk shifts to the proponent of 
such an activity. In this context, reliance was placed upon 
an article authored by Charmian Barton, in Volume 22 of 
Harvard Environmental Law Review (1998) and inferred that 
the environmental decision-makers must acknowledge the 
inadequacy of information about environmental risks and 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 182 of 260 
 
 
 
‘err on the side of caution’ to prevent serious and irreversible 
harm. 
(iii) In M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India, (2004) 12 SCC 118 
(“M.C. Mehta”), this Court advanced the view that the 
precautionary principle enjoined the State to take affirmative 
action to prevent environmental harm, even when the nature 
and extent of such harm could not be anticipated with 
scientific precision and certainty. It was reasoned that when 
it was difficult to strike a balance between the protection of 
the environment and economic development due to 
prevailing uncertainty and lack of direct evidence of actual 
harm, reasonable suspicion of harm would be adequate to 
press the precautionary principle into service and take 
anticipatory action.

Action Taken Report 
8. 
Assessment of threats and 
adverse effects of GM crops in 
foreign countries should not 
be mechanically transplanted 
by agencies. The Government 
agencies conduct indigenous 
studies to substantiate their 
claim that there is no threat 
posed to our environment on 
account of GM crops. Any 
study that conducts impact 
assessment should be funded 
by DBT for sheer credibility. 
Similar 
to 
other 
regulatory processes, the 
developer/applicant 
furnishes studies about 
safety 
assessment 
of 
crops. In case of DMH-
11, developed by Delhi 
University, 
all 
studies 
have been funded by 
DBT. 
9. 
The 
hasty 
decision 
to 
commercialise 
GM 
crops 
should be reconsidered in 
light of lack of scientific 
evidence about chronic and 
transgenerational impact of 
such crops.  
There is no scientific 
evidence to justify the 
need for such studies as 
there 
exists 
no 
biologically 
relevant 
difference between GM 
crops and their non-GM 
counterparts. 
 
36.  I have perused and discussed the contents of the PSC 
Reports, their recommendations of critical import to the 
regulatory framework as well as the action taken and observe on 
the following aspects:  
I. Thorough Probe into Bt Brinjal Approval: Although the Report 
of the PSC, 2012, had recommended that the MoEF&CC 
should conduct a thorough probe into the concerns raised 
by 
Dr. 
P.M. 
Bhargava 
regarding 
the 
approval 
for 
commercialisation of Bt brinjal till the imposition of the 
moratorium on 09.02.2010, the Action Taken Report does 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 188 of 260 
 
 
 
not point to the particulars of any enquiry or investigation. 
It appears that the justification offered by the erstwhile Co-
Chairman, GEAC, Prof. Reddy, has been accepted without a 
fair and comprehensive investigation. 
II. Institutional Architecture of GEAC: Although both the PSC 
Reports 
recommended 
reforms 
in 
the 
institutional 
architecture of GEAC, by way of having a full-time body with 
a leadership that is competent to conduct impartial and 
sound scrutiny of applications for approval under the 1989 
Rules, the Action Taken Report denies the very need for such 
reforms. I infer that the Government is reluctant to reform 
the composition and criteria for appointment to GEAC. No 
response is forthcoming on the PSC’s recommendation that 
the conflict of interest in the composition, caused by the 
presence of a nominee of DBT, should be minimised. This 
accentuates the concern about the lack of indigenous and 
independent research institutions. 
III. Labelling and Regulation of GM Foods: The Action Taken 
Report does not address the question of labelling of GM foods 
under Section 23 of the FSSA, 2006. There is inadequate 
clarity about the issuance of the notification under Section 
22 for regulating sale, distribution and consumption of GM 
food. 
IV. Legislation: With respect to the recommendation to initiate 
the process of consultation to enact a comprehensive 
legislation on regulation of biotechnology, I note that the 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 189 of 260 
 
 
 
Action Taken Report refers to the Biotechnology Regulatory 
Authority of India, 2013 (“BRAI Bill, 2013”). On 28.08.2013, 
this Court noted that Sri K.K. Venugopal, learned senior 
counsel, appearing for one of the contesting respondents had 
informed that the Central Government has prepared a Bill 
bearing Bill No.57 of 2013, which is named the BRAI Bill, 
2013. However, this Bill lapsed at the end of the 15th Lok 
Sabha. Therefore, there is no statutory regulatory framework 
in the form of a Parliamentary law that is in place. The 1989 
Rules govern the existing procedure which are in fact 
subordinate legislation, which is contented to be inadequate. 
V. Impact on Agricultural Ecosystem: The blanket denial of 
adverse ecological effects by way of cross-pollination or 
otherwise is mostly on the basis of research conducted in 
foreign contexts. This may not at all be relevant in the Indian 
context and ecosystem. The PSC has rightly observed that 
the role of non-target organisms and beneficial organisms is 
critical to the agricultural ecosystem.  
 
37. My understanding is that GM crops are those crops whose 
genomes have been modified by the insertion of usually foreign 
(for example, bacterial) genes through rDNA technology. Such 
modification serves to incorporate traits into plants that are 
either absent or rare in their domesticated and/or wild varieties. 
For instance, Bt cotton is cotton modified with a set of genes (or 
a gene construct) that codes for the Bt toxin. Bt toxin acts as an

insecticide against pink and American bollworms. This specific 
insecticidal trait is absent in wild as well as domesticated 
varieties of cotton.  
 
38. According 
to 
the 
petitioners, 
two 
traits 
dominate 
commercialized GM crops - HT (47 percent of the acreage), and 
insect resistance or Bt (12 percent). Another 41 percent is under 
stacked traits, i.e., both HT and Bt HT crops that obviate manual 
weeding and one can simply spray the corresponding herbicide 
(glyphosate, glufosinate, and dicamba) on the entire field, and 
everything other than the HT crop will perish. In theory, the Bt 
crop reduces the applications of external insecticides. Thus, 
most of the GM crops commercialized globally, in particular HT 
and stacked crops, are tailored for the routines of capital-
intensive agriculture, i.e., agriculture that relies on monoculture 
(rather than mixed and intercropping), purchased seeds, fossil 
fuels, and intensive applications of synthetic chemicals which in 
effect is not sustainable in the long run.  
 
39. In my view, the controversy in these writ petitions converges 
upon 
a 
foundational 
aspect, 
which 
is, 
the 
extent 
of 
implementation of the recommendations of the TEC constituted 
by this Court. Only upon considering this foundational aspect 
can I proceed to determine the points for consideration. I cannot 
ignore the TEC Report as suggested by learned Attorney General, 
for it would result in undermining the earlier orders of this Court, 
which would be an improper approach in the matter. 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 191 of 260 
 
 
 
 
39.1 The subject matter of this case is indeed technical, as it 
involves scrutinising the adoption of a technology that would 
enable the modification of genomes through the insertion of 
foreign genes. The aim of the modification is often to craft hybrid 
varieties that have certain desirable characteristics from the 
point of view of agricultural productivity, sustainability and 
resilience.  
 
40.  At the outset, learned Attorney General submitted that the 
TEC Report submitted to this Court goes beyond the terms of 
reference to the extent of observing that HT crops are completely 
unsuitable in the Indian context which is not just and proper. 
Dr. Paroda, also a member of TEC, has filed a separate report 
raising objections to the TEC report submitted by the majority of 
the members which could be considered by this Court. 
 
40.1  In the backdrop of identifying the actual controversy in 
these matters, at the outset, the terms of reference of TEC, inter 
alia, could be revisited as follows: 
(i)  to review and recommend the nature of sequencing of risk 
assessment (environment and health safety) vis-à-vis all GM 
crops before they are released into the environment;  
(ii)  to recommend the point at which environmental release 
through open-field trials can be permitted;  
(iii)  to advise whether GE crops or plants could be replicated 
under different agro-ecological regions and different seasons 
as compared to greenhouse conditions;  

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 192 of 260 
 
 
 
(iv)  to advise measures or safeguards required to prevent 
potential risks to the environment vis-à-vis open-field trials 
and to recommend protocols necessary to preclude any 
escaped material from causing an adverse effect on the 
environment;  
(v)  to advise whether in India, there are state-of-the-art testing 
facilities and professional expertise available to conduct 
various biosafety tests and if not, recommend setting up an 
independent testing laboratory and institutions.  
 
40.2 An interim report, and thereafter, a final report were 
submitted by the TEC. As already noted, the final report was in 
two parts: the first part of the report was by a majority of five 
members of the TEC and a separate note was submitted by Dr. 
R.S. Paroda. Since the views of the majority and the separate 
note have been recorded hereinabove, I would only discuss 
whether the TEC did indeed breach the terms of reference. 
 
40.3 A perusal of the terms of the reference reveals an emphasis 
on four aspects: sequencing; scientific tenability; adequacy of 
regulatory conditions and availability of technological facilities. 
The direction of this Court regarding the interim report was 
specifically to seek recommendations on the desirability of a 
partial or complete ban on open-field tests and what biosafety 
protocol ought to be followed and under what conditions. 
 
40.4 It is clear that the terms of reference relate to this Court’s 
concern about the regulatory conditions for the release of GMO 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 193 of 260 
 
 
 
crops and the existence, or otherwise, of any gaps in the same. 
It is discernable that the final recommendations responded to 
these queries regarding the adequacy of regulatory conditions, 
biosafety protocols and available technological framework, by 
recommending various measures to fill the gaps that existed in 
the regulatory regime at a general level. The first gap, as I 
understand is that of technical expertise. The TEC inter alia, 
recommended as under: 
(i) Constitution of sub-committees with domain expertise in the 
fields 
of 
health, 
environment, 
agro-economics 
and 
socioeconomics, molecular biology, etc. which could replace 
the single committee structure devised by the 1989 Rules.  
(ii)  Another recommendation pointed to the elimination of 
conflict of interest, earmarking of specific sites for field trials 
and stakeholder participation.  
(iii)  It also stated that there is a need to develop consultation, 
collaboration and capacity building, and that the Indian 
regulatory system must develop the ability to assess as to 
how any GM product is likely to impact different sections of 
the society.  
Therefore, having regard to the discussion made by it, I find 
that the TEC did not breach its Terms of Reference. 
 
41. The petitioners herein have sought for implementation of 
the aforesaid recommendations of the majority by contending 
that the question of the consequences of transgenic mustard

hybrid DMH-11 being an HT crop remains unanswered. This is 
because the Union of India, in its additional affidavit dated 
09.11.2022, has acknowledged that transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11 possesses HT characteristics. Yet, the Union of India 
asserts that it cannot be officially labelled as such and therefore, 
it should not be referred to as HT corp. That transgenic mustard 
hybrid DMH-11 has never been tested as a HT crop because India 
does not have any regulatory guidelines and protocols for testing 
of HT crops, is the contention of the petitioners. 
 
41.1 The petitioners have further countered the stand of the 
Union of India by submitting as under:  
(i)  “… that the presence of third HT gene (Bar) is essential for 
hybrid seed production”, according to the Union of India. The 
presence of HT gene (Bar) makes DMH-11 an HT crop. This 
is also the finding of the PSC Reports which have stated that 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 is a HT crop. There is 
clear evidence on the adverse impacts of environmental 
release of DMH-11, which is a HT crop in various writings 
which have been ignored by GEAC; 
(ii)  that the Union of India is silent as to the measures 
undertaken 
to 
ensure 
non-contamination, 
in 
case 
environmental release of GMOs is permitted, as irreversible 
risk of contamination on human health is enormous;  

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 195 of 260 
 
 
 
(iii)  that the Union of India is also silent on the liability of the 
applicant for potential losses to farmers and consumers on 
account of irreversible contamination; 
(iv)  that glufosinate is banned for all other uses except for tea 
plantations and is specifically banned for use on DMH-11 by 
farmers. This is because of the acute toxicity and health 
concerns. That, long term studies would show the adverse 
effects of glufosinate which may not show up in short term 
studies. Hence, it is necessary to have adequate studies on 
the use of glufosinate on plants; 
(v) that GEAC has failed to deal with illegal plantation of Bt 
cotton and the same is being grown in the country illegally 
on commercial basis. That organisations such as Shetkari 
Sangathan have been encouraging farmers to do illegal 
planting of Bt brinjal, which GEAC as a regulator has failed 
to check; 
(vi) that there is a failure to undertake any socio-economic risk 
analysis by GEAC with regard to the failure of Bt cotton in 
accordance with the CBD and the CPB. The need for such an 
assessment was also highlighted by TEC in its report. Such 
an assessment was required because farmers across the 
country have been financially burdened due to the 
increasing prices of Bt cotton seeds and they have to spend 
on pesticides and other resources to make the crops more 
pest-resistant and high-yielding. This has resulted in 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 196 of 260 
 
 
 
escalated expenses and has reduced the margin of profit for 
the farmers; 
(vii) that the pink bollworm, a major pest to the cotton crop, has 
developed resistance in last few years which has worried the 
farmers who have sown Bt cotton seeds. Therefore, cotton 
yields were stagnant in the last five years due to the fact that 
the technology was used for yield improvement but not for 
loss prevention; 
(viii)that large quantities of GM processed oil is being imported 
in the form of canola oil and soyabean oil, which is in 
violation of the constitutional and legal rights of the citizens 
under Articles 21 and 14 of the Constitution. That GEAC, in 
their communication dated 23.02.2018 addressed to the 
DGFT, had informed that it had not authorised or approved 
GM soyabean or any other product derived from GM 
soyabean seeds for import or cultivation in India. If that is 
so, as to how, subsequently, GM food is being imported to 
India is not known; 
(ix) that the Union of India is silent about the measures 
undertaken in respect of labelling of GM foods, as there are 
no studies which have been commissioned as regards the 
consumption of GM foods.  
 
41.2 The petitioners have contended that there is a need for 
formulation of a national policy of GM crops for the following 
reasons:  

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 197 of 260 
 
 
 
(i) that apart from South Western China, North Western 
Himalayas constitute an important centre where there is 
enormous diversity in Brassica Juncea forms. Therefore, 
there are two geographical races of Brassica Juncea, the 
Chinese pool and the Indian pool. The share of holding by 
the Chinese pool is 17 per cent and by the Indian pool is 15 
per cent; 
(ii) that the growth of GM crops in India would impact organic 
food producers having regard to the difficulties in 
segregation of GM and non-GM foods. This would have an 
adverse effect on export of organic food as importers would 
closely examine the conditions under which organic food is 
being grown and any concerns about contamination could 
lead to an adverse impact and loss of markets for organic 
food producers; 
(iii) that India is a signatory to the CPB, therefore, a duty is cast 
on the Government to assess the impact of its policies and 
minimize adverse impacts of the same vide Article 26 thereof. 
(iv) that the 1989 Rules were framed prior to the coming into 
force of the CPB but there is a distinct inconsistency between 
the same and therefore, the 1989 Rules should be amended 
in line with the said protocol, otherwise, international law 
could be applied as part of the national law, unless it is in 
conflict with any Act of Parliament. 
(v) In sum and substance, it was contended that there is a need 
for putting in place a suitable policy and an effective 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 198 of 260 
 
 
 
regulatory mechanism which would work within the 
framework of its mandate.  
 
41.3 Per contra, the Union of India urged this Court to not 
intervene in the matter as the questions involved are highly 
technical and polycentric in character. This proposition is indeed 
attractive at a first blush, for it invites the Court to trust the 
process of the grant of approval for the environmental release of 
GMOs under the applicable legal regime. But, it is settled law 
that expert opinion is not beyond the pale of judicial review, 
especially when there are serious infirmities in the decision-
making process, vide Institute of Chartered Financial 
Analysts of India vs. Council of The Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India, (2007) 12 SCC 210 (“Institute of 
Chartered Financial Analysts of India”). 
 
41.4 In the above backdrop, the points for consideration shall be 
answered. 
 
Re: Point No.1: Whether GEAC approval dated 18.10.2022 
and the consequent decision dated 25.10.2022 for the 
environmental release of DMH-11 is in accordance with 
law? 
 
42. I have adverted to in detail several meetings of GEAC held 
with regard to the application submitted by the applicant, 
namely, CGMCP, University of Delhi (South Campus) on 
15.09.2015 seeking approval for environmental release of the GE 
mustard hybrid DMH-11. This was after conclusion of the closed 
or confined trials and was accompanied with a dossier of 3285

pages compiling the results of the food and environmental safety 
studies that were carried out at the time of the confined trials for 
the environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-
11, parental lines bn 3.6 and modbs 2.99 containing barnase, 
barstar and bar genes. In the 125th meeting held on 11.12.2015, 
GEAC requested the applicant to give a presentation and 
thereafter on 04.01.2016, a sub-committee was constituted for 
examination of the dossier.  
 
42.1 The sub-committee held two meetings. After the first 
meeting, it recommended revision of the biosafety dossier by 
incorporating additional information regarding certain lacunae 
or gaps which it had identified and were also identified by the 
BSU. GEAC decided that if the biosafety dossier is found to be 
complete in all respects, then the same excluding confidential 
information, could be put in the public domain for comments. 
After the first sub-committee meeting, several submissions and 
recommendations were made which are detailed above. 
Thereafter, the second sub-committee meeting was held and the 
sub-committee sought time to analyse and review the revised 
dossier and results obtained in 129th GEAC meeting held on 
20.06.2016. The sub-committee suggested that the AFES report, 
prepared upon evaluation of biosafety data, be placed on the 
MoEF&CC website for thirty days to invite comments from 
stakeholders and the dossier also be made available in GEAC 
Secretariat for any person interested in studying the same. A

total of 759 comments were received between 05.09.2016 and 
05.10.2016 and 29 persons personally inspected the dossier at 
the premises of the MoEF&CC and provided their comments. 
However, the dossier was not put up on the website of GEAC. 
This is in fact a violation of the order of this Court dated 
08.04.2008 in respect of which contempt petition has been filed. 
 
42.2 On 07.10.2016, this Court recorded the submission of the 
Union of India that no release of GMOs shall take place till 
17.10.2016 because the Government had sought views from the 
public and upon receipt of such views and objections, the matter 
was to be considered by a Committee of experts, which process 
could not be completed by 17.10.2016. However on 11.05.2017, 
GEAC, in its 133rd Meeting, made the recommendation for the 
commercial release of DMH-11. However, on 31.07.2017, this 
Court recorded the submission of the Union of India that the 
Government has not yet taken a final decision, whether or not to 
permit the plantation of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11, and 
a final decision with reference to the approval would be taken by 
the Government in September, 2017. It was also pointed out that 
the plantation is likely to commence in October 2017. At a 
subsequent hearing on 22.11.2017, this Court recorded the 
Union of India’s submission that the Government of India had 
not yet taken a decision in the matter and that all the 
representations of the stakeholders would be considered before 
taking the final decision.

42.3 Thereafter, in its 136th Meeting on 20.09.2018, GEAC re-
examined the matter in light of the representations received and 
on a detailed discussion, agreed that the applicant may be 
advised to undertake field demonstration on transgenic mustard 
hybrid DMH-11 in an area of five acres at two to three different 
locations with a view to generate additional data on honeybees 
and other pollinators and on soil microbial diversity. Thereafter, 
in the 137th GEAC meeting held on 20.03.2019, there was a 
deferment of field demonstration studies on transgenic mustard 
during the year 2018-19 and it was extended for the seasons 
2019-20 and 2020-21. Thus, it is significant to note that GEAC 
itself had deferred field demonstration studies on transgenic 
mustard and this was in supersession of the earlier decision 
taken on 20.09.2018 in the 136th meeting of GEAC wherein the 
applicant was advised to undertake field demonstration in an 
area of five acres at two to three different locations. Therefore, till 
the year 2020-2021, the stage of field demonstration within an 
area of five acres at two or three different locations had not yet 
been cleared by GEAC with regard to transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11. 
 
42.4 When the matter stood thus, Prof. Deepak Pental, on behalf 
of CGMCP, Delhi University (South Campus), the applicant, vide 
his letter dated 10.05.2022, wrote directly to the Hon’ble Minister 
for Environment, Forest and Climate Change seeking acceptance 
of the recommendations for environmental release of transgenic

Subject: Request for environmental release of GE mustard 
Respected Minister, 
I am writing to you on the environmental release of the 
Genetic Engineering-based technology for hybrid seed 
production in mustard, a major oilseed crop of our 
country. Some recent positive, as well as negative 
developments, have induced me to write to you on the 
matter which is pending with MoEFCC.  
The positive development is the Union Governments’ 
decision to put SDN-1 and SDN-2 types of gene edited 
crops out of the biosafety regimes stipulated for the 
Generally Engineered (GE) crops. This is indeed a major 
step forward. Barring the EU, most of the development 
countries have already reduced biosafety requirements for 
genome-edited crops. The negative development is 
continuing stagnation of the edible oil sector in India. 
While the demand for edible oils is increasing globally, the 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 203 of 260 
 
 
 
supplies are under stress leading to a spurt in the prices 
of edible oils in the international markets. As our country 
imports more than fifty per cent of its edible oil 
requirement there is an urgency to increase our domestic 
production.  
Our group at the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop 
Plants (CGMCP), University of Delhi South Campus has 
been working on increasing the yield of mustard for the 
past 30 years. A report on the research work being caried 
out at the Centre is being attached  with this letter. The 
most appropriate technology for yield increase in mustard 
is hybrid breeding for which a robust hybrid seed 
production system is foundational; our GE-based hybrid 
seed production system meets the need. I believe the time 
has come for MoEFCC to permit environmental release of 
the GE technology for hybrid seed production to increase 
edible oil production in the country.  
To brief you on the past developments, the biosafety 
studies on the transgenic parental lines Varuna bn 3.6 and 
EH2 modbs 2.99 and the first generation hybrid DMH-11 
were initiated in the year 2010. All the stipulated biosafety 
studies including field testing under isolation were carried 
out and a 3251-page dossier was submitted to GEAC on 
September 15, 2015. The biosafety studies were supported 
by public funding of around Rs.8 crores. The GEAC in its 
133rd meeting held on May 11, 2017, recommended the 
environmental release of the parental lines and the first 
generation hybrid DMH-11 and permitted the development 
of a new generation of hybrids. Unfortunately, a few days 
later the MoEFCC website displayed the Ministry’s 
decision – ‘matters related to environmental release of 
Mustard transgenic are kept pending for further review’. 
Later in communication from GEAC, some additional 
experiments on honey bees were sought but no efforts were 
made to facilitate the execution of those experiments. We 
pointed out to GEAC that such tests were not required.

The technology we have used for hybrid seed production 
in mustard was first deployed in rapeseed, a sister crop of 
mustard – in 1996 in Canada, in 2002 in the USA, and in 
2003 in Australia. Rapeseed hybrids developed using the 
GE technologies are currently being cultivated in Canada 
on almost 9-10 million hectares. No untoward effect of GE 
rapeseed has been reported either from Canada or from 
USA and Australia. Canada is a big exporter of rapeseed 
oil and meal to all parts of the world as well as honey. 
There is no record of any harm to apiculture in Canada or 
from any other country that has released the GE hybrid 
seed production system.  
The point I want to make for your kind consideration is 
that the GE technology for hybrid seed production 
developed by us for mustard is well tested, has been used 
for more than 20 years in rapeseed, and over and above – 
we have carried out all the necessary biosafety tests on the 
transgenic mustard lines.  
I 
request 
that 
the 
MoEFCC 
may 
accept 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
133rd 
meeting 
of 
GEAC 
recommending the environmental release of the GE-based 
technology for hybrid seed production in mustard. If 
required, GEAC could meet again. We would be very happy 
to interact with GEAC to resolve any lingering doubts or 
questions.  
I would be most grateful for your kind help in resolving the 
issue of the environmental release of GE-based hybrid 
seed production technology.  
With kind regards, 
Yours sincerely,

comments were sought from the DBT, DARE and ICAR. On 
25.08.2022, the applicant once again made a presentation of the 
proposal for environmental release of DMH-11 to GEAC at its 
146th meeting. At that meeting, GEAC once again constituted 
another Expert Committee to examine the request letter dated 
10.05.2022 with respect to availability of adequate evidence 
about impact of transgenic mustard on honeybees and other 
pollinators in order to assess the need for conducting field 
demonstration studies on honeybees and other pollinators. The 
reason for constitution of another Expert Committee is not 
known or forthcoming. This Expert Committee, headed by Dr. 
Sanjay Kumar Mishra, Scientist H, DBT, Government of India 
and Co-Chairman, GEAC, held two meetings in September, 2022 
and it outrightly recommended environmental release of 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11. Also, further evaluation 
was to be carried out as per ICAR guidelines. Thus, the Expert 
Committee took a dramatically opposite view as compared to 
GEAC with regard to the field demonstration studies on the effect 
of GE mustard on honeybees and other pollinators. In the 136th 
GEAC meeting, it was recommended by GEAC that the same be 
conducted prior to the environmental release. This Expert 
Committee, on the other hand, suggested that within two years, 
post-environmental release under the supervision of ICAR, the 
effect of GE mustard on honeybees and other pollinators may be

studied and a report be submitted to GEAC. For immediate 
reference, the relevant extracts of the Expert Committee 
recommendation is extracted as under: 
“The Expert Committee had deliberations and in-depth 
consideration of the scientific evidences, including data 
available on GM Canola cultivation & honey production 
in other countries and correlated all the concerned 
issues of contemporary relevance under Indian scenario. 
Additionally, inputs on the above issues from Members 
of the Expert Committee, Department of Biotechnology 
(DBT), Ministry of Science and Technology; and 
Department of Agriculture Research & Education 
(DARE), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare 
were also considered and deliberated. The DBT opined 
that “it seems likely that there were no major deviations 
in the behaviour of honey bees when compared among 
the transgenic and non-transgenic comparator lines. 
GEAC may consider its recommendations of the 133rd 
meeting on the environmental release of GE mustard”. 
The DARE opined that “GEAC may consider exempting 
additional studies on the impact of GM mustard hybrid 
DMH-11 containing the bar, barnase, and barstar genes 
on honey bees and honey as decided in its 136th meeting 
and the recommendation of the 133rd meeting of GEAC 
may be considered”. 
 
Based on the examination of scientific evidences 
available globally, and as per the recommendations of 
concerned ministries, it seems unlikely that the bar, 
barnase, and barstar system will pose an adverse impact 
on honey bees and other pollinators. Therefore, the 
Committee was of the view that GEAC may consider the 
environmental release of GE mustard and further 
evaluation to be carried out as per ICAR guidelines for 
release and notification.

However, to generate scientific evidences in Indian agro-
climatic 
situation 
and 
also 
as 
a 
precautionary 
mechanism, the Expert Committee suggests that the 
field demonstration studies with respect to the effect of 
GE mustard on honey bees and other pollinators, as 
recommended in the 136th GEAC meeting, may also be 
conducted post-environmental release, simultaneously 
by the applicant, within two years under supervision of 
ICAR and the report be submitted to the GEAC.” 
(underlining by me) 
 
42.5 Further, on 18.10.2022, when the 147th Meeting of the 
GEAC was convened, as many as seven members communicated 
their inability to attend the meeting and Dr. Geeta Jotwani, 
Scientist ‘G’ at Indian Council of Medica Research (ICMR) did not 
attend the meeting. Consequently, eight persons remained 
absent and only fourteen members participated i.e. almost one-
third of the GEAC did not attend the crucial meeting, the GEAC 
took into consideration only the recommendations of the Expert 
Committee constituted few weeks before which had given its 
recommendations on 08.10.2022 and noting the same, the 
recommendations were accepted by pursuing the comments 
received from DBT and DARE. The above is evident on perusal of 
the Minutes of the 147th Meeting of the GEAC held on 18.10.2022 
as well as the Agenda Item No.4 which concerns the application 
relating to environmental release made by the applicant. Thus, 
GEAC simply recommended the environmental release of 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 without any deliberation as 
such, which recommendation was accepted by the Central 
Government. As a result, the following consequences are noted:  

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 208 of 260 
 
 
 
(i) all the previous deliberations and decisions of GEAC 
as well as the recommendations and suggestions of 
the sub-committee to GEAC were given a go by and 
totally ignored.  
(ii) the deferring of the field demonstration between the 
years 2018 to 2021, which was for valid reasons, 
was also ignored.  
(iii) on 25.10.2022, no reason was assigned for the 
change in stance, insofar as conducting studies on 
the effect of GE mustard on honeybees and other 
pollinators post-environmental release. This was 
contrary to what was decided earlier by GEAC.  
(iv) thus, on the basis of the opinion of this Expert 
Committee, GEAC brushed aside its earlier decision 
taken in the 134th and 136th meetings to undertake 
field demonstration and restrict the area to only five 
acres at two to three different locations with a view 
to generate additional data on honeybees and other 
pollinators, and on soil microbial diversity, which 
decision was also put on hold by GEAC.  
 
42.6 There is no reason forthcoming as to why GEAC completely 
changed its stance in the 147th meeting held on 18.10.2022. This 
resulted in the decision of the Union Government on 25.10.2022 
impugned herein. However, it is apparent that the trigger for this 
volte-face in the stand of GEAC was the letter dated 10.05.2022 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 209 of 260 
 
 
 
written by Prof. Deepak Pental to the Hon’ble Union Minister for 
Environment, Forest and Climate Change. There is no material 
put forth for the sudden decision taken by the Union Government 
on receiving the changed recommendation of GEAC, when 
earlier, it was submitted before this Court that the Union 
Government was still deliberating on the matter, which aspect is 
evident from the orders passed by this Court when in fact field 
demonstration was also put on hold by GEAC. Such being the 
position from the year 2018 onwards, all of a sudden 
environmental release of DMH-11 was approved even in the 
absence of field trials for conducting studies on the impact of 
honeybees and other pollinators.  
 
42.7 I observe that a statutory functionary entrusted or 
authorised to carry out certain functions contemplated under a 
statute must do so in accordance with law and known procedure. 
Where a statutory authority exercises its jurisdiction, conferred 
on it by a statute or rules made thereunder, it has to apply its 
own mind and the procedures laid, therefore, must be 
scrupulously followed. (vide V.K. Ashokan vs. Assistant Excise 
Commissioner, (2009) 14 SCC 85 (paras 52 and 54).  Every 
statutory authority is also bound by the rule of reasonableness 
and fairness and its action must be free from arbitrariness.   
 
42.8 Moreover, when an authority changes its policy decision, it 
is expected to give valid reasons and act in the larger interest of 
the entire community.   The persons representing a public body 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 210 of 260 
 
 
 
are expected to discharge their functions faithfully and in 
keeping with the trust reposed in them.  A statutory body, when 
it acts in terms of a statute, is bound by its action. It cannot 
supplement or supplant the reasons later on by way of an 
affidavit. It is well settled that while a power is exercised by an 
authority, ordinarily the reasons contained in the order should 
be supported by the material on record. It is absolutely essential 
that the authority making the order is alive to the material on 
the basis of which it purports to take the decision.  It cannot act 
mechanically or under an impulse, but after due and proper 
application of mind. A statutory authority exercising its power 
does so in trust, only to be exercised for a legitimate purpose and 
along the settled principles of administrative law.  Application of 
mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of mind by the authority 
making the order and said disclosure is best done through 
recording the reasons that led the authority to pass the order in 
question.  Absence of reasons either in the order passed by the 
authority or in the record contemporaneously maintained, is 
clearly suggestive of the order being arbitrary, hence legally 
unsustainable.  
 
42.9  The authority cannot neglect to do that which the law 
mandates and requires doing.  It is necessary that an executive 
or administrative function should be exercised with clarity, so as 
to enable legal certainty in the decision-making process bearing 
in mind the requisites for a valid exercise of power.

Public Trust Doctrine: 
42.10 
The aforementioned curious lapses of procedure and 
propriety are especially acute because they are in the teeth of the 
public trust doctrine applicable in the instant case, which holds 
immense significance when a decision impacting environmental 
and ecological vitality is impugned. The public trust doctrine 
enjoins upon the Government to protect the natural resources as 
well as the environment for the enjoyment of the general public 
rather than to permit their use for private ownership or 
commercial purposes. In M.C. Mehta vs. Kamal Nath, 1996 (9) 
Scale 141, this Court has observed that there is no reason why 
the public trust doctrine should not be expanded to include all 
ecosystems operating in our natural resources. The State is the 
trustee of all natural resources and the public at large is the 
beneficiary of the same.  The State is, therefore, under a legal 
duty to protect the natural resources.  Similarly, in Lal Bahadur 
vs. State of U.P., (2018) 15 SCC 407 (“Lal Bahadur”), this 
Court held that the Government has a duty to protect the 
environment and the Courts also must bear in mind that in cases 
concerning environmental governance, it has to discharge its 
duties by assessing the case on the basis of the material placed 
before it. This is because matters concerning environmental 
governance concern not just the living, but also generations to 
come, which is the basis of the doctrine of inter-generational 
equity.

42.11 
Similarly, in Centre for Public Interest Litigation 
vs. Union of India, (2012) 3 SCC 1 (“Centre for Public Interest 
Litigation”), it was observed that the doctrine of equality which 
emerges from the concept of justice and fairness, must guide the 
State in determining the actual mechanism for distribution of 
natural resources. This Court has further observed that every 
holder of public office by virtue of which he acts on behalf of the 
State or public body is ultimately accountable to the people in 
whom the sovereignty vests.  As such, all powers so vested in a 
public officer are meant to be exercised for public good and 
promoting the public interest.  Every holder of a public office is 
therefore a trustee.  If a decision is taken without any principle 
or without any rule, it is unpredictable and such a decision is an 
antithesis to the decision taken in accordance with the rule of 
law.  This Court had further observed that the public trust 
doctrine is a part of the law of the land and it has grown from 
Article 21 of the Constitution of India.  This implies that the 
power vested by the State in a public authority should be used 
as a trust coupled with duty to be exercised in larger public and 
social interest.  Power is to be exercised strictly adhering to the 
statutory provisions and fact situation of a case.  
 
42.12 
It is observed that in the instant case, while the Union 
of India made a submission before this Court that no final 
decision had been taken by it regarding the environmental 
release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11, yet, pursuant to 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 213 of 260 
 
 
 
the letter written on behalf of the applicant to the Hon’ble 
Minister for Environment, the matter moved swiftly possibly 
“from the top” and GEAC responded by constituting another 
Expert Committee which gave its recommendation to GEAC as 
desired.  
 
42.13 
Furthermore, while granting permission of the 
environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11, 
the condition imposed was that usage of any formulation or 
herbicide would not be permitted for cultivation in the farmer’s 
field and any such use in the farmer’s field without due approval 
would attract appropriate legal action under various enactments. 
There is no indication as to how the use of any herbicide could 
be prevented, rather, the condition not to use any herbicide was 
open-ended without having any means to check whether any 
herbicide would be used in the farmer’s field pursuant to the 
environmental release. The adverse effects of use of herbicide 
were also totally given a go by. 
 
42.14 
I also note that on granting permission for the 
environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11, 
there was no procedure envisaged for any study or research on 
the impact on non-target organisms and soil microbes to be 
conducted prior to the commercial cultivation of transgenic 
mustard hybrid DMH-11. I find that it was necessary to have 
requisite studies and research carried out on the experimental 
environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11, 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 214 of 260 
 
 
 
not only prior to the environmental release but, if permitted, 
subsequently before commercial cultivation of the said crop. I 
find this to be a serious lacuna under Rule 13(2) of the 1989 
Rules. 
 
42.15 
Further, any evidence of harmful effects or damage to 
the environment, nature and health owing to non-compliance of 
conditions stipulated by GEAC was also left open-ended. While 
recommending environmental release of transgenic mustard 
hybrid DMH-11 parental lines bn 3.6 carrying barnase and bar 
genes, and modbs 2.99 containing barstar and bar genes, it is 
not clear whether the conditions imposed by GEAC were 
adequate and sufficient and in the interest of environment, 
particularly in light of the sub-committee’s recommendations to 
GEAC as the same were to be acted upon as the matter was 
seized by this Court and was being monitored.  
 
42.16 
Moreover, I find that GEAC’s proposal was simply 
accepted by the MoEF&CC and immediately notified without any 
further consideration at the level of the Ministry and without 
having any inter-departmental consultation with the Ministry of 
Health, MoA and DBT in the Ministry of Science and Technology. 
It appears that GEAC recommended what MoEF&CC wanted 
pursuant to Prof. Pental’s letter to the Hon’ble Minister himself 
in May, 2022. 
 
42.17 
Also, no consultation was held with the States wherein 
mustard is grown, although agriculture is a State subject under 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 215 of 260 
 
 
 
Entry 14 of List II of the Constitution. The other concerned 
stakeholders also ought to have been consulted before a decision 
was taken by the Union of India in terms of the recommendation 
of GEAC. The Union of India could not have unilaterally acted on 
such a serious matter without bringing to the notice of the 
States, particularly in the northern and northwestern States of 
the country where mustard is being grown. I also record that the 
States of Bihar, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, 
Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, West Bengal and 
Karnataka had earlier expressed reservations against field 
testing and release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11. In my 
view, the States cannot be treated as satellites of the Union of 
India as they have constitutional identity and powers and 
responsibilities conferred under the Constitution of India and 
therefore, their views in the matter are of significance, vide S.R. 
Bommai vs. Union of India, (1994) 3 SCC 1, Para 99 (“S.R. 
Bommai”), reiterated in State (NCT of Delhi) vs. Union of 
India, (2018) 8 SCC 501. The consideration of the views of the 
pertinent States by a regional or national consultation would 
have made the decision-making process wholesome, as a wider 
consultation in matters such as the one under consideration 
would make the decision to be taken less vulnerable to attack 
and less arbitrary. But the impugned decision of the Union of 
India, based on a flawed procedure adopted by GEAC at the 
instance of the applicant, is arbitrary and liable to be interfered 
with by this Court when it is justified. In these circumstances, 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 216 of 260 
 
 
 
the decision of the respondent-Union of India dated 25.10.2022, 
as well as the recommendation of GEAC dated 18.10.2022, are 
liable to be set aside.   
 
42.18 
Further, no material has been brought before us to 
point out as to how the decision of GEAC was accepted by 
MoEF&CC and the recommendation of the environmental release 
of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 was simply permitted. As 
discussed hereinabove, the grant of approval by GEAC is 
governed by Rule13. The said Rule does not contemplate any role 
for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change 
(MoEF&CC) in the decision-making process. Therefore, the 
lateral intervention by the said Ministry seriously undermines 
the credibility and integrity of the decision making as well as the 
regulatory process. Although the applicant is not a private entity 
but a Centre in Delhi University (South Campus), the status of 
the applicant would not matter in arriving at a decision as in the 
instant case. 
 
42.19 
I observe that the principle of public accountability 
and transparency in State action are applicable to the cases of 
execution or statutory exercise of power. Every officer in the 
hierarchy of the State by virtue of his being a public 
officer/servant is accountable for his decisions to the public as 
well as to the State. The concept of dual responsibility should be 
applied in larger public interest and proper governance. In other 
words, where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 217 of 260 
 
 
 
way, the thing must be done in that way or not at all and other 
methods of performance are necessarily forbidden. This principle 
has also been expressed in terms of the Latin maxim expressio 
unius est exclusio alterius, which means that when a manner is 
specified for doing a certain thing, then all other modes for 
carrying 
out 
such 
act 
are 
expressly 
excluded. 
Vide, Taylor vs. Taylor, (1875) LR 1 Ch D 426 (“Taylor”) 
and Nazir Ahmad vs. King-Emperor, 1936 SCC OnLine PC 41 
: (1935-36) 63 IA 372 (“Nazir Ahmad”). This Court too has 
applied this maxim in the following cases: 
(i) Parbhani 
Transport 
Cooperative 
Society 
Ltd. vs. Regional 
Transport 
Authority 
Aurangabad, (1960) 3 SCR 177 : AIR 1960 SC 
801 (“Parbhani Transport Coop. Society”), 
wherein it was observed that the rule provides that 
an expressly laid down mode of doing something 
necessarily implies a prohibition of doing it in any 
other way. 
(ii) In Dipak Babaria vs. State of Gujarat, (2014) 3 
SCC 502 (“Dipak Babaria”), this Court set aside 
the sale of agricultural land on the ground that the 
sale was not in compliance with the statutory 
procedure prescribed in that regard under the 
Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands (Vidarbha 
Region and Kutch area) Act, 1958. The matter was 
examined on the anvil of the aforestated maxim and 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 218 of 260 
 
 
 
it was held that alienation of agricultural land by 
adopting any alternate procedure to the one 
prescribed under the Act was necessarily forbidden. 
(iii) In Kameng Dolo vs. Atum Welly, (2017) 7 SCC 
512 (“Kameng Dolo”), election of an unopposed 
candidate was declared as invalid on the ground 
that the nomination of his opponent was not 
withdrawn 
as 
per 
the 
procedure 
statutorily 
mandated. It was held that the nomination of the 
opposite candidate ought to have been withdrawn in 
the manner provided for under the relevant statute 
and withdrawing the same in any other manner was 
necessarily forbidden. Hence, his election was 
declared as void. 
(iv) Similarly, 
in Tahsildar, 
Taluk 
Office, 
Thanjore vs. G. Thambidurai, (2017) 12 SCC 642 
(“Tahsildar”), the assignment of land was cancelled 
on the ground that statutory requirements were not 
followed in assigning the land. It was held that when 
a statute prescribes that a certain Act is to be 
carried out in a given manner, the said Act could not 
be carried out through any mode other than the one 
statutorily prescribed. 
(v) It may also be apposite to refer to the decision of this 
Court in Union of India vs. Charanjit S. Gill, 
(2000) 5 SCC 742 (“Charanjit S. Gill”), wherein 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 219 of 260 
 
 
 
this Court held that any provisions introduced by 
way of “Notes” appended to the sections of the Army 
Act, 1950, could not be read as a part of the Act and 
therefore such “Notes” could not take away any right 
vested under the said Act. It was observed that 
issuance of an administrative order or a “Note” 
pertaining to a special type of weapon to bring it 
within the ambit of the Army Act, which was hitherto 
not included therein, could not be said to have been 
included in the manner in which it was supposed to 
be included. It was noted that the Army Act 
empowers the Central Government to make rules 
and regulations for carrying into effect the 
provisions of the Act; however, no power was 
conferred upon the Central Government of issuing 
“Notes” or “issuing orders” which could have the 
effect of the Rules made under the Act. As Rules and 
Regulations or administrative instructions can 
neither be supplemented nor substituted by “Notes”, 
administrative instructions issued or the “Notes” 
attached to the Rules which are not referable to any 
statutory authority were not be permitted to bring 
about a result, which is supposed to be achieved 
through enactment of Rules. 
 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 220 of 260 
 
 
 
42.20 
What emerges from the above discussion is that when 
a statute contemplates a specific procedure to be adhered to in 
order to arrive at a desired end, such procedure cannot be 
substituted 
by 
an 
alternative 
procedure 
which 
is 
not 
contemplated under the statute. Further, if an action is to be 
carried out by way of issuance of a particular statutory 
instrument on the basis of certain requirements, such action 
cannot be validly carried out by way of issuance of an instrument 
when the same is not contemplated under the statute. 
 
42.21 
It is also noted that at the crucial 147th meeting of 
GEAC held on 18.10.2022, there was no representative of the 
ICMR, Ministry of Health. Hence, the matter was not considered 
from the paradigm of the adverse effect on the health of human 
beings and animals as well as on other plants in the event of 
environmental release. Dr. Geeta Jotwani, Scientist F, ICMR, 
who did not participate in the meeting of GEAC held on 
18.10.2022, simply sent an e-mail to the effect that she had 
concurred with the recommendation of GEAC even in the 
absence of knowledge about the deliberations of the GEAC. 
 
42.22 
In this regard, I also find that the recommendations of 
the TEC submitted to this Court have been completely ignored 
by GEAC, as another Expert Committee was constituted by it 
pursuant to the letter dated 10.05.2022 submitted by Prof.

Climate Change. It is also not known whether the TEC report was

placed before GEAC as well as the Expert Committee or that they 
had ever been apprised of the same. I observe that Prof. Pental’s 
letter dated 10.05.2022 to the Hon’ble Minister of Environment, 
Forest and Climate Change is a classic case of seeking a lateral 
intervention by the Minister of the Union of India, bypassing 
what had been decided by GEAC in its 137th meeting held on 
20.03.2019. It is clear that pursuant to the intervention of the 
Ministry, GEAC constituted another Expert Committee and 
simply accepted its recommendations for the environmental 
release of DMH-11 hybrid mustard. This was by ignoring all 
previous deliberation made by GEAC, its sub-committee 
constituted earlier and its decision to proceed with precaution. 
 
43. Having regard to the aforesaid discussion, I am of the view 
that the GEAC approval dated 18.10.2022 and the consequent 
decision dated 25.10.2022 regarding the environmental release 
of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 is vitiated.  I also find that 
the impugned approval was in gross violation of the principle of 
public trust. 
  
 
Re: Point No.2: Whether the decision to grant approval for 
environmental release of DMH-11 violates the right to safe 
and healthy environment under Article 21? 
 
Right to safe and healthy Environment: 
43.1 I next consider whether the right to safe and healthy 
environment would be violated by unanticipated adverse effects 
of the impugned approval for environmental release of DMH-11. 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 222 of 260 
 
 
 
While I am cognizant of the submission of the learned Attorney 
General that the Court cannot go into the nuances of science and 
technology and give a finding on their merits, at the same time, 
I do not find substance in his argument that the petitioners’ 
apprehensions are only a baseless hypothesis. In the instant 
case, the complexity of reasonable risk assessment in the context 
of preserving the right to a safe and healthy environment can be 
understood with reference to some comparative perspectives. 
(i)  The judgment of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in 
State of the Netherlands (Ministry of Economic Affairs 
and Climate Policy) vs. Stichting Urgenda, 19/00135 
dated 20.12.2019 is apposite to appreciate the scope of 
judicial review, when the State, as in the present case, 
argued that the decision to fulfil obligations under 
environmental law is within the policy domain and cannot 
be interfered with by courts of law. The controversy raised 
by the State of the Netherlands before the Netherland’s 
Supreme Court was that the Hague District Court ought not 
to have directed the State to limit the combined volume of 
Dutch annual greenhouse gas emissions in such a manner 
that they have reduced by at least 25% at the end of 2020 
compared to the level of the year 1990. The Netherland’s 
Supreme Court dismissed the State’s challenge by applying 
the precautionary principle. The Netherland’s Supreme 
Court took note of the real risks of dangerous climate change 
which necessitate more stringent measures. It reasoned that 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 223 of 260 
 
 
 
mere lack of complete scientific certainty about the efficacy 
of the ordered reduction scenario does not exempt the State 
from its duty to undertake sufficient measures. Also, in the 
absence of certainty, a high degree of plausibility of the 
efficacy of the more stringent pathway was sufficient. The 
Netherland’s Supreme Court held that the obligation to take 
measures exists if there is a risk that serious environmental 
contamination may affect people’s well-being and prevent 
them from enjoying their homes in such a way as to affect 
their private and family life adversely. The Netherland’s 
Supreme Court specifically repelled the argument that in the 
system of the separation of powers, courts should not 
interfere with the democratically legitimised Government’s 
attendant policy choices. It proffered the reason that in the 
given context, the State’s violation of the right to life and 
right to respect for private and family life necessitated 
judicial direction for remedial measures. 
Therefore, disputes seeking review of administrative 
decisions impacting the environment turn on the relative 
weight that a decision maker accorded to competing 
considerations while perceiving the larger public interest. 
Environmental regulation is supposed to be a reasoning 
process that takes account of the social context in which the 
putative environmental effects could occur, the reliability of 
available information regarding the consequences, the 
existing institutional history of prevention and containment, 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 224 of 260 
 
 
 
and the probability of perceived consequences. It was 
concluded that while an excessive focus on probabilities can 
benefit the proponent of a potentially hazardous activity, the 
imbalanced deference to consequences can give way to the 
prohibition of such activities. 
(ii)  The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights 
(ECHR) in Fadeyeva vs. Russia, [2005] ECHR 376: (2007) 
45 EHRR 10 (“Fadeyeva”) is apposite in this regard. The 
case concerned an application filed by a Russian citizen who 
averred that the operation of a steel plant in close proximity 
to her home endangered her health and well-being and 
thereby violated Article 8 of the ECHR.  Article 8 guarantees 
the right to respect private and family life. The ECHR 
considered Article 42 of the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation which states, “Everyone has the right to a 
favourable environment, to reliable information about its 
state, and to compensation for damage caused to his health 
or property by ecological offences.” The ECHR acknowledged 
that given the information asymmetry between the claimant 
of a rights violation and the State, it would be impossible to 
apply the rule of affirmanti, non neganti, incumbit probation 
(the burden of proof is upon him who affirms - not on him 
who denies) rigorously. It was held that the very strong 
combination of indirect evidence and presumptions makes it 
possible to conclude that the applicant's health deteriorated 
as a result of her prolonged exposure to the industrial 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 225 of 260 
 
 
 
emissions from the Severstal steel plant. Even assuming that 
the pollution did not cause any quantifiable harm to her 
health, it inevitably made the applicant therein more 
vulnerable to various illnesses. Moreover, there can be no 
doubt that it adversely affected her quality of life at home. 
Therefore, the ECHR accepted that the actual detriment to 
the applicant's health and well-being reached a level 
sufficient to bring it within the scope of Article 8 of the 
Convention and cast a positive duty on the State to take 
reasonable and appropriate measures. Having held so, it was 
concluded that the State had failed to design or apply 
effective measures to protect the local population from 
pollution. 
(iii)  Therefore, the application of a rigorous reasoning process 
that emphasizes potential consequences, as manifested in 
the final report of the TEC, is expedient when there exists a 
fundamental asymmetry between the probability and 
consequences of the activity, such as the environmental 
release of GMOs. The failure to conduct chronic and 
transgenerational studies to study the impact on human 
health is a significant omission within the risk assessment 
process in the instant case. As noted hereinabove, 
conducting the said studies was a critical facet of the TEC’s 
recommendations and the same was fortified by the PSC 
Report, 2017. In my view, this asymmetry between probable 
benefits and adverse consequences cannot be adequately 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 226 of 260 
 
 
 
counter-balanced by economic or policy safeguards because 
of the serious and irreversible public and environmental 
health effects if such consequences occur. In this regard, the 
reasoning of this Court in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad 
(104) vs. Union of India, (2008) 2 SCC 222 (“T.N. 
Godavarman”) fortifies my view. It was reasoned therein 
that while mining was a revenue generating industry, the 
constitutional requirement of sustainable development could 
not be lost sight of. It was held that courts are required to 
balance development needs with the protection of the 
environment and ecology. It is the duty of the State under 
our Constitution to devise and implement a coherent and 
coordinated programme to meet its obligation of sustainable 
development based on inter-generational equity.  
(iv)  Such asymmetry becomes especially acute in light of the long 
acknowledged disparity between polluters and those 
adversely affected by pollution. A reference to this Court’s 
judgment in Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai 
vs. Ankita Sinha, (2022) 13 SCC 401 (“Ankita Sinha”) 
would be relevant as it recognized the asymmetrical 
relationship between the polluters and those affected by 
their actions in the following words:  
“78. When substantive justice is elusive for a large 
segment, disengaging with substantive rights at the 
very altar, for a perceived procedural lacuna, would 
surely bring in a process, which furthers inequality, 
both economic and social. An “equal footing” 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 227 of 260 
 
 
 
conception may not therefore be feasible to 
adequately address the asymmetrical relationship 
between the polluters and those affected by their 
actions. Instead, a recognition of the historical 
experience of marginalised classes of persons while 
accessing and effectively using the legal system, will 
allow for necessary appreciation of social realities 
and balancing the arm of justice.” 
 
43.2 Nothing explains this asymmetry better than the subsisting 
grievance of the petitioners about the failure to make the 
biosafety dossier, i.e., the primary data on which the AFES report 
is based, accessible to affected parties, i.e., the farmers, the farm 
workers, the consumers, other experts in the field and the 
citizenry at large, thereby, seriously undermining the right to 
environmental information. This is more so because such denial 
of access to environmental information is in contravention of the 
order of this Court dated 08.04.2008 and subsequent order 
dated 12.08.2008. The order dated 08.04.2008 records that in 
the absence of toxicity and allergenicity data, the members of the 
public and the scientists would not be able to make effective 
representations to the concerned authorities. It was on the 
solemn assurance of the then ASG - that the said primary data 
pertaining to field trials will be placed in the public domain and 
on the website of GEAC - that this Court had disposed of the 
applications made by the petitioner. There has been absolute 
non-adherence of the said assurance. I also note that the Reply 
Affidavit filed by the Union of India had specifically stated that 
the full dossier could not be made available on the website and 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 228 of 260 
 
 
 
that an independent review of such a dossier by members of the 
public would undermine the credibility of the extant regulatory 
regime. 
 
43.3 I observe that the right to environmental information comes 
within the scope of the right to information, which came to be 
articulated by this court in State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Raj 
Narain, (1975) 4 SCC 428, para 74 (“Raj Narain”), as the 
public’s right to know every public act that is done by public 
functionaries subject, of course, to absolute secrecy to be 
maintained in certain circumstances. It is also a critical aspect 
of the right to freedom of speech and expression, vide Chief 
Information Commissioner vs. State of Manipur, (2011) 15 
SCC 1 (“Chief Information Commissioner”). Disclosure of 
information is the rule in our system of open governance, and 
secrecy is an exception vide S. P. Gupta vs. Union of India, 
(1981) Supp SCC 87 (para 67) (“S. P. Gupta”). Transparency 
is critical to preserve the integrity of the decision-making 
process. Public scrutiny would be crucial to evaluate the putative 
separation of interests and influence between scientific research 
and regulatory policy formulation.  
 
43.4 The access to environmental information facilitates 
'meaningful engagement' and rights-conscious decision-making. 
The engagement with stakeholders through the participative 
process inspires confidence in the decision-making process and 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 229 of 260 
 
 
 
leads to more sound outcomes which are less vulnerable to legal 
challenge. 
 
43.5 The presence of sufficient safeguards such as transparency, 
accountability and public participation wherever permissible 
within the decision-making process is critical to ensure that 
regulatory decisions are not made on partial and uncontested 
scientific evidence. In this context, I take note of the dicta in 
Harvester Co. vs. Ruckelshaus, 478 F.2d 615, 652 (D.C. Cir. 
1973) (“Harvester Co.”), wherein the US Court of Appeal, DC 
Circuit held that prior to adjudicating difficult technological 
questions, the judiciary ought to be assured that such questions 
are first "resolved in the crucible of debate through the clash of 
informed but opposing scientific and technological viewpoints." 
But the approach of GEAC has been quite contrary to the 
approach 
explained 
above. The 
record 
shows 
that 
on 
22.09.2016, various scholars and public activists endorsed an 
email addressed to the Hon’ble Minister of Environment, Forest 
and Climate Change raising serious objections to the conduct of 
the appraisal process, particularly the refusal to disclose the 
biosafety dossier to the general public. They urged the MoEF&CC 
to extend the consultation process by another 120 days. In 
addition to the email, on 24.09.2016, scholars, experts, and 
eminent citizens sent a letter to the Hon’ble Minister of 
Environment, Forest and Climate Change, expressing grave 
concerns regarding GEAC’s refusal to disclose the biosafety data 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 230 of 260 
 
 
 
to the general public, hindering a meaningful exercise of public 
consultation. These objections initially weighed with GEAC to 
defer environmental release of DMH-11 in the years 2019-2021. 
But in the year 2022, things moved with an undue haste and 
speed and thereby GEAC ignored all precautionary measures 
suggested by TEC as well as by the sub-committee constituted 
by it and simply leaf frogged into the impugned decision dated 
18.10.2022. This, I find, has adverse legal and environmental 
consequences. 
The other critical right is that of public participation in 
environmental decision-making.  
 
44. Moving further, learned Attorney General submitted that 
pursuant to the TEC Report submitted to this Court, several 
guidelines and a legal framework were put in place. In this 
regard, I have perused the specific guidance documents issued 
in the year 2016, said to be in accordance with the CPB, to 
further strengthen the risk assessment procedure.  
 The same are discussed as under: 
i. Risk Analysis Framework, 2016 provides a step-by-step 
consultation process for seeking views from stakeholders: 
a) 
Information about submission of applications is 
communicated through the minutes of the meetings. 
b) 
A RARM plan for each application is prepared by the 
regulatory agencies and is uploaded on the official 
website for receiving comments for a period of 30 days. 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 231 of 260 
 
 
 
c) 
Regulatory agencies give recommendations after duly 
considering the responses. 
ii. Guidelines for Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for 
Genetically Engineered Plants, 2016: 
a) 
The guidelines require that a risk assessment be 
performed prior to the commercial release of a GE plant 
in India.  
b) 
The purpose of the risk assessment is to identify risks to 
the health and safety of people and the environment 
from the cultivation of the GE plant, when compared 
with the cultivation of the non-GE version of the plant. 
c) 
Information requirements include characteristics of 
genetic modification, cultivation practices and post-
release environmental monitoring. 
iii. Regulations and Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research 
and Biocontainment, 2017 seek to ensure appropriate 
containment strategy ensuring safety to laboratory workers 
as well as others and the environment from hazardous 
micro-organisms, GE organisms or cells. 
iv. Guidelines and SOPs for the Conduct of Confined Field 
Trials: Confined Field Trials are monitored by RCGM/GEAC-
appointed Central Compliance Committees which are site-
specific and comprise subject experts. 
 
44.1 Given their import to the issue at hand, I limit my analysis 
to the Risk Analysis Framework, 2016 and the Guidelines for 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 232 of 260 
 
 
 
Environmental 
Risk 
Assessment 
(ERA) 
for 
Genetically 
Engineered (GE) Plants, 2016. While one of the stated purposes 
of the Risk Analysis Framework includes provision of 
transparency on the use of risk analysis to support decision-
making, the continued reluctance to publish the biosafety 
dossier and respond to concerns about long-term effects by 
provisioning requisite chronic and transgenerational toxicity 
studies shows that it is inadequate. The modalities of 
communicating the RARM plan must be inclusive and 
transparent. The failure to publish the biosafety dossier on the 
website reveals a deficiency in the Guidelines for Environmental 
Risk Assessment (ERA) for Genetically Engineered (GE) Plants, 
2016. Furthermore, the failure to furnish cogent reasons for 
giving a go by to field demonstration studies to study the impact 
on honeybees also reveals the lack of safeguards against misuse 
of discretion. With respect to post-release monitoring, I note that 
the MoEF&CC issued an office order on 10.11.2022 to constitute 
an Expert Committee of four members for Post Release 
Monitoring Committee (PRMC). The terms of reference are to visit 
the growing sites of DMH-11 at least once during each season. 
However, the term of its functioning is limited to a period of four 
years from the date of issue.  
 
44.2 Given the fact that the unanticipated consequences of the 
environmental release of DMH-11 remain in the sphere of 
uncertainty, I am impelled to construe the failure to undertake 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 233 of 260 
 
 
 
necessary measures in light of the TEC and the PSC 
recommendations and the non-compliance with directions of this 
Court as a violation of the right to a safe and healthy 
environment. The violation is particularly serious in light of the 
benchmarks of environmental regulation prescribed by this 
Court in T.N. Godavarman. 
 
44.3 The failure to adequately assess health and environmental 
impact of GM crops seriously infringes upon intergenerational 
equity as it potentially endangers the ability of future citizens 
to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health. This Court 
in State of Himachal Pradesh vs. Ganesh Wood Products 
(1995) 6 SCC 363 (“Ganesh Wood Products”) had invoked 
intergenerational equity while taking cognizance of the ‘totally 
faulty and a myopic approach’ of the State towards forest 
management and regulation. This Court held that mechanically 
granting approvals for manufacturing ‘katha’ by felling khair 
trees was ‘contrary to public interest involved in preserving forest 
wealth, 
maintenance 
of 
environment 
and 
ecology 
and 
considerations of sustainable growth and inter-generational 
equity.’ This Court reasoned that ‘the present generation has no 
right to deplete all the existing forests and leave nothing for the 
next and future generations’ and therefore, the approvals were 
vitiated. This Court also emphasized that the obligation of 
sustainable development mandates proper assessment and 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 234 of 260 
 
 
 
monitoring so that forest industries function in a balanced 
manner.  
 
44.4 The State’s obligation to ensure intergenerational equity 
was also invoked while directing the preparation of appropriate 
management 
plans 
for 
regulating 
the 
use 
of 
fragile 
coastlines vide Indian Council for Enviro-legal Action vs. 
Union of India (1996) 5 SCC 281. 
 
44.5 In view of the aforesaid discussion, I am of the view that the 
decision to grant approval for environmental release of 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 violates the right to safe and 
healthy environment under Article 21 of the Constitution of India 
because the safeguards which were necessary to be taken prior 
to the grant of the approval have not been taken in the instant 
case. 
 
Consequently, directions have been issued in the 
succeeding paragraphs. 
 
Re: Point No.3: Whether GEAC’s grant of approval dated 
18.10.2022 and the decision dated 25.10.2022 for the 
environmental release of DMH-11 violate the precautionary 
principle? 
 
Precautionary Principle: 
45. As discussed earlier, the precautionary principle is one of 
the doctrinal foundations of Indian environmental law. The 
principle is an instance of distillation of ecological wisdom.  Given 
the fact that genetic engineering has made what was 
inconceivable a reality, precaution is the need of the hour. For 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 235 of 260 
 
 
 
billions of years, each living organism would exchange DNA with 
others of its kind. Genetic engineering transcends this natural 
principle by combining genes sourced from widely different 
species and transferring genes between organisms that had no 
natural possibility of interbreeding. Scientific research of such a 
novel nature must therefore happen under supervision and in a 
manner that inspires public confidence.  
 
45.1 It is said that the regulatory regime should recognize 
sufficiently the limits of scientific knowledge, and adopt a wider 
system-based interdisciplinary analysis. A diversity of expert 
opinions ranging from the disciplines of biotechnology, 
environmental 
law, 
ethics, 
sociology, 
agriculture, 
and 
sustainable economics should engage in open and public 
dialogue. Such an open dialogue is necessary in order to mitigate 
the possibility of regulatory agencies and applicants exaggerating 
the benefits of a proposed technology or diluting the rigours of 
environmental safety or health standards.  
 
46. Having regard to the conclusions of the TEC, I find that the 
apprehensions of the petitioners that HT crops would exert a 
highly adverse impact over time on sustainable agriculture, rural 
livelihoods, and the environment are not unfounded. It is 
reasonable to infer that there is a potential of loss of species of 
indigenous mustard crop, as India is the centre of origin and 
diversity, which fact cannot be doubted. The concerns about the 
impact on other beneficial organisms, such as honeybees, 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 236 of 260 
 
 
 
earthworms etc. are also well-founded and serious. As per the 
precautionary principle, those activities which may disturb 
nature shall be proceeded only upon ex-ante assessment of their 
consequences. Such a sound risk and impact assessment is also 
a binding obligation under Article 14(1)(b) of the CBD and Article 
26 of the CPB. Therefore, GEAC is duty bound, both under 
domestic and international law, to sanction long-term chronic 
and intergenerational studies, as recommended by the TEC. The 
reluctance to conduct such studies would risk the health of 
future generations as well as the farmers’ right to conduct their 
agricultural activities in the most suitable manner. In this 
regard, it would be pertinent to quote the paragraph 28 of the 
301st Report of PSC as under: 
“28. 
The Committee notes that the currently, twenty 
years after their introduction in 1996, only 6 countries 
continue to account for over 90% of all GM crop area 
globally (USA 40%, Brazil 23%, Argentina 14%, India 
6%, Canada 6%, China 2%). The Committee was 
informed by the members of civil society during the 
deliberation on the subject that there was a decline in 
GM crop area in 2015. The Committee notes with 
surprise that inspite of the fact that GM technology is 
being propagated as the most advanced agricultural 
technology, 17 of the 20 most developed countries (HDI) 
do not grow it which includes most of Europe, Japan, 
Russia, Israel etc. The Committee opines that there is 
increasing evidence about the lack of safety of GM crops 
and little or no benefits to justify the risks, most 
countries in the world do not grow GM crops. The 
Committee also feels that the policy makers of these 
countries, as custodians for both present and future 
generations, have seen that GM organisms spread

rapidly, that the impacts have been unpredictable, 
potentially hazardous, uncontrollable and irreversible, 
assessed the benefits and risks, taken note of emerging 
evidence of harm, and therefore do not permit GM crops. 
The non acceptance of the most advanced agricultural 
technology, GM technology, by the most developed 
countries raises doubts about the efficacy of the 
technology. The Committee, therefore, feels that the 
Government of India should conduct a comparative 
study to examine the reasons for not accepting this 
technology by these developed countries viz-a-viz the 
reasons led to its acceptance.” 
(underlining by me) 
 
 
47. There are considerable concerns that the HT GM technology 
depends on huge chemical spraying. In this regard, learned 
counsel Dr. Ravindra Chingale brought to my notice the three 
unstarred questions raised before the Rajya Sabha on 
15.03.2021, 22.03.2021 and 08.12.2022 (the latest being after 
the 
decision 
taken 
by 
GEAC 
and 
the 
MoEF&CC 
for 
environmental release of transgenic mustard DMH-11 hybrid). 
Law courts under Section 57(4) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, 
can take judicial notice of the course of proceedings of the 
Parliament. The answering of parliamentary questions is a part 
of the conduct of business of the Parliament. Therefore, no 
question about its admissibility under Section 74, the Indian 
Evidence Act, 1872 would arise.

the cotton area is under the cultivation of Bt 
cotton and the productivity has increased from 
191 Kg per hectare in 2002-03 to 455.00 Kg per 
hectare in 2019-20. Per hectare income of the 
farmer has also increased. There has also been 
a reduction in the usage of insecticide for 
bollworm damage from 24 sprays to 2-3 sprays 
in a season.

herbicide tolerance trait, even if only for seed production 
purposes; and 
(c) if not, the reason thereof? 
ANSWER 
MINISTER 
OF 
STATE 
IN 
THE 
MINISTRY 
OF 
ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE 
(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY) 
 
(a) to (c) 
The bar gene in Mustard hybrid DMH-11 is 
expressed which encodes phosphinothricin N-
acetyl 
transferase 
enzyme 
that 
confers 
resistant to herbicide glufosinate ammonium. 
 
Genetically Modified (GM) Hybrid Mustard 
DMH-11 has not been approved for Herbicide 
Tolerant (HT) trait but for a GM technology for 
hybrid 
seed 
production. 
The 
HT 
characteristic/trait 
present 
in 
the 
GM 
Mustard 
hybrid 
seed 
is 
essential 
for 
eliminating 
fertile 
plants 
that 
are 
not 
transgenic in the hybrid seed production plots 
to maintain the purity of hybrid seed. The use 
of herbicide will be limited to seed production 
stage 
by 
the 
seed 
producing 
company/institute 
and 
not 
during 
the 
commercial cultivation of DMH-11 by the 
farmers. The use of herbicide will be after 
obtaining label claim and approval from 
Central Insecticide Board and Registration 
Committee (CIB&RC). 
 
The 
biosafety 
research 
trials 
including 
environmental safety studies have been 
conducted for transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11 containing barnase, barstar and bar 
genes, events bn 3.6 (Barnase line) and modbs 
2.99 (Barstarline).

The issue of environmental release of GM 
Mustard is under adjudication in the Writ 
Petition (Civil) 115/2004 and Writ Petition 
(Civil) 260 of 2005 titled as Gene Campaign 
vs. UoI & Ors. and Aruna Rodrigues vs. UoI & 
Ors., respectively before the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of India. 
(underlining by us) 
 
47.1 It is needless to observe that taking note of the said 
questions and answers so as to appreciate the stance of the 
Government at the particular point of time would be in line with 
the constitutional scheme in general and the Rules of Procedure 
and Conduct of Business in the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) 
(‘Rajya Sabha Rules’). 
 
47.2 On a reading of the above, it is clear that the stand of the 
MoEF&CC before the Parliament has been as follows: 
(i) that processed GM foods is dealt with under Section 22 of 
the FSSA, 2006, which had not yet been operationalised. 
This was as on 15.03.2021, but thereafter on 02.11.2021, 
the Central Government has appointed the said date as the 
date on which clause (2) of Explanation of Section 2 of the 
FSSA, 2006 shall come into force. The said clause deals with 
GM or engineered organisms obtained through modern 
biotechnology.  
(ii) More critically, it is also admitted by the MoEF&CC that the 
FSSAI has not undertaken any study on impact of GM foods 
on the health of individuals in the country. 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 243 of 260 
 
 
 
(iii) Subsequently, on 22.03.2021, it has been stated that Bt 
cotton is the only GM crop that has been approved for 
commercial cultivation in India.  
(iv) Thereafter, on 08.12.2022 a specific question, namely, 
whether the bar gene in parental lines and hybrid offspring 
of Delhi University’s transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-
11confers HT to transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 plants, 
even as it is useful as a marker gene was asked. The answer 
given was that the bar gene in mustard hybrid DMH-11 is 
expressed which encodes enzyme that confers resistance to 
herbicide glufosinate ammonium.  
(v) But it is stated in the same answer that Genetically Modified 
(GM) hybrid mustard DMH-11 has not been approved for 
herbicide tolerant (HT) trait but for a GM technology for 
hybrid seed production. The HT characteristic/trait present 
in the transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 seed is essential 
for eliminating fertile plants that are not transgenic in hybrid 
seed production plots to maintain the purity of hybrid seeds. 
It was also stated that the use of herbicide will be limited at 
the time of seed production stage and not during the 
commercial cultivation of DMH-11 by the farmers. Such use 
of herbicide, it was stated, will be after obtaining label claim 
approval from the Central Insecticide Board and Registration 
Committee (CIB&RC). The Minister noted that the biosafety 
research trials including environmental safety studies had 
been conducted for transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 244 of 260 
 
 
 
containing barnase, barstar and bar genes, events bn 3.6 
(Barnase line) and modbs 2.99 (Barstarline). 
(vi) Further, he noted that the issue of environmental release of 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 is under adjudication in 
the present cases. 
 
47.3 Having given my anxious consideration to the report of the 
TEC and the PSCs, I am convinced that the ability to conduct 
robust risk assessment hinges upon the availability of 
indigenous and independent studies and research. It follows that 
conclusions about safety assessment and ecological impact 
cannot be transplanted from research conducted in a foreign 
context. Crucially, the recommendation of Expert Committee 
constituted by GEAC in the year 2022 after Prof. Pental’s letter 
to the Hon’ble Minister of Environment, which is the basis of 
GEAC’s impugned approval, is entirely premised upon foreign 
studies and research and not on indigenous research or studies. 
This, I find, is a serious omission, on the part of GEAC in not 
applying its mind to research studies to be conducted within the 
country as India has a unique biodiversity and a socio-economic 
structure of society which is directly related to land holdings and 
conduct of agricultural operations. 
 
47.4 It is also noted that Dr. Sanjay Kumar Mishra, Scientist ‘H’, 
DBT, New Delhi, who is one of the members of GEAC (Co-
Chairman), was made Chairman of the Expert Committee 
constituted by GEAC in the 146th meeting which was held 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 245 of 260 
 
 
 
pursuant to the letter written by Prof. Deepak Pental on behalf 
of the CGMCP, University of Delhi (South Campus) to the Hon’ble 
Minister 
of 
Environment. 
The 
crucial 
portions 
of 
the 
recommendations have been extracted above. 
On a reading of the same, it is evident that the Expert 
Committee has made its recommendations on the opinion of the 
DBT and the DARE which are bodies within the Ministries of the 
Government. They are not independent scientific bodies. 
Therefore, the Expert Committee could not have relied upon the 
opinion of the DBT and the DARE. Also, based on the 
examination of scientific evidences available globally, and as per 
the recommendations of concerned Ministries, it was observed 
by the Expert Committee that it was unlikely that the bar, 
barnase, and barstar system would pose an adverse impact on 
honeybees and other pollinators. What is the pertinent scientific 
evidence available globally or in other countries and how the said 
evidence was co-related to all the concerned issues of 
contemporary relevance under Indian scenario, has not been 
explained. That the Expert Committee has been swayed by the 
opinion of the DBT and the DARE is opponent. DBT opined that, 
“it seems likely that there were no major deviations in the 
behaviour of honeybees when compared among the transgenic 
and non-transgenic comparator lines. GEAC may consider its 
recommendations of the 133rd meeting on the environmental 
release of GE mustard.” The aforesaid opinion is contrary to what 
was expressed by the sub-committee constituted by the GEAC 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 246 of 260 
 
 
 
when the matter was being considered prior to the 133rd meeting. 
DARE opined that, “GEAC may consider exempting additional 
studies on the impact of GM mustard hybrid DMH-11 containing 
the bar, barnase, and barstar genes on honey bees and honey as 
decided in its 136th meeting and the recommendation of the 133rd 
meeting of GEAC may be considered.” There is no reason 
expressed as to why GEAC should exempt additional studies on 
the impact of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 on honeybees 
and honey as decided in 136th meeting. In other words, the 
Expert Committee has recommended what exactly was required 
by the applicant i.e. to give effect to the recommendations of the 
133rd meeting of GEAC. 
 
47.5 In fact, the constitution of Expert Committee in the year 
2022 itself is an eye-wash, inasmuch as the Ministry of 
Environment required the report of the so-called Expert 
Committee in order to approve the application given by CGMCP, 
University of Delhi (South Campus), which is contrary to the 
stand of GEAC in its earlier meetings. The report of this Expert 
Committee therefore was tailor-made and “suitable” in order that 
GEAC could accord approval to the application submitted by 
CGMCP. As already observed, the Expert Committee relied upon 
scientific evidence available globally and not based upon the 
agro-ecological realities in India. Therefore, not much credence 
can be given to the recognition of this Expert Committee which 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 247 of 260 
 
 
 
was the basis of the decision/recommendation dated 18.10.2022 
made to MoEF&CC. 
 
47.6 Next, I have perused the conditions imposed by GEAC while 
according approval to CGMCP, University of Delhi (South 
Campus), the applicant. It is apparent that the precautionary 
principle has been seriously undermined in Condition VI and VII 
that have been prescribed by GEAC for the impugned release. 
Although Condition VII prohibits farmers from using any 
formulation of herbicide in the fields, it is unclear how such a 
prohibition would be enforced. Given the nature of the DMH-11 
which according to the petitioners has HT characteristics, the 
impact upon non-target organisms and beneficial organisms 
could be seriously detrimental to agrarian ecology. The proposed 
conditions for approval are neither adequate nor feasible to limit 
these consequences. I observe that GEAC has failed to take into 
consideration the precautionary principles while approving the 
environmental release of the transgenic mustard DMH-11 
hybrid. 
 
48. Wisdom lies in precaution. As the upholder and protector 
of constitutional wisdom and values, this Court has no option 
but to hold that the decision-making process for the grant of 
approval for the environmental release of DMH-11 has violated 
the precautionary principle. Reiterating Vellore Citizens and 
A.P. Pollution Control Board, this Court in RFSTE, noted that 
the position of the precautionary principle is well-entrenched in 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 248 of 260 
 
 
 
our jurisprudence and would govern the law of the land in light 
of Articles 47, 48A and 51A(g) of the Constitution. Thereafter, in 
T. N. Godavarman Thirumulpad vs. Union of India, (2006) 1 
SCC 1, this Court applied the precautionary principle while 
directing that all precautionary measures must be taken when 
forest lands are diverted for non-forest use. 
 
48.1 Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board vs. C. 
Kenchappa, (2006) 6 SCC 371 (“C. Kenchappa”) is another 
case where this Court applied the precautionary principle to 
emphasize on the requirement of carrying on an impact 
assessment and obtaining necessary environmental clearance 
before execution of an industrial activity. It was directed that, in 
future, before acquisition of lands for development, the 
consequence and adverse impact of development on the 
environment must be properly comprehended and the lands be 
acquired for development so that they do not gravely impair the 
ecology and environment. 
 
48.2 The precautionary principle was pressed into service in 
Democratic Youth Federation of India vs. Union of India 
(2011) 15 SCC 530 (“Democratic Youth Foundation of India”) 
to ban the use of the endosulfan pesticide until a court-appointed 
committee conducted a risk assessment of the same. It was also 
applied in Hospitality Association of Mudumalai vs. In 
Defence of Environment & Animals, (2020) 10 SCC 589 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 249 of 260 
 
 
 
(“Hospitality Association of Mudumalai”) where it was held 
that: 
“39. … The precautionary principle makes it mandatory 
for the State Government to anticipate, prevent and 
attack the causes of environmental degradation. In this 
light, we have no hesitation in holding that in order to 
protect the elephant population in the Sigur Plateau 
region, it was necessary and appropriate for the State 
Government to limit commercial activity in the areas 
falling within the elephant corridor.” 
 
48.3 Furthermore as noted above, this Court gave an expansive 
scope to the application of the precautionary principle beyond 
adjudicatory 
orders 
to 
any 
decision, 
administrative 
or 
commercial ought to be made by the Government or private 
parties in anticipation of serious environmental harm. In 
Pragnesh Shah vs. Dr. Arun Kumar Sharma, (2022) 11 SCC 
493 (“Pragnesh Shah”), it was explained that the precautionary 
principle 
requires 
the 
State 
to 
act 
in 
advance 
to prevent environmental harm from taking place, rather than 
by adopting measures once the harm has taken place. In 
deciding when to adopt such action, the State cannot hide 
behind the veil of scientific uncertainty in calculating the exact 
scientific harm by observing as under:  
“36. The precautionary principle envisages that the 
State cannot refuse to act to preserve the environment 
simply because all the scientific data may not be 
available. If there is some data to suggest that 
environmental degradation is possible, the State must 
step into action to prevent it from taking place. Indeed, 
it was this thought that compelled this Court in T.N. 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 250 of 260 
 
 
 
Godavarman [T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of 
India Writ Petition No. 202 of 1995] to direct the State to 
identify ESZs across India, so that steps can be taken to 
identify areas where there is a greater possibility of 
environmental degradation and a plan is put in place 
to prevent such degradation before it actually makes the 
harm irreversible.” 
48.4 Relying upon H.P. Bus-Stand, this Court held that 
actualising the framework of environmental rule of law requires 
that the courts cannot be stupefied into inaction due to scientific 
uncertainty but must take decisions to protect the environment 
based on whatever information is available.  
 
48.5 Recently this Court in M.K. Ranjitsinh while considering 
protection of the Great Indian Bustard and the Lesser Florican 
both kinds of birds which are on the verge of extinction, observed 
as under: 
“35. 
India faces a number of pressing near-term 
challenges that directly impact the right to a healthy 
environment, particularly for vulnerable and indigenous 
communities including forest dwellers. The lack of 
reliable electricity supply for many citizens not only 
hinders 
economic 
development 
but 
also 
disproportionately 
affects 
communities, 
including 
women 
and 
low-income 
households, 
further 
perpetuating inequalities. Therefore, the right to a 
healthy environment encapsulates the principle that 
every individual has the entitlement to live in an 
environment that is clean, safe, and conducive to their 
well-being. By recognizing the right to a healthy 
environment and the right to be free from the adverse 
effects of climate change, states are compelled to 
prioritize environmental protection and sustainable 
development, thereby addressing the root causes of 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 251 of 260 
 
 
 
climate change and safeguarding the wellbeing of 
present and future generations. It is imperative for states 
like 
India, 
to 
uphold 
their 
obligations 
under 
international law, including their responsibilities to 
mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to climate 
impacts, and protect the fundamental rights of all 
individuals to live in a healthy and sustainable 
environment.” 
 
48.6 In this context, I would also like to refer to the relevant 
Articles of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention 
on Biological Diversity which specifically deals with living 
modified organisms to mean any living organism that possesses 
a novel combination of genetic material obtained through the use 
of modern biotechnology (Article 3g) as well as Articles 15 and 16 
of the said Protocol which deal with risk assessment and risk 
management respectively. It is necessary to refer to the said 
Articles as India is a signatory to the said Protocol and 
Convention. 
 
 I may further refer to the Convention on Biological 
Diversity and particularly, on Article 8(g) which states that each 
contracting party shall, as far as possible and as appropriate 
establish or maintain means to regulate, manage or control the 
risks associated with  the use of release of living modified 
organisms resulting from biotechnology which are likely to have 
adverse 
environmental 
impacts 
that 
could 
affect 
the 
conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking 
also into account the risks to human health. 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 252 of 260 
 
 
 
 
48.7 It is too late in the day to even entertain the proposition that 
the protection of our natural environment and ecology is not a 
constitutional imperative. The evolution of the right to a safe and 
healthy environment and the concomitant duty of the State to 
uphold public trust and abide by inter-generational equity and 
the precautionary principle in environmental regulation is the 
bedrock of environmental constitutionalism. The environmental 
rights regime is a product of decades of environmental litigation 
by civil society, social movements, affected communities and the 
general citizenry. In that sense, environmental constitutionalism 
is a facet of transformative constitutionalism touching upon the 
socio-economic lives of citizens. In other words, the affected 
communities must have a substantive role in environmental 
governance.  
 
48.8 While this court in T.N. Godavarman has crystallised the 
role of environmental regulators and the Executive arm of the 
State since it mandates adequate technical capacity and 
effectiveness so as to attain optimal environmental performance, 
a weak regulatory regime can render environmental rights 
illusory. At the same time, technical capacity and effective 
regulation cannot be realised without democratic engagement, 
dialogue and deliberation. The aspiration of transformative 
environmental governance cannot be realised merely through an 
effective 
bureaucracy 
and 
sound 
technical 
expertise. 
Environmental democracy and environmental rights are two

sides of the same coin. In this regard, the facts of this case shed 
light on the salience of the legislative role in preserving 
environmental democracy.  
 
48.9 Environmental decision-making in a rapidly changing 
climate requires healthy contestation of alternative worldviews, 
interests and rights. Only through such contestation can a fine 
and sustainable balance between development and the 
environment 
be 
arrived 
at. 
The 
Department-related 
Parliamentary Standing Committees and other legislative 
committees discharge important functions. In the context of the 
environment, these committees are mandated to scrutinise 
public issues from multiple perspectives, appreciate available 
evidence, consult experts and the members of the affected 
communities and thereafter render a principled and considered 
report. Open and transparent deliberation on expert knowledge 
increases accountability and acts as a safeguard against conflict 
of interest but not a closed door decision making process. 
 
48.10 
Consequently, I hold that the approval dated 
18.10.2022 and consequent decision dated 25.10.2022 for 
environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 
violate the precautionary principle inasmuch as there has been 
no determination made, as to, whether, transgenic mustard 
hybrid DMH-11 is a HT crop and if so, the nature of risk that 
would be caused by the said plant to the environment including 
other plants as well as to human beings and animals. The 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 254 of 260 
 
 
 
deliberations have not focussed inter alia, on the aspects of 
biosafety, risk assessment, soil health, micro-biology and socio-
economic aspects etc.  Moreover, the recommendations of the 
TEC and Parliamentary Standing Committees’ Reports on 
Agriculture and on Science and Technology, Environment and 
Forest have not been considered.  Consequently, directions have 
been issued in the succeeding paragraphs.   
 
Conclusion: 
49.  In view of the aforesaid discussion and findings, I conclude 
as under:  
(i) the recommendations of GEAC dated 18.10.2022 as well as 
the decision taken by the respondent Union of India on 
25.10.2022 with regard to approving environmental release 
of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 on the application 
made by the applicant, namely, CGMCP, University of Delhi 
(South Campus’) are vitiated and hence, they are liable to be 
quashed and are quashed.  
(ii) I further observe that the recommendation of the Expert 
Committee constituted by the GEAC in the year 2022 is of 
no consequence and not binding. 
50. Consequently, I issue the following directions: 
(a) With regard to approving environmental release of transgenic 
mustard hybrid in future on the application made by the 
applicant, namely, CGMCP, University of Delhi (South 
Campus) or by any other applicant: 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 255 of 260 
 
 
 
(i) 
there shall be a decision taken by GEAC, in the first 
instance, on whether, transgenic mustard hybrid 
DMH-11 is a HT crop or not, by having a wide and 
meaningful consultation on the report of TEC 
submitted to this Court with all stakeholders, 
including experts in the field of agriculture, 
biotechnology, 
health 
experts 
and 
other 
scientists/experts preferably within a period of four 
months from today. A report on this aspect must 
be submitted by GEAC to MoEF&CC. 
(ii) 
MoEF&CC must publish an official report, with 
adequate publicity to the said report, on whether 
the GE mustard hybrid DMH-11 is indeed a HT 
crop or not, preferably within a period of one month 
from the date of receipt from GEAC.  
(iii) for the aforesaid purposes, GEAC is directed to 
upload the applicant’s biosafety dossier comprising 
3285 pages on its website after prior intimation to 
the applicant CGMCP, University of Delhi (South 
Campus) within a period of two weeks from today. 
This is with a view to bring in transparency in the 
matter. 
(iv) 
The aforesaid biosafety dossier shall remain on the 
website of GEAC for a minimum period of 30 days 
from the date it is uploaded so as to enable the 
stakeholders to respond to the said dossier. On 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 256 of 260 
 
 
 
receipt of such response, if any, GEAC shall collate 
the said responses, and take the same into 
consideration for its future course of action. 
(v) 
In the event, GEAC and MoEF&CC conclude that 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 is a HT crop, 
then the nature of risk that would be caused by the 
said plant to the environment including other 
plants as well as to human beings and animals 
must be researched and deliberated upon. The 
deliberations must take into consideration different 
aspects, such as biosafety, risk assessment, soil 
health, micro-biology and socio-economic aspects 
etc. 
(vi) 
After taking a decision on the nature and 
characteristic of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-
11, the respondent shall take a policy decision in 
the matter afresh on environmental release of 
transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 on receipt of 
the report from GEAC in future bearing in mind 
health and environmental aspects of transgenic 
mustard hybrid DMH-11. 
(vii) In the above context, the respondent-Union of India 
shall also comply with the recommendations made 
by 
Technical 
Expert 
Committee 
(TEC) 
on 
Agriculture, Science and Technology, discussed 
above to the extent they are not contrary to the 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 257 of 260 
 
 
 
aforesaid directions and if not already complied 
with. 
(viii) The respondent-Union of India shall also comply 
with 
the 
recommendations 
made 
by 
the 
Parliamentary Standing Committees (PSCs) on 
Agriculture and on Science and Technology, 
Environment and Forest, to the extent they are not 
contrary to the aforesaid directions if not already 
complied with. 
(ix) With regard to import of GM edible oil such as 
mustard or canola being made, the requirements of 
Section 23 of FSSA, 2006 in the matter of 
packaging and labelling shall be complied with by 
the respondent-Union of India as early as 
practicable. 
 
I also issue certain general directions in relation to GM crops 
as under: 
(b) 
The respondent-Union of India is directed to evolve 
a National Policy with regard to GM crops in the 
realm of research, cultivation, trade and commerce 
in the country. The said National Policy shall be 
formulated in consultation with all stakeholders, 
such as, experts in the field of agriculture, 
biotechnology, State Governments, representatives 

 
 
     
 
Writ Petition (Civil) No.115 of 2004 Etc.                                                                   Page 258 of 260 
 
 
 
of the farmers, etc. The National Policy to be 
formulated shall be given due publicity. 
(c) 
For the aforesaid purpose, the MoEF&CC shall 
conduct a national consultation, preferably within 
the next four months, with the aim of formulating 
the National Policy on GM crops. The State 
Governments shall be involved in evolving the 
National Policy on GM crops. 
(d) 
That the composition of GEAC shall be suitably 
reformed bearing in mind the recommendations of 
the TEC and the PSC Reports and the dictum of 
this Court in the case of T.N. Godavarman 
discussed above. The reformed composition shall 
comprise of experts in the field of agriculture, 
biotechnology, ethics, sociology, health as well as 
experts in the field of environment and shall be an 
independent and autonomous body. This could be 
done either by a statute or amendments being 
brought to the existing Rules as thought fit by the 
respondent-Union.   
(e) 
Respondent – Union of India must ensure that all 
credentials and past records of any expert who 
participates in the decision-making process should 
be scrupulously verified and conflict of interest, if 
any, should be declared and suitably mitigated by 
ensuring representation to wide range of interests.

Rules in this regard may be formulated having 
statutory force. 
(f) 
The specific guidance documents referred to above 
in paragraph No.42 that have been adopted in 
conformity 
with 
the 
Cartagena 
Protocol 
on 
Biosafety (CPB) shall be complied with in letter and 
spirit insofar as they are applicable to the Indian 
context. These guidance documents shall be 
accorded statutory status by framing and issuing 
appropriate Rules under Section 25 of the EP Act, 
1986. 
(g) 
In the matter of importing of GM food and more 
particularly GM edible oil, the respondent shall 
comply with the requirements of Section 23 of 
FSSA, 2006, which deals with packaging and 
labelling of foods. 
 The aforesaid directions have been issued by me bearing in 
mind, Articles 14 and 21 of the Fundamental Rights; Article 48A 
of the Directive Principles of State Policy of the Constitution as 
well as the statutory framework applicable to the controversy 
under consideration. 
 
51.  The writ petitions are disposed of in the aforesaid terms and 
the civil appeal does not survive for any further consideration 
and hence stands disposed of.

3 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
1. I have perused the erudite opinion of my sister, Hon’ble Mrs. 
Justice B.V. Nagarathna. However, I am unable to agree with the 
findings, conclusions so drawn and certain directions given, 
therefore I deem it appropriate to pen down my independent 
opinion and issue directions.  
 
Preface 
2. The present lis concerns 6 petitions: 3 Writ Petitions (W.P. (C) No. 
115 of 2004; W.P. (C) No. 260 of 2005 and W.P. (C) No. 840 of 
2016), 2 Contempt Petitions (Contempt Petition (C) No. 295 of 2007 
and Contempt Petition No.6 of 2016) and 1 Civil Appeal (Civil 
Appeal No. 4086 of 2006).  
 
3. In the batch of Writ Petitions, under Article 32 of the Constitution 
of India, the lead matter was filed in 2004 (W.P. (C) No.115 of 
2004) praying for issuance of the Writ of Mandamus to the 
Respondents directing them to: 
 
i. 
Bring the Rules for Manufacture, Use, Import, Export and 
Storage 
of 
Hazardous 
Micro-organisms, 
Genetically 
Engineered Organisms or Cells, 1989, in consonance with 
Articles 14, 19, 21, 38, 47, 48, 48A read with 51-A(g) of the 

4 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
Constitution of India and in alternative, declaration of the 
above rules as unconstitutional.  
ii. Set-up a High Power Committee to formulate a National 
Policy on genetically engineered organisms through a multi-
stakeholder consultation process. 
iii. Observe 
a 
moratorium 
on 
various 
trials/approvals 
concerning genetically engineered organisms, particularly for 
which India is a Centre of Origin/Diversity till the Rules are 
amended and a sound regulatory and monitoring system is 
put in place.  
 
4. Writ Petition (C) No.260 of 2005 came to be filed seeking the 
following directions to the Union of India: 
 
i. 
To not allow any release of GMO’s into the environment by 
way of import, manufacture, use or any other manner unless 
the following precautions are taken.  
(a) A protocol for all the required bio-safety tests of the 
GMOs proposed to be released is prepared by the GEAC 
after processes of public notice and public hearing.  

5 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
(b) The GMO has been subjected to all the required bio-
safety tests, prepared on the basis of the required 
Biosafety tests on the basis of the above protocol, by 
agencies of independent expert bodies, and results of 
which have been made public.  
ii. To ban the import of any biological organism, food or animal 
feed unless they have been certified and labelled to be GM 
free, by the exporting country.  
iii.  To put in place rules to ensure that it shall be compulsory 
for any dealer or grower selling GMOs to label them as such.   
 
5. Writ Petition (C) No.840 of 2016 was filed seeking a Writ of 
Mandamus or direction to the effect of: 
 
i. 
Quashing the Notice dated 05.09.2016 issued by Union of 
India inviting comments from stakeholders and general 
public within 30 days as being violative of Article 14 and 
Article 21 of the Constitution of India. 
ii. The process adopted by GEAC as arbitrary and violative of 
Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India. 

6 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
iii. Union of India to frame appropriate procedural guidelines for 
appraisal of application seeking environmental release under 
Rules for Manufacture, Use, Import, Export and Storage of 
Hazardous 
Micro-organisms, 
Genetically 
Engineered 
Organisms or Cells, 1989. 
 
6. Contempt Petition (C) No.295 of 2007 was filed alleging 
contempt of orders of this Court dated 22.09.2006, 08.05.2007 
and 01.08.2007. Contempt Petition (C) No.06 of 2016 was filed 
alleging contempt of orders of this Court dated 15.02.2007, 
08.05.2007, 08.04.2008 and 12.08.2008. These orders come to 
be discussed in the foregoing paragraphs.   
 
7. Civil Appeal No.4086 of 2006 came to be filed against order of 
the Appellate Authority dated 08.10.2003, dismissing the appeal 
filed by the Appellant in Appeal No.2 of 2002, whereby the 
approval granted to Bt Cotton dated 05.04.2002 was assailed.  
 
8. This Court is often presented with situations where two 
competent interests call upon it to undertake a balancing act 
which is akin to threading a needle or, in other words, undertake 

7 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
a task of considerable difficulty. This case is one such task. On 
the one hand, is a group of concerned, informed individuals and 
organisations apprehensive about the potential impacts of new 
technology on the environment, agriculture, health and other 
socio-economic 
parameters; 
and 
on 
the 
other, 
is 
the 
government/competent authority batting for a cautious but 
optimistic approach furthering scientific and agricultural 
development, underscoring its importance in line with growing 
concerns of food security, population, economics and other  
matters of national interest.  
 
9. The former argues the dangers of unpredictability, unknowability 
of the effect of human intervention in seed production and 
otherwise pushes for the adoption of a precautionary approach 
while the latter insists on a stand which is not governed by fear 
of the unknown and the importance of backing scientific 
advancement and adventures, exploring its positive aspects and 
their integration into human society. This Court now hangs in the 
balance, upon being asked to adjudicate these prima facie well 

8 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
founded concerns and interests which are ostensibly at variance 
with one another.  
 
10. Throughout this judgment, certain terms will form the mainstay 
of the discussion, and adequate understanding of which, is 
imperative for arriving at a just conclusion. At the core, the 
question revolves around genetically modified organisms, their 
regulation and release into the environment. For ease of 
understanding, some of those terms are defined at the outset. 
 
10.1 Genetically Modified Organisms (hereinafter referred to 
as ‘GMOs’) have been defined by the World Health 
Organisation (WHO) as follows: 
 
“Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be 
defined as organisms (i.e. plants, animals or 
microorganisms) in which the genetic material (DNA) 
has been altered in a way that does not occur 
naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. 
The technology is often called “modern biotechnology” 
or “gene technology”, sometimes also “recombinant 
DNA technology” or “genetic engineering”. It allows 
selected individual genes to be transferred from one 
organism into another, also between nonrelated 
species.” 
 
 
10.2 GMOs, for our purposes, have two types- Bt (Bacillus 
thuringiensis) [a preparation of a bacterium (Bacillus 

9 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
Thuringiensis) often modified by genetic engineering for 
use as a biopesticide against insects and especially 
lepidopteran larvae1], and Ht (Herbicide Tolerant). 
[Herbicide-tolerant crops can be produced by either 
insertion of a “foreign” gene from another organism into a 
crop, or by regenerating herbicide-tolerant mutants from 
existing crop germplasm.2] 
 
10.3 Genetic Engineering Approval3 Committee (hereinafter 
referred to as ‘GEAC’) is a committee constituted under  
The Manufacture, Use, Import, Export And Storage Of 
Hazardous Micro Organisms Genetically Engineered 
Organisms Or Cells Rules, 1989 (hereinafter referred to 
as ‘1989 Rules’) which are in turn framed under the 
Environment Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred 
to as EPA, 1986) responsible for approval of proposals 
relating to release of genetically engineered organisms

and products into the environment including experiment 
Field trials. 
 
10.4 Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (hereinafter 
referred to as ‘RCGM’) is a committee under 1989 Rules 
tasked with monitoring the safety related aspects in 
respect of on-going research projects and activities 
involving genetically engineered organisms/hazardous 
microorganisms. 
 
Procedural History 
 
11. This Court has been actively engaged since 2004, with regard to 
the trial of GMOs, which is the subject matter at hand. Over the 
intervening years, this Court has issued a slew of orders and 
accordingly, in the subsequent paragraphs, I have traced the brief 
history of them.  
 
11.1 On 29.03.2004, notice was issued in the matter. 
Thereafter, on 01.05.2006, this Court directed that the 
field trials of GMOs shall be conducted only with the 
express approval of the GEAC. On 22.09.2006, it was 

11 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
directed that the GEAC will withhold approvals until 
further orders of this Court and it was suggested to the 
Union of India, that they should consider associating 
independent experts in the GEAC.  
 
11.2 On 13.10.2006, this Court granted permission to plant 
the newly developed DMH-11 (Mustard) for experimental 
purpose in specifically identified fields. Thereafter, on 
15.12.2006, the attention of this Court was drawn to 
Clause (23) of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 
which recommended that there is inadequate basis to 
assess the potential risks of genetic use technologies due 
to which the use of products involving this technology or 
field testing should not be approved till there is 
appropriate scientific data, in accordance with the 
precautionary principle. Taking note of this, the Court 
directed the GEAC to consider the impact of field testing 
being carried out.  
 
11.3 On 15.02.2007, this Court recorded the submission of the 
Union of India that within 6 weeks, it would bring on 

12 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
record the implications and the biological results of the 
field tests being conducted.  
 
11.4 Thereafter, on 08.05.2007, the Union of India sought 
modification of the order dated 22.09.2006 whereby 
further approvals by GEAC were halted. This Court 
allowed the GEAC to consider applications for use of Bt 
Cotton varieties for commercial use, subject to the usual 
conditions imposed provided that the GEAC verifies the 
creation of any toxicity with the use of varieties of Bt 
Cotton. It further directed the GEAC:  
 
a. To take sufficient precautions to see that the trials are 
not causing any contamination to the cultivation of 
neighbouring fields. 
b. Distance of at least 200 meters to be maintained from 
the neighbouring fields having the same type of 
cultivations.  
c. Names of scientists and other details of the person 
responsible for all aspects of the trial should be 
recorded with the GEAC.  

13 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
 
11.5 On 01.08.2007, this Court recorded the submission of the 
learned Additional Solicitor General, that allergenicity 
and toxicity tests have been conducted on Bt Cotton and 
the information would be put on the website of the GEAC.  
 
11.6 On 08.04.2008, the Petitioners sought modification of 
order dated 08.05.2007, to the effect that the distance 
between fields must depend on the nature of the crop. 
Further, the Petitioners contended that the validated 
protocol for field testing should be 0.01%. This Court 
directed the GEAC to examine both these issues and 
recorded the submission of the learned Additional 
Solicitor General that the data qua Bt brinjal and Bt 
cotton has been put on the website of the GEAC.  
 
11.7 On 12.08.2008, the Petitioners raised objection to non-
compliance of Order dated 08.04.2008, thereafter, this 
Court directed the Union of India to file proof regarding 
compliance of the said order.  
 

14 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
11.8 Pertinently, vide Order dated 10.05.2012, this Court 
appointed a Technical Expert Committee (hereinafter 
“TEC”) to look into various issues raised in the pleadings 
before the Court and submit a report within 3 months. 
The members of this Committee were:  1. Prof. VL Chopra; 
2. Dr. Imran Siddiqui; 3. Dr. PS Ramakrishna; 4. Prof. PC 
Chauhan; 5. Prof. PC Kesavan and 6. Dr. B Siva Kumar. 
Vide this Order, the Court also granted TEC the liberty to 
file an interim report, in case the final report is not 
prepared within the abovementioned time period. The 
terms of reference and the report of the TEC will be 
discussed in detail in the discussion which follows. 
 
11.9 The interim report of the TEC was received by this Court 
on 07.10.2012. Vide order dated 09.11.2012, the Union 
of India was directed to file its objections to the interim 
report, with the TEC itself for consideration. Furthermore, 
in place of Prof. VL Chopra, Dr. Rajendra Singh Paroda 
was appointed as a member of the Committee. On 

15 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
23.08.2013, this Court acknowledged receipt of the final 
report of the TEC.  
 
11.10 Thereafter, on 07.10.2016, the Union of India submitted 
that no release of GMOs will be made till 17.10.2016 since 
the Government has sought views from the public and on 
receipt of such views, they will be considered by a 
committee of experts. On 22.11.2017, when this matter 
was taken up for consideration, the Union of India 
apprised the Court that it had not taken a final decision, 
on the issue of plantation of GM Mustard and that all 
stakeholders shall be considered before taking a final 
decision.  
 
11.11 Coming to the present timeline, on 18.10.2022 the GEAC 
granted conditional approval for conducting trials of 
DMH-11/GM Mustard. The same was communicated to 
the applicants on 25.10.2022.   In terms of the above 
developments, the Petitioners have handed over updated 
prayers in Court seeking: 
 

16 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
i. 
Complete ban on Ht Crops. The decision of GEAC to 
approve release of DMH-11 is violative of Article 14 and 
Article 21 of the Constitution of India being vitiated by 
non-application of mind.  
ii. The overall process of risk assessment must be in 
conformity with the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.  
iii. Stakeholder 
participation, 
socioeconomic 
considerations, societal impact and sustainability 
should be incorporated in the risk assessment process 
at an early stage.  
iv. Studies must be conducted by the Regulatory Body 
itself and the regulator must not depend solely on the 
data provided by the applicant itself.  
v. The Biosafety Dossier containing results of these 
studies must be published on the website of the GEAC. 
vi. Confined Field Trials should be only in isolated 
conditions to prevent any contamination in ICAR 
institutes/State Agricultural Universities.  
vii. No Genetically Modified Crops should be permitted 
where India is the centre of origin or diversity.  

17 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
viii. There should be chronic toxicity testing in terms of long-
term exposure before declaring those crops safe.  
ix. State of the art bio-regulatory systems must be set up 
in collaboration with countries having the necessary 
expertise in socio-economic risk assessment.  
 
Statutory Framework 
 
12. At the outset, it is imperative to discuss the statutory framework 
relating to GMOs. The Seeds Act enacted by the Legislature in 
1966, notified on 29.12.1966, regulates the quality of seeds for 
sale and other connected matters. S.3 of this Act, created the 
Central Seed Committee to advise the Government on matters 
relating to the said Act. S.4 mandates creation of the Central Seed 
Laboratory and State Seed Laboratory. S.7 regulates the sale of 
certain varieties of seeds, which have been so notified.  
 
13.  The Insecticides Act, 1968 was enacted to regulate the use of 
insecticides with a view to prevent risk to human beings or 
animals. S.4 of this Act, constitutes the Central Insecticides 
Board to “advise the Central Government and State Government 

18 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
on technical matters arising out of the administration of this Act.” 
S.5 constitutes a Registration Committee, to “register insecticides 
after scrutinising their formulae and verifying claims made by the 
importer or the manufacturer, as the case may be, as regards their 
efficacy and safety to human beings and animals.” 
 
14. The EPA, 1986 was enacted with a view to improve the 
environment and its protection mechanisms. 
i. 
Under the definition Clause, S.2, certain terms require 
reference: 
 
“(a) "environment" includes water, air and land and 
the inter- relationship which exists among and 
between water, air and land, and human beings, 
other living creatures, plants, micro-organism and 
property; 
 
(b) "environmental pollutant" means any solid, liquid 
or gaseous substance present in such concentration 
as may be, or tend to be, injurious to environment; 
 
(c) "environmental pollution" means the presence in 
the environment of any environmental pollutant;    
 
   
x

the factory or the premises and includes in relation to 
any substance, the person in possession of the 
substance;” 
 
 
ii. S.3 of the Act empowers the Central Government to 
undertake wide-ranging measures for the protection and 
improvement of the environment. S.3(2) lays down the 
matters wherein such measures are to be exercised. Some 
pertinent areas are: 
 
“….. 
 
(vi) laying down procedures and safeguards for the 
prevention 
of

directions to such authorities, officers or persons as 
it may consider necessary to take steps for the 
prevention, control and abatement of environmental 
pollution; 
 
(xi) establishment or recognition of environmental 
laboratories and institutes to carry out the functions 
entrusted to such environmental laboratories and 
institutes under this Act;” 
 

20 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
iii. S.5 empowers the Central Government to issue directions to 
any person for the purposes of the Act, and such person will 
be bound to comply with such directions. 
iv. S.6 further provides the Central Government with the power 
to make rules for the matters enumerated in S.3. 
Particularly, the following have been expressly laid down in 
S.6(2), amongst others: 
“… 
 
(b) the maximum allowable limits of concentration of 
various environmental pollutants (including noise) for 
different areas; 
 
(c) the procedures and safeguards for the handling of 
hazardous substances; 
 
(d) the prohibition and restrictions on the handling of 
hazardous substances in different areas;” 
 
 
v. S.7 prohibits the discharge of environmental pollutants in 
excess of the standards as may be prescribed under S.3.  S.8 
provides that those persons handling hazardous substances 
shall not do so except in accordance with the procedure and 
safeguards prescribed in respect thereto.  

21 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
vi. S.10 empowers the Central Government or any person 
empowered under it with the power of entry and inspection 
at all reasonable times, for the following purposes:

rules made thereunder has been or is being or is 
about to be committed and for seizing any such 
equipment, 
industrial 
plant, 
record, 
register, 
document or other material object if he has reason to 
believe that it may furnish evidence of the commission 
of an offence punishable under this Act or the rules 
made thereunder or that such seizure is necessary to 
prevent or mitigate environmental pollution.” 
 
 
vii. S.11 empowers the Central Government or any person 
empowered under it with the power to take samples of air, 
water, soil or other substances and lays down detailed 
procedure to be followed for this purpose.   
 

22 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
viii.  S.12 permits the Central Government to establish and 
recognise laboratories or institutes to carry out functions 
enumerated for such laboratories which have to be notified 
in the gazette in accordance with S.12(2). 
 
ix. S.25 empowers the Central Government to make rules for 
carrying out the purposes of the Act. In particular, under 
S.25(2): 
 
“(a) the standards in excess of which environmental 
pollutants shall not be discharged or emitted under 
section 7; 
 
(b) the procedure in accordance with and the 
safeguards in compliance with which hazardous 
substances shall be handled or caused to be handled 
under section 8; 
  
x 
 
 
x

(e) the form in which notice of intention to have a 
sample analysed shall be served under clause (a) of 
sub section (3) of section 11; 
(f) the functions of the environmental laboratories, the 
procedure for the submission to such laboratories of 
samples of air, water, soil and other substances for 
analysis or test; the form of laboratory report; the fees 
payable for such report and other matters to enable 
such laboratories to carry out their functions under 
sub-section (2) of section 12;” 
 
15. The 1989 Rules were enacted by the Central Government under 
the EPA, 1986 with a view to protecting the environment, nature 

23 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
and health, in connection with the application of gene-technology 
and micro-organisms. 
 
i. Rule 2 specifies the application of these rules. Clause 2 
specifies that “These shall apply to genetically engineered 
organisms micro-organisms and cells and correspondingly to 
any substances and products and food stuffs, etc. of which 
such cells, organisms or tissues hereof form part.” 
ii.Rule 3(3) defines Gene Technology as “the application of the 
gene technique called genetic engineering, include self-cloning 
and deletion as well as cell hybridisation.” 
iii.Rule 3(4) defines Genetic Engineering as “the technique by 
which heritable material, which does not usually occur or will 
not occur naturally in the organism or cell concerned, 
generated outside the organism or the cell is inserted into said 
cell or organism. It shall also mean the formation of new 
combinations of genetic material by incorporation of a cell into 
a host cell, where they occur naturally (self-cloning) as well as 
modification of an organism or in a cell by deletion and 
removal of parts of the heritable material.” 

24 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
iv. Rule 4(4) of the aforesaid rules, provide for setting up of the 
GEAC as a body under the Department of Environment, 
Forests and Wildlife, for approval of proposals relating to 
release of genetically engineered organisms and products into 
the environment, including experimental field trials. These 
proposals are to be examined from the environmental angle. 
Other committees therein, the membership of the GEAC and 
other aspects will come to be discussed in the foregoing 
paragraphs.  
v. Rule 7 prohibits any import, export, manufacture, process or 
use of genetically engineered organisms except with the 
approval of the GEAC. It also provides that genetically 
engineered organisms for the purpose of research are only 
allowed in areas notified by the Ministry of Environment and 
Forests for this purpose under the EPA, 1986.  
vi. Rule 9 empowers the GEAC to grant special approval for 
deliberate release of genetically engineered organisms. 
vii. Rule 10 extends the requirement of approval of GEAC to all 
substances and products that contain genetically engineered 
organisms.  

25 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
viii. Rule 13 provides for stipulation of terms and conditions while 
granting approval including terms and conditions as to the 
control to be exercised by the applicant, supervision, 
restriction on use, the layout of the enterprise and as to the 
submission of information to the State Biosafety Co-ordination 
Committee (hereinafter referred to as ‘SBCC’) or to the 
District Level Committee (hereinafter referred to as ‘DLC’).  
It lays down the time period for GEAC approval (cannot exceed 
4 years) and specific criteria wherein the GEAC can revoke 
approval granted for a genetically engineered organism. Rule 
14 gives an authority to GEAC for supervising the 
implementation of the conditions laid down while granting 
approval.  
ix. Further, Rule 15 provides for penalties imposed for non-
compliance of orders. The DLC or SBCC is empowered to take 
actions against person who is responsible for non-compliance. 
In situations which require immediate interference, DLC or 
SBCC could take action even without issuing any order or 
notice. DLC or SBCC are also empowered to take samples for 
a more detailed examination of organisms and cells and for 

26 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
these purposes, these Committees could take assistance from 
any Government authority. 
x. Rule 18 grants the GEAC and other committees, the power to 
carry out inspections. 
xi. Rule 19 allows for appeal from the any decision made by the 
GEAC or the SBCC to the Appellate Authority (as may be 
appointed by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and 
Climate Change (hereinafter referred to as ‘MoEFCC’) within 
30 days of such decisions.   
 
16. In furtherance of the United Nations Convention on Biological 
Diversity, which has been ratified by India, The Biological 
Diversity Act, 2002 came to be introduced into the statute book. 
The aim and objective of this Act is to provide for conservation of 
biological diversity and its sustainable use. S.36 of this Act 
directs the Central Government to take measures for protection 
of biological diversity, its resources and habitats from 
environmental degradation and neglect. 
 
17. The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 is aimed at laying down 
science based standards for articles of food and to ensure 

27 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption. 
S.22 provides that no person shall manufacture, distribute or 
import any genetically modified articles of food or other articles of 
food enumerated therein. 
 
Issues for Consideration 
 
18.  I have heard extensive arguments on both sides, Mr. Sanjay 
Parikh, Mr. Trideep Pais, learned senior counsel, learned 
Advocates-on-Record Mr. Prashant Bhushan and Dr. Ravindra 
Chingale for the Petitioners and, Mr. R. Venkatramani learned 
Attorney General, Mr. Tushar Mehta learned Solicitor General 
and Ms. Preeti Kumari for the Respondents. The judgment 
proposed by my esteemed colleague, Hon’ble Mrs. Justice B.V. 
Nagarathna, records in detail the submissions advanced by all 
the learned counsel and so, for the sake of brevity I avoid doing 
the same. Principally, following issues are to be considered : 
 
a. Whether the conditional approval of DMH-11 by the GEAC 
is 
vitiated 
be 
it 
by 
arbitrariness/delegation/non-
application of mind or any other principle of law? 

28 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
b. Whether in view of the precautionary principle, a complete 
ban on Ht Crops is warranted or if not, the suitable 
directions that are required to be given by this Court?  
 
Here, it stands clarified that sub-issues/ancillary aspects to the 
above questions, have been dealt with as the opinion progresses. 
Conditional Approval of the GEAC 
 
19. The pressing challenge raised by the Petitioners, is the decision 
of the GEAC to conditionally approve environmental release of 
transgenic mustard, DMH-11 on varied grounds granted to the 
applicant namely the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop 
Plants (CGMCP), University of Delhi, New Delhi. This Centre was 
set up to undertake research on genetic engineering and 
molecular breeding of oilseed brassicas4. Before adverting to the 
challenges made, this Court must note the timeline leading up to 
the impugned approval.  
 
20. On 29.09.2010, in the 103rd GEAC Meeting was where for the first 
time approval was granted for BRL-I level trials at 3 locations, 
 
4 https://www.du.ac.in/index.php?page=centre-for-genetic-manipulation-of-crop-plants 

29 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
namely, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Kumher, Bharatpur, Rajasthan; 
Agricultural Research Station, Navgaon, Alwar, Rajasthan; 
Agricultural Research Station, Sriganganagar, Rajasthan. The 
Committee also approved the conduct of crossibility studies and 
limited seed production within the institutional research farm 
located at Jaunti village and Bawana, Delhi respectively. 
Thereafter on 21.09.2011, the GEAC granted further approval to 
conduct environmental safety studies on DMH-11. In the 121st 
meeting dated 18.07.2014, BRL-II trials in respect of DMH-11 
were approved at different locations subject to submission of NOC 
from the State Government. 
 
21. In the 126th Meeting of the GEAC, on 04.01.2016, a sub-
committee was constituted to further deliberate on the issues 
raised during deliberations of DMH-11. This was followed by the 
GEAC on 11.05.2017, examining the report of this sub-committee 
and recommending the proposal for environmental release of 
DMH-11 with terms and conditions for further approval by 
Competent Authority. In the next meeting on 21.03.2018, the 
GEAC re-examined its decision to grant permission for 

30 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
environmental release of DMH-11 and advised the applicant to 
undertake field demonstration studies on GM Mustard to 
generate additional data.  
 
22. On 20.09.2018 in its 136th meeting GEAC approved the 
application and the protocols for conduct of field demonstration 
studies on honeybees and other pollinators prepared by 
University of Delhi and ICAR-AICRP on honeybees at two 
locations up to 5 acres in each location namely PAU, Ludhiana 
and IARI, New Delhi and, for conduct of two field studies to assess 
hybrid seed efficiency and for maintenance of male sterile 
barnase line bn 3.6.  
 
23. This brings us to the 146th Meeting of GEAC held on 25.08.2022, 
wherein pursuant to a presentation by the applicant, the GEAC 
constituted a committee to examine availability of adequate 
evidence about impact of transgenic mustard on honeybees and 
other pollinators to assess the need for conducting field 
demonstration studies.  
 

31 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
24. On 18.10.2022, the 147th Meeting of the GEAC was held wherein 
it considered the report of the Committee and recommended 
environmental release of DMH-11. Thereafter on 25.10.2022, a 
letter was issued to the Applicant stating that the environmental 
release of genetically engineered mustard/DMH-11 has been 
recommended. The following conditions, amongst others, were 
imposed on this release: 
i. The approval is for 4 years and renewable for two years at a 
time based on compliance report pursuant to Clause 13 of 
the 1989 Rules. 
ii. A Post-Release Monitoring Committee would be constituted 
by GEAC consisting of 2 subject matter external experts who 
will visit the growing sites of the approved biological material.  
iii. The Applicant shall provide detailed step by step testing 
procedures to the GEAC.  
iv. Usage of any formulation of herbicide is not permitted for 
cultivation in farmers’ fields under any situation. 
v. Commercial use of DMH-11 hybrid shall be subject to Seeds 
Act, 1966.  

32 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
vi. It is mandatory that all seed packets of DMH-11 and 
subsequent hybrids derived from the technology should be 
appropriately labelled indicating the contents including the 
name of the transgenes, physical and genetic purity etc., in 
English, Hindi and vernacular language(s). 
 
Judicial Review of the Impugned Decision 
 
25. The challenges raised by the Petitioners to this decision can be 
summarised as follows: 
a. The GEAC could not have delegated its function to a sub-
committee/expert committee, since it is not within the scope 
of the 1989 Rules. 
b. Further, in any case, that the GEAC has not independently 
applied its mind to the report of its expert committee and has 
not considered other independent scientific reports. 
 
25 (a) 1. At the outset, I must consider, the scope of judicial review 
to be exercised in such matters. This Court in the case of N.D. 

33 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
Jayal v. Union of India (3-Judge Bench)5, which related to 
the safety of dams, observed that: 
 
“…This Court cannot sit in judgment over the cutting 
edge of scientific analysis relating to the safety of any 
project. Experts in science may themselves differ in 
their opinions while taking decisions on matters 
related to safety and allied aspects. The opposing 
viewpoints of the experts will also have to be given due 
consideration after full application of mind. When the 
Government or the authorities concerned after due 
consideration of all viewpoints and full application of 
mind took a decision, then it is not appropriate for the 
court to interfere. Such matters must be left to the 
mature 
wisdom 
of 
the 
Government 
or 
the 
implementing agency. It is their forte. In such cases, 
if the situation demands, the courts should take only 
a detached decision based on the pattern of the well-
settled principles of administrative law. If any such 
decision is based on irrelevant consideration or non-
consideration of material or is thoroughly arbitrary, 
then the court will get in the way. Here the only point 
to consider is whether the decision-making agency 
took a well-informed decision or not. If the answer is 
“yes”, then there is no need to interfere. The 
consideration in such cases is in the process of 
decision and not in its merits.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
25 (a) 2. Furthermore, this Court in the case State of NCT of Delhi 
v. Sanjeev (2-Judge Bench)6 elaborated on when judicial 
 
5 (2004) 9 SCC 362 
6 (2005) 5 SCC 181 

34 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
review should be exercised vis-à-vis decisions of the 
Government. It was observed: 
 
“16. If the power has been exercised on a non-
consideration or non-application of mind to relevant 
factors, the exercise of power will be regarded as 
manifestly erroneous. If a power (whether legislative 
or administrative) is exercised on the basis of facts 
which do not exist and which are patently erroneous, 
such exercise of power will stand vitiated. (See CIT v. 
Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. [(1983) 4 SCC 392 : 
1983 SCC (Tax) 336 : AIR 1984 SC 1182] 
17. The court will be slow to interfere in such 
matters relating to administrative functions unless 
decision is tainted by any vulnerability enumerated 
above; like illegality, irrationality and procedural 
impropriety. Whether action falls within any of the 
categories has to be established. Mere assertion in 
that regard would not be sufficient. 
x                 
 x           
  x               
  x        
         
21. In other words, to characterise a decision of 
the administrator as “irrational” the court has to hold, 
on material, that it is a decision “so outrageous” as to 
be in total defiance of logic or moral standards. 
Adoption of “proportionality” into administrative law 
was left for the future. 
22. These principles have been noted in the 
aforesaid terms in Union of India v. G. Ganayutham 
[(1997) 7 SCC 463 : 1997 SCC (L&S) 1806]. In 
essence, the test is to see whether there is any 
infirmity in the decision-making process and not in 
the decision itself. (See Indian Rly. Construction Co. 
Ltd. v. Ajay Kumar [(2003) 4 SCC 579 : 2003 SCC 
(L&S) 528].” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
25 (a) 3. The scope of this judicial review of administrative action 
was also discussed by this Court in Jagdish Mandal v. State 

35 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
of Orissa (2 - Judge Bench)7. In this case, the Court held that 
the purpose of judicial review is to check whether the decision 
has been made lawfully and not as to whether such decision 
is sound or not. 
 
25 (a) 4. This Court in Villianur Iyarkkai Padukappu Maiyam v. 
Union of India, (3-Judge Bench)8 observed that: 
 
“167. In the matter of policy decisions and economic 
tests the scope of judicial review is very limited. 
Unless the decision is shown to be contrary to any 
statutory provision or the Constitution, the Court 
would not interfere with an economic decision taken 
by the State. The court cannot examine the relative 
merits of different economic policies and cannot strike 
down the same merely on ground that another policy 
would have been fairer and better. 
 
… 
 
169. It is neither within the domain of the courts nor 
the scope of judicial review to embark upon an inquiry 
as to whether a particular public policy is wise or 
whether better public policy can be evolved. Nor are 
the courts inclined to strike down a policy at the 
behest of a petitioner merely because it has been 
urged that a different policy would have been fairer or 
wiser or more scientific or more logical. Wisdom and 
advisability of economic policy are ordinarily not 
amenable to judicial review. In matters relating to 
economic issues the Government has, while taking a 
decision, right to “trial and error” as long as both trial 
and error are bona fide and within the limits of the 
authority. For testing the correctness of a policy, the 
appropriate forum is Parliament and not the courts.

8 (2009) 7 SCC 561 

36 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
 
170. Normally, there is always a presumption that the 
governmental action is reasonable and in public 
interest and it is for the party challenging its validity 
to show that it is wanting in reasonableness or is not 
informed with public interest. This burden is a heavy 
one and it has to be discharged to the satisfaction of 
the court by proper and adequate material. The court 
cannot lightly assume that the action taken by the 
Government is unreasonable or against public 
interest because there are a large number of 
considerations, which necessarily weigh with the 
Government in taking an action.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
25 (a) 5. In Academy of Nutrition Improvement v. Union of India, 
(2-Judge Bench)9 where the challenge to iodised salt was 
made and it was reiterated that: 
 
“…. courts should not rush in where even scientists 
and medical experts are careful to tread. The rule of 
prudence is that courts will be reluctant to interfere 
with policy decisions taken by the Government, in 
matters of public health, after collecting and 
analysing inputs from surveys and research. Nor will 
courts attempt to substitute their own views as to 
what is wise, safe, prudent or proper, in relation to 
technical issues relating to public health in 
preference of those formulated by persons said to 
possess technical expertise and rich experience.”

25 (a) 6. A similar view was taken in Lafarge Umiam Mining (P) Ltd. 
v. Union of India (3-Judge Bench)10, wherein this Court 
observed: 
 
“119. The time has come for us to apply the 
constitutional “doctrine of proportionality” to the 
matters concerning environment as a part of the 
process of judicial review in contradistinction to merit 
review. It cannot be gainsaid that utilisation of the 
environment and its natural resources has to be in a 
way that is consistent with principles of sustainable 
development 
and 
intergenerational 
equity, 
but 
balancing of these equities may entail policy choices. 
In the circumstances, barring exceptions, decisions 
relating to utilisation of natural resources have to be 
tested on the anvil of the well-recognised principles of 
judicial review. Have all the relevant factors been 
taken into account? Have any extraneous factors 
influenced the decision? Is the decision strictly in 
accordance with the legislative policy underlying the 
law (if any) that governs the field? Is the decision 
consistent 
with 
the 
principles 
of 
sustainable 
development in the sense that has the decision-maker 
taken into account the said principle and, on the 
basis of relevant considerations, arrived at a balanced 
decision? Thus, the Court should review the decision-
making process to ensure that the decision of MoEF 
is fair and fully informed, based on the correct 
principles, and free from any bias or restraint. Once 
this is ensured, then the doctrine of “margin of 
appreciation” in favour of the decision-maker would 
come into play.”

10 (2011) 7 SCC 338 

38 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
25 (a) 7. Recently in Jacob Puliyel v. Union of India and Ors.11 (2-
Judge Bench), while considering the vaccination policy due 
to COVID-19, this Court reiterated the scope of judicial review 
with policy decisions of the executive. Arbitrariness, 
irrationality, perversity and mala fide will render the policy 
unconstitutional. Relying on Delhi Development Authority 
v. Joint Action Committee, Allottee of SFS Flats (2-Judge 
Bench)12, this Court explained that a policy decisions can be 
subject to judicial review (a) if it is unconstitutional; (b) if it is 
dehors the provisions of the Act and the regulations; (c) if the 
delegatee has acted beyond its powers of delegation; (d) if the 
executive policy is contrary to the statutory or a larger policy. 
It was further stated: 
 
“22. This Court in a series of decisions has reiterated 
that courts should not rush in where even scientists 
and medical experts are careful to tread. The rule of 
prudence is that courts will be reluctant to interfere 
with policy decisions taken by the Government, in 
matters of public health, after collecting and 
analysing inputs from surveys and research. Nor will 
courts attempt to substitute their own views as to 
what is wise, safe, prudent or proper, in relation to 
technical issues relating to public health in 
preference to those formulated by persons said to 
possess technical expertise and rich experience.

12 (2007) 4 SCC 737 

39 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
Where expertise of a complex nature is expected of the 
State in framing rules, the exercise of that power not 
demonstrated as arbitrary must be presumed to be 
valid as a reasonable restriction on the fundamental 
right of the citizen and judicial review must halt at the 
frontiers. The Court cannot re-weigh and substitute 
its notion of expedient solution.” 
 
 
25 (a) 8. A perusal of the above decisions makes clear two important 
factors. It is evident that judicial review so far as economic or 
policy matters is concerned is circumscribed but at the same 
time it is also apparent that the scope of the possibility of the 
Court’s intervention has been expanded over time. The 
generally accepted yardstick would be that the merits of a 
decision are ordinarily not examined to accommodate the 
possibility of a better alternative nor does it scuttle the 
government’s ability to achieve the best outcome through trial 
and error but at the same time if any of the decisions made 
are such that the vires of the process would be affected or in 
other words, that the decision taken is compromised in regard 
to the manner in which it was arrived at, then, the Courts 
would be within terms to exercise its jurisdiction of judicial 
review.  
 

40 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
25 (a) 9. Keeping in mind the above standard of judicial review, I now 
proceed to examine the first issue at hand.  
 
25 (a) 10. Adverting to the first contention, the Petitioners have 
sought to place reliance on the judgment of this Court in 
Kantha Vibhag Yuva Koli Samaj Parivartan Trust v. State 
of Gujarat (2-Judge Bench)13, wherein this Court while 
considering the functions of the NGT observed:  
 
“16. Sections 
14 
and 
Section 
15 
entrust 
adjudicatory functions to the NGT. The NGT is a 
specialized body comprising of judicial and expert 
members. Judicial members bring to bear their 
experience in adjudicating cases. On the other hand, 
expert members bring into the decision-making process 
scientific 
knowledge 
on 
issues 
concerning 
the 
environment. In Hanuman Laxman Aroskar v. Union 
of India (2019) 15 SCC 401, a two-Judge Bench of this 
Court noted that the NGT is an expert adjudicatory body 
on the environment. The Court held: 
 
“133. The NGT Act provides for the constitution of 
a tribunal consisting both of judicial and expert members. 
The mix of judicial and technical members envisaged by 
the statute is for the reason that the Tribunal is called 
upon to consider questions which involve the application 
and assessment of science and its interface with the 
environment… 
134. NGT is an expert adjudicatory body on the 
environment.” 
 
 
13 2022 SCC Online SC 120 

41 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
17. The NGT does not have a dearth of ‘expertise’ 
when it comes to the issues of environment. 
18. Section 15 empowers the NGT to award 
compensation to the victims of pollution and for 
environmental damage, to provide for restitution of 
property which has been damaged and for the 
restitution of the environment. The NGT cannot abdicate 
its jurisdiction by entrusting these core adjudicatory 
functions to administrative expert committees. Expert 
committees may be appointed to assist the NGT in the 
performance of its task and as an adjunct to its fact-
finding role.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
25 (a) 11. This decision has come to be followed by this Court in 
Singrauli Super Thermal Power Station v. Ashwani Kumar 
Dubey (2-Judge Bench)14.  
 
25 (a) 12. Keeping in view of the above, what this Court must 
examine is whether in the appointment and acceptance of the 
recommendation of the expert committee, the GEAC has 
delegated its core function, in view of the 1989 Rules. 
 
25 (a) 13. Under the 1989 Rules, the GEAC functioning as a body 
under the Department of Environment, Forests and Wildlife 
has been made responsible for approval of proposals relating 
to release of genetically engineered organisms and products 
 
14 (2023) 8 SCC 35 

42 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
into the environment including experimental field trials. 
Therefore, the primary function that has been given to the 
GEAC, is this process of granting approvals. The composition 
of this Committee, along with representatives from different 
departments of the executive, has to include three outside 
experts in individual capacity.  
 
25 (a) 14. On a perusal of the timeline for conditional approval of 
DMH-11, the GEAC has constituted a sub-committee and 
expert committee respectively, in its 126th and 146th meeting, 
with a specific purpose on each occasion. In my considered 
view, this cannot be said to be delegating its core function. 
  
25 (a) 15. In Kantha Vibhag Yuva Koli Samaj (supra), which the 
Petitioners place reliance on, the body involved, i.e., the NGT 
exercises judicial functions, which is clearly distinct from the 
GEAC which is responsible for granting approvals for the 
release of GMOs and not performing any quasi-judicial 
function. Therefore, it cannot be said that the exposition in 
the above case, applies squarely to the case at hand.  
 

43 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
25 (a) 16. Furthermore, in the said decision, it was explicitly stated 
in paragraph 22 that “expert committees may be appointed to 
assist the NGT in the performance of its task and as an adjunct 
to its fact-finding role”. In my view, this is squarely, the 
function performed by the sub-committee/expert committee 
constituted by the GEAC, i.e., assistance in granting 
approvals.  
 
25 (a) 17. The present factual circumstance is not a case, where the 
approval process itself has been delegated to the sub-
committee/expert committee. A specific purpose was set out 
for the committee, on which a report was submitted back to 
the GEAC. Illustratively, the mandate of the expert committee 
may be referred to, the relevant extract is as under: 
 
“…In accordance with the decision taken in the 
aforementioned meeting of the GEAC, the Expert 
Committee has been constituted to examine the claim 
of CGMCP, University of Delhi in respect of 
availability of adequate evidence about impact of 
transgenic mustard on honey bees and other 
pollinators, in order to assess the need for conducting 
field demonstration studies on honeybees and other 
pollinators.” 
 
 

44 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
25 (a) 18. It is evident from the above extract that the expert 
committee was constituted for a limited purpose and was only 
a part of the larger decision-making process.  On the perusal 
of said report and other materials, the impugned decision 
came to be passed.  
 
25 (a) 19. As submitted on behalf of Union of India, a Constitution 
Bench of this Court in State of U.P. v. Batuk Deo Pati 
Tripathi (5-Judge Bench)15 expounded that: 
 
“10… The power to do a thing necessarily carries with 
it the power to regulate the manner in which the thing 
may be done. It is an incident of the power itself and 
indeed, without it, the exercise of the power may in 
practice be fraught with difficulties which will 
frustrate, rather than further, the object of the power. 
It is undoubtedly true that the rules framed for 
prescribing the manner in which a power may be 
exercised have to be truly regulatory in character.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
25 (a) 20. This decision was followed in Khargram Panchayat 
Samiti v. State of West Bengal (2-Judge Bench)16, wherein 
it was observed: 
 
“5…. It had earlier been laid down by a Constitution 
Bench in the case of State of U.P. v. Batuk Deo Pati 
 
15 (1978) 2 SCC 102 
16 (1987) 3 SCC 82 

45 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
Tripathi [(1978) 2 SCC 102 : 1978 SCC (L & S) 147] 
that a power to do a thing necessarily carries with it 
the power to regulate the manner in which the thing 
may be done. The High Court failed to appreciate that 
the power to grant a licence for the holding of a hat or 
fair under Section 117 of the Act necessarily carries 
with it the power to specify a day on which such hat 
or fair shall be held. Such power to specify a day must 
be held to be a power incidental to or consequential 
upon the principal power of issuing a licence under 
Section 117 of the Act for holding of a hat or fair. The 
Rules or the absence of it do not detract from the 
substantive power conferred by a statute.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
25 (a) 21. Applying the above observations of this Court, would 
mean that the power of the GEAC, to grant approvals, 
necessarily carries with it the power to regulate the manner, 
in which the approvals are so granted. The mere absence of a 
specific statement in the 1989 Rules allowing assistance of 
expert committees, would not preclude the GEAC from doing 
so, in furtherance of its main objective.  
 
25 (a) 22. Reference must also be made to the decision of this Court 
in Inspector General of Registration v. K. Baskaran (2-
Judge Bench)17, wherein after consideration of a number of 
judgments concluded as under: 
 
 
17 (2020) 14 SCC 345 

46 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
“14. The following principles can thus be culled out 
from the decisions of this Court: (i) A statutory 
functionary exercising a power cannot be said to have 
delegated his functions merely by deputing a 
responsible and competent official to enquire and 
report, as that is the ordinary mode of exercise of any 
administrative power; (ii) If a statutory authority 
empowers a delegate to undertake preparatory work, 
and to take an initial decision in matters entrusted to 
it, but retains in its own hands the power to approve 
or disapprove the decision after it has been taken, the 
decision will be held to have been validly made if the 
degree of control maintained by the authority is close 
enough for the decision to be regarded as the 
authority's own; (iii) Even in cases of sub-delegation, 
so long as the essential function of decision-making 
is performed by the delegate, the burden of 
performing the ancillary and clerical task need not be 
shouldered by the primary delegate and it is not 
necessary that the primary delegate himself should 
perform the ministerial acts as well; and (iv) Practical 
necessities or exigencies of administration require 
that the decision-making authority who has been 
conferred with statutory power, be able to delegate 
tasks when the situation so requires.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
25 (a) 23. Therefore, in view of the above conspectus, the decision of 
the GEAC cannot be said to be vitiated by delegation. 
 
25 (b) 1. Another challenge that has been laid by the Petitioners to 
the impugned decision, is non-application of mind. In my 
considered view, this submission does not stand. 
 
25 (b) 2. The expert committee appointed in the 146th meeting of 
the GEAC dated 25.08.2022, submitted its report and a reading 

47 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
of the same would show that a barnase/barstar proteins 
introduced in GE Mustard are not novel to honeybees and thus 
they do not discriminate between GE and non GE canola, it 
further relied on data collected from Canada and Australia. 
Pursuant to which it recommended the environmental release of 
GE Mustard. The conditional approval granted vide letter dated 
08.10.2022 of the MoEFCC shows that the approval so granted 
was on the basis of multiple documents and not only the 
comments of the expert committee, as alleged by the Petitioners. 
Considering the importance of the issue, the potential magnitude 
of its (the decision of the GEAC’s) impact, it was found prudent by 
the decision-making authority to call for the comments of the 
Department of Biotechnology (received on 01.08.2022) and the 
Department of Agricultural Research and Education (received on 
30.07.2022), which are departments under their respective 
Ministries. It would be apposite to briefly advert to their mission, 
roles, responsibilities and mandates. 
 
Department of Biotechnology under the Ministry of Science and 
Technology: 
 
“Mission 

48 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
…The Department shall provide services in the areas 
of research, infrastructure, generation of human 
resource, popularization of biotechnology, promotion 
of industries, creation of centers of excellence, 
implementation of biosafety guidelines for genetically 
modified organisms and recombinant DNA products 
and 
biotechnology-based 
programs 
for 
societal 
benefits. Bioinformatics is a major mission to 
establish an information network for the scientific 
community, nationally and internationally. 
 
Mandate 
… 
• Promote large scale use of Biotechnology 
• Support R&D and manufacturing in Biology 
… 
• Serve as Nodal Point for specific International 
Collaborations 
• Establishment of Infrastructure Facilities to support 
R&D and production 
… 
• Evolve Bio Safety Guidelines, manufacture and 
application of cell based vaccines 
• Serve as nodal point for the collection and 
dissemination 
of 
information 
relating 
to 
biotechnology.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
Department of Agricultural Research and Education under the 
Ministry of Agriculture 
 
“About the Departments 
… 
DARE provides the necessary government linkages for 
the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), 
the premier research organisation for co-ordinating, 
guiding and managing research and education in 

49 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
agriculture including horticulture, fisheries and 
animal sciences in the entire country. With over 97 
ICAR institutes, 53 agricultural universities, 6 
Bureaux, 18 National Research Centres, 25 Project 
Directorates, and 89 All India Coordinated Research 
Projects spread across the country this is one of the 
largest national agricultural research systems in the 
world. 
Mission  
Interfacing agricultural research and technology, 
higher education and frontline extension initiatives 
with institutional, infrastructural and policy support 
for sustainable growth of agriculture. 
Major Functions  
• To look after all aspects of the agricultural research 
and Education (including horticulture, natural 
resources management, agriculture engineering, 
agricultural extension, animal science, economic 
statistics and marketing and fisheries) involving 
coordination between the central and state agencies. 
• To attend all matters relating to Indian Council of 
Agricultural Research. 
• To attend all matters concerning the development of 
new technology in agriculture, horticulture, natural 
resources management, agriculture engineering, 
agricultural extension, animal science, economic 
statistics and marketing and fisheries, including such 
functions as plant and animal introduction and 
exploration and soil and land use survey and 
planning. 
• International co-operation in the field of agricultural 
research and education including relations with 
foreign and international agricultural research and 
educational institutions and organizations, including 
participation 
in 
international 
conferences, 
associations 
and 
other 
bodies 
dealing 
with 
agricultural research and education and follow-up 
decisions at such international conferences etc. 
• Fundamental, applied and operational research and 
higher education including co-ordination of such 
research 
and 
higher 
education 
in 
agriculture 
including agro forestry, animal husbandry, dairying, 

50 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
fisheries, agricultural statistics, economics and 
marketing.” 
 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
 
 
25 (b) 3. Taking in consideration all the above aspects, one cannot 
possibly fault the GEAC in asking for the opinion and 
understanding of these two departments. Having so received their 
comments, an expert committee within the GEAC was formed to 
evaluate the presence/absence of sufficient literature regarding 
the effect of GM crops on honeybees, exemption from further trial 
for which, was sought by the applicant. This Committee then, also 
considered such comments and gave its finding, in conformity 
with the mandate given to it.   
 
25 (b) 4. Also, it is to be noted that the conditional release of DMH-
11 was made subject to several conditions including, among 
others, that the MoEFCC/GEAC may impose further conditions 
as may be necessary. Such conditions include the revocation of 
approval in case adverse impact is shown on environment or 
human health; it is made subject to other statutory clearances 
including the clearance from Food Safety and Standards 
Authority of India, Seeds Act. Additionally, it imposes certain 

51 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
obligations on the applicant including obligation to inform 
regulatory bodies as soon as any adverse impact is shown; 
obligation to submit annual/seasonal report of the yield etc. to 
the GEAC.  
25 (b) 5. Therefore, the contentions that the primary function of the 
GEAC has been delegated to the expert committee and that it was 
granted without application of mind is sufficiently contravened by 
record. In that view of the matter, the conditional approval of 
DMH-11 granted by the GEAC, is upheld as being independent, 
reasoned and in consonance with the rules.  
 
Constitutionality of the 1989 Rules 
 
26. The Petitioners have also laid challenge to the constitutional 
validity of the 1989 Rules on the ground that they are violative of 
Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The primary 
prong of this attack is that the constitution of the GEAC, in the 
submission of the Petitioners is lopsided with bureaucratic 
influence with the same being evidenced by the top three positions 
therein being occupied by such persons. Before delving into the 
substance of the challenge, it would be apposite to appreciate 

52 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
certain pronouncements of this Court wherein such challenges 
were adjudicated.  
26.1. In the landmark case of E.P. Royappa v. State of T.N. 18 (5-
Judge Bench), this Court while dealing with Article 14 and 
Article 16 observed that : 
 
"In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; 
one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the 
other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute 
monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it 
that it is unequal both according to political logic and 
constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 
14, and if it effects any matter relating to public 
employment, it is also violative of Article 16. Articles 
14 and 16 strike at arbitrariness in State action and 
ensure fairness and equality of treatment. They 
require that State action must be based on valid 
relevant principles applicable alike to all similarly 
situate and it must not be guided by any extraneous 
or irrelevant considerations because that would be 
denial of equality. Where the operative reason for 
State action, as distinguished from motive inducing 
from the antechamber of the mind, is not legitimate 
and relevant but is extraneous and outside the area 
of permissible considerations, it would amount to 
mala fide exercise of power and that is hit by Articles 
14 and 16. Mala fide exercise of power and 
arbitrariness are different lethal radiations emanating 
from the same vice: in fact the latter comprehends the 
former. Both are inhibited by Articles 14 and 16.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
18 (1974) 4 SCC 3 

53 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
26.2. On similar lines, in State of T. N. & Ors. v. Ananthi Ammal19 
(3-Judge Bench) this Court observed: 
 
“7. When a statute is impugned under Article 14 what 
the court has to decide is whether the statute is so 
arbitrary or unreasonable that it must be struck 
down. At best, a statute upon a similar subject which 
derives its authority from another source can be 
referred to, if its provisions have been held to be 
reasonable or have stood the test of time, only for the 
purpose of indicating what may be said to be 
reasonable in the context...” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
26.3. Furthermore, in State of A.P. v. McDowell & Co.,20 (3-Judge 
Bench), this Court observed that the restrictions on the law-
making power of legislatures is similar to those under the 
Federal Constitution of the United States of America. The two 
grounds on which a law made by the Parliament or the 
legislature can be struck down are - (1) lack of legislative 
competence; and (2) violation of any of the fundamental rights 
guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution or of any other 
constitutional provision. There is no third ground. It held: 
 
 
19 (1995) 1 SCC 519 
20 (1996) 3 SCC 709 

54 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
“43. … The main criticism against the ground of 
substantive due process being that it seeks to set up 
the courts as arbiters of the wisdom of the legislature 
in enacting the particular piece of legislation. It is 
enough for us to say that by whatever name it is 
characterised, the ground of invalidation must fall 
within the four corners of the two grounds mentioned 
above. In other words, say, if an enactment is 
challenged as violative of Article 14, it can be struck 
down only if it is found that it is violative of the 
equality clause/equal protection clause enshrined 
therein. Similarly, if an enactment is challenged as 
violative of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed 
by sub-clauses (a) to (g) of Article 19(1), it can be 
struck down only if it is found not saved by any of the 
clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19 and so on. No enactment 
can be struck down by just saying that it is arbitrary 
or unreasonable. Some or other constitutional 
infirmity has to be found before invalidating an Act. 
An enactment cannot be struck down on the ground 
that the court thinks it unjustified. Parliament and 
the legislatures, composed as they are of the 
representatives of the people, are supposed to know 
and be aware of the needs of the people and what is 
good and bad for them. The court cannot sit in 
judgment over their wisdom. In this connection, it 
should be remembered that even in the case of 
administrative action, the scope of judicial review is 
limited to three grounds, viz., (i) unreasonableness, 
which can more appropriately be called irrationality, 
(ii) illegality and (iii) procedural impropriety.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
26.4. In Onkar Lal Bajaj v. Union of India21 (2-Judge Bench), it 
was held: 
 
“27. Article 14 guarantees to everyone equality before 
law. Unequals cannot be clubbed. The proposition is 
well settled and does not require reference to any 
precedent though many decisions were cited. 
 
21 (2003) 2 SCC 673 

55 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
Likewise, an arbitrary exercise of executive power 
deserves to be quashed, is a proposition which again 
does not require support of any precedent. It is 
equally well settled that an order passed without 
application of mind deserves to be annulled being an 
arbitrary exercise of power. At the same time, we have 
no difficulty in accepting the proposition urged on 
behalf of the Government that if two views are 
possible and the Government takes one of it, it would 
not be amenable to judicial review on the ground that 
the other view, according to the court, is a better 
view.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
26.5. In 5 M & T Consultants v. S.Y. Nawab (2-Judge 
Bench)22  this Court reiterated the principle given in Delhi 
Science Forum v. Union of India (3-Judge Bench)23  wherein 
it was observed: 
 
“…parting with privilege exclusively vested with the 
Government must be reasonably rational and in the 
public interest besides conforming to law governing 
the same and the decision pertaining to the same can 
be questioned only on grounds of bad faith,  being 
based on irrational or irrelevant considerations, non-
compliance with the prescribed procedure or violation 
of any constitutional or statutory provision and the 
onus in respect of establishing the same not only 
heavily rests on the person alleging it but it is not 
satisfied by merely raising a doubt in the mind of the 
Court as to the validity of the decision.”

23 (1996) 2 SCC 405 

56 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
26.6. In order to declare a legislation violative of Article 14 of the 
Constitution of India, arbitrariness on the part of the 
legislature should, ordinarily, be manifest arbitrariness, as has 
been held by this Court in Bombay Dyeing & Mfg. Co. Ltd. 
(3) v. Bombay Environmental Action Group (2-Judge 
Bench)24.  
 
26.7. Similarly, in A.P. Dairy Development Corpn. Federation v. 
B. Narasimha Reddy, (2-Judge Bench)25, this Court held that 
substantive unreasonableness should be shown in the statute 
itself in order to declare it ultra vires the Constitution. It has 
been held that 
 
“A party has to satisfy that the action was reasonable, 
not done in unreasonable manner or capriciously or 
at pleasure without adequate determining principle, 
rational, and has been done according to reason or 
judgment, and certainly does not depend on the will 
alone. However, the action of the legislature, violative 
of Article 14 of the Constitution, should ordinarily be 
manifestly arbitrary.”  
 
 
26.8. The principle that to declare an Act ultra vires under Article 
14, the Court must be satisfied in respect of substantive

unreasonableness in the statute itself stood reiterated by this 
Court in State of T.N. v. K. Shyam Sunder (3-Judge 
Bench)26. 
 
26.9. Recently, this Court in Association for Democratic Reforms 
& Anr v. Union of India & Ors. (5-Judge Bench)27, while 
relying on Dharam Dutt v. Union of India (2-Judge Bench)28 
extensively discussed this principle. It held as follows: 
 
“44. The presumption of constitutionality is based on 
two premises. First, it is based on democratic 
accountability, 
that 
is, 
legislators 
are 
elected 
representatives who are aware of the needs of the 
citizens and are best placed to frame policies to 
resolve them. Second, legislators are privy to 
information necessary for policy making which the 
Courts as an adjudicating authority are not. However, 
the policy underlying the legislation must not violate 
the freedoms and rights which are entrenched in Part 
III of the Constitution and other constitutional 
provisions. It is for this reason that previous 
judgments of this Court have held that the 
presumption of constitutionality is rebutted when a 
prima facie case of violation of a fundamental right is 
established. The onus then shifts on the State to 
prove that the violation of the fundamental right is 
justified.”

58 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
26.10. A perusal of the judgments referred to supra shows two 
primary grounds upon which the validity of a legislation or, in 
our case Rules made under a legislation, may be put to 
challenge. One is legislative competence and the second is 
manifest arbitrariness. The former is not an aspect of 
challenge. In view of S.6 (rules to regulate environmental 
pollution), S.8 (persons handling hazardous substances to 
comply with procedural safeguards) and S.25 (empowers the 
Central Government for making rules to carry out the purposes 
of the EPA) of the EPA 1986, 1989 Rules were made to protect 
the environment, nature and health, in connection with the 
application of gene-technology and micro-organisms. 
26.11. The latter, that is manifest arbitrariness, has been 
recognized as a ground upon which a legislative enactment can 
be judicially reviewed. [See: K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of 
India (5-Judge Bench)29 and Madras Bar Association v. 
Union of India & Anr. (3-Judge Bench)30] Equally, it is to be 
noticed that in Indian Express Newspaper v. Union of India 
 
29 (2019) 1 SCC 1 
30 (2022) 12 SCC 455 

59 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
(3-Judge Bench)31 it was stated that subordinate legislation 
can be challenged on any ground available against the plenary 
legislation. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
distinction 
between 
subordinate and plenary legislation is erased when it comes to 
a challenge under Article 14 of the Constitution of India.  
 
26.12. In Khoday Distilleries Ltd. v. State of Karnataka (3-Judge 
Bench)32, this Court held : 
 
“13. It is next submitted before us that the amended 
Rules are arbitrary, unreasonable and cause undue 
hardship and, therefore, violate Article 14 of the 
Constitution. Although the protection of Article 
19(1)(g) may not be available to the appellants, the 
Rules must, undoubtedly, satisfy the test of Article 
14, which is a guarantee against arbitrary action. 
However, one must bear in mind that what is being 
challenged here under Article 14 is not executive 
action but delegated legislation. The tests of arbitrary 
action which apply to executive actions do not 
necessarily apply to delegated legislation. In order 
that delegated legislation can be struck down, such 
legislation must be manifestly arbitrary; a law which 
could not be reasonably expected to emanate from an 
authority delegated with the law-making power. In 
Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) (P) Ltd. v. 
Union of India [(1985) 1 SCC 641 : 1985 SCC (Tax) 
121], this Court said that a piece of subordinate 
legislation does not carry the same degree of 
immunity which is enjoyed by a statute passed by a 
competent legislature. A subordinate legislation may 
be questioned under Article 14 on the ground that it 
is unreasonable; ‘unreasonable not in the sense of not 
being reasonable, but in the sense that it is manifestly 
 
31 (1985) 1 SCC 641 
32 (1996) 10 SCC 304 

60 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
arbitrary’. Drawing a comparison between the law in 
England and in India, the Court further observed that 
in England the Judges would say, ‘Parliament never 
intended the authority to make such Rules; they are 
unreasonable and ultra vires’. In India, arbitrariness 
is not a separate ground since it will come within the 
embargo of Article 14 of the Constitution. But 
subordinate legislation must be so arbitrary that it 
could not be said to be in conformity with the statute 
or that it offends Article 14 of the Constitution.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
26.13. In Shayara Bano v. Union of India & Ors. (5-Judge 
Bench)33, RF Nariman J., while dissenting with the majority, 
observed : 
 
“Manifest arbitrariness, therefore, must be something 
done by the legislature capriciously, irrationally 
and/or without adequate determining principle. Also, 
when something is done which is excessive and 
disproportionate, 
such 
legislation 
would 
be 
manifestly arbitrary.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
26.14. Neither in the limited pleadings made before this Court nor 
in the extensive oral arguments advanced was the point of the 
rules 
being 
allegedly 
manifestly 
arbitrary, 
addressed 
adequately. On an independent analysis, I am unable to find 
any of the aspects of manifest arbitrariness to have been met, 
much less on the ground that bureaucratic influence taints the 
 
33 (2017) 9 SCC 1 

61 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
functioning of the GEAC. This aspect further stands amplified 
herein, later.  
 
27. On a further count, this challenge, in my view fails. The 1989 
Rules present a well-rounded mechanism to deal with GMOs and 
their introduction into fields of common usage. 
 
27.1. Rule 4 of the 1989 Rules provide for the six different competent 
authorities to oversee the research and regulations in the field 
of GMOs, whose functions are elaborated herein.   
 
i. Recombinant 
DNA 
Advisory 
Committee 
(RDAC) 
is 
responsible to review developments in Biotechnology at 
national and international levels and recommend safety 
regulations in recombinant research, use and applications 
from time to time.  
ii. The 
committee 
- 
Review 
Committee 
on 
Genetic 
Manipulation (RCGM) - is made responsible to monitor the 
safety related aspect in respect of on-going research projects 
and 
activities 
involving 
genetically 
engineered 
organisms/hazardous microorganisms. It is further tasked 
with bringing out manuals of guidelines specifying procedure 

62 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
for regulatory process with respect to activities involving GMOs 
in research, use and applications including industry with a 
view to ensure environmental safety. They are responsible to 
review all ongoing projects involving high risk category and 
controlled field experiments and to ensure that adequate 
precautions and containment conditions are followed as per 
the guidelines.  
iii 
Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC) - They are given 
the responsibility to assist the occupier or any person 
(including 
research 
institutions 
handling 
microorganisms/genetically 
engineered 
organisms) 
in 
preparing an up to date on site emergency plan according to 
the manuals/guidelines of the RCGM and make available 
copies to the DLC/SBCC and the GEAC. 
iv. Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) - This 
committee is constituted for approval of activities involving 
large 
scale 
use 
of 
hazardous 
microorganisms 
and 
recombinants in research and industrial production from the 
environmental angle. It shall be responsible for approval of 
proposals relating to release of genetically engineered 

63 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
organisms and products into the environment including 
experimental field trials. The committee or any person 
authorised by it, is empowered to take punitive action under 
the EPA, 1986. 
v. State Biotechnology Co-Ordination Committee (SBCC) - At 
State level, this Committee has powers to inspect, investigate 
and take punitive action in case of violations of statutory 
provisions. It shall also periodically review the safety and 
control measures in various industries/institutions handling 
genetically engineered organisms/hazardous microorganisms. 
vi. District Level Committee (DLC) - At the district level, in order 
to supervise the safety measures, this Committee is 
constituted wherever necessary under the District Collectors 
to monitor the safety regulations in installations engaged in 
the 
use 
of 
genetically 
modified 
organisms/hazardous 
microorganisms and its applications in the environment. It 
shall visit the installation engaged in activity involving 
genetically engineered organisms, hazardous microorganisms, 
formulate information chart, find out hazards and risks 
associated with each of these installations and coordinate 

64 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
activities with a view to meeting any emergency. This 
Committee 
shall 
regularly 
submit 
its 
report 
to 
the 
SBCC/GEAC. 
 
27.2. Rule 7 of the 1989 Rules deals with approval and prohibitions. 
It reads thus: 
 
“(1) No person shall import, export, transport, 
manufacture, process, use or sell any hazardous 
microorganisms 
or 
genetically 
engineered 
organisms/substances or cells except with the 
approval of the Genetic Engineering Approval 
Committee.  
 
(2) Use of pathogenic microorganism or any 
genetically engineered organisms or cell for the 
purpose of research shall only be allowed in 
laboratories or inside laboratory areas notified by the 
Ministry of Environment and Forests for this purpose 
under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.  
 
(3) The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee shall 
give directions to the occupier to determine or take 
measures concerning the discharge of micro-
organisms/genetically engineered organisms or cells 
mentioned in the schedule from the laboratories, 
hospitals and other areas including prohibition of 
such discharges and laying down measures to be 
taken to prevent such discharges.  
 
(4) Any person operating or using genetically 
engineered organism microorganisms mentioned in 
the schedule for scale up or pilot operations shall 
have to obtain licence issued by the Genetic 
Engineering Approval Committee for any such 
activity. The possessor shall have to apply for licence 
in prescribed proforma. 
 

65 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
(5) Certain experiments for the purpose of education 
within the field of gene technology or microorganism 
may be carried out outside the laboratories and 
laboratory areas mentioned in subrule (2) and will be 
looked 
after 
by 
the 
Institutional 
Biosafety 
Committee.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
27.3. Rule 10 states that except with the approval GEAC, no 
substances and products containing genetically engineered 
organisms or cells or microorganisms shall be produced, sold, 
imported or used. 
 
27.4. Rule 12 provides for guidelines wherein person who applies for 
approval under the Rules 8-11 is obligated to submit 
information and make examinations or cause examinations to 
be made to elucidate its case, including examinations 
according to specific directions and at specific laboratories. 
Before obtaining the approval, it is his responsibility to make 
available an on-site emergency plan to the GEAC. Further, an 
obligation is imposed upon the person to whom an approval 
has been granted, to notify the GEAC of any change in or 
addition to the information already submitted. 
 
 

66 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
27.5. Rule 13 provides for grant of approval and the same is 
reproduced herein: 
 
“(1) In connection with the granting of approval under 
rules 8 to 11 above, terms and conditions shall be 
stipulated, including terms and conditions as to the 
control to be excercised by the applicant, supervision, 
restriction on use, the layout of the enterprise and as 
to the submission of information to the State 
Biotechnology Co-ordination Committee or to the 
District Level Committee  
 
(2) All approvals of the Genetic Engineering Approval 
Committee shall be for a specified period not 
exceeding four years at the first instance renewable 
for 2 years at a time. The Genetic Engineering 
Approval Committee shall have powers to revoke such 
approval in the following situations:  
 
(a) If there is any new information as to the harmful 
effects of the genetically engineered organisms or 
cells.  
 
(b) If the genetically engineered organisms or cells 
cause such damage to the environment, nature or 
health as could not be envisaged when the approval 
was given, or  
 
(c) Non compliance of any condition stipulated by 
Genetic Engineering Approval Committee.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
27.6. Rule 14 deals with general supervision of GEAC in the 
implementation of the terms and conditions laid down in 
connection with the approvals accorded by it and such 
supervision could be carried out through the SBCC or the State 

67 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
Pollution Control Boards/DLC or through any person 
authorised in this behalf. 
 
27.7. Rule 15 deals with penalties which can be imposed. It reads as: 
 
“(1) If an order is not complied with, the District Level 
Committee or State Biotechnology Coordination 
Committee may take measures at the expenses of the 
person who is responsible. 
 
 (2) In cases where immediate interventions is 
required in order to prevent any damage to the 
environment, nature or health, the District level 
Committee or State Biotechnology Coordination 
Committee may take the necessary steps without 
issuing any orders or notice. The expenses incurred 
for this purpose will be repayable by the person 
responsible for such damage. 
  
(3) The State Biotechnology Co-ordination Committee 
/District Level Committee may take samples for a 
more detailed examination of organisms and cells.  
 
(4)The 
State 
Biotechnology 
Co-ordination 
Committee/District 
Level 
Committee 
shall 
be 
competent to ask for assistance from any other 
Government authority to carry out its instructions.” 
 
 
27.8. Rule 19, as noted above, provides for mechanism of appeal from 
the decision of GEAC. 
 
27.9. The above extracted rules, as is evident lay down a clear 
mandate for functioning in respect of approvals that are to be 
granted by the GEAC. All aspects of immediate relevance are 

68 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
covered thereunder, i.e., the monitoring of safety regulations, 
preparing on-site emergency plans, research, inspection, 
release, penalties, use and approval with respect to 
GMOs/hazardous microorganisms/cells. The existence of 
various committees with certain, specified responsibilities, 
their composition; the providing of procedure for the most 
essential function which is the grant of approvals; appeals on 
being dissatisfied therefrom (grant or denial) shows that each 
body within the Rules has a role to play and the fate of an 
application is not solely in the hands of one body. In none of 
these Rules could I find even the slightest hint of manifest 
arbitrariness. None of the parts of the Rules can be said to be 
irrational, capricious or without adequate determining 
principle, on the contrary, as displayed, a clear rationale is 
discernible.  
 
27.10. In particular, the primary ground of challenge by the 
Petitioner as noticed above must be addressed. To do so, notice 
must also be taken of the Union of India’s submission that it is 
mandatory for all expert/members/Government officials of 

69 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
GEAC and RCGM to sign a declaration of independence, 
confirming that they have no involvement or financial interest 
in the development, promotion or commercialisation of 
GM/transgenic crops. Members are also required to inform the 
RCGM and GEAC in case they have a conflict of interest, in 
such cases, the member involved does not participate in the 
deliberations.  It has to be said that the composition of one of 
the Committees framed under the Rules allegedly suffering 
from some infirmity is not sufficient ground in the least, to 
vitiate the Rules on the whole. At the same time, it is also 
recognised that the GEAC is the apex body and its constitution 
therefrom assumes importance. Therefore, if the Petitioners 
had any qualms about its members, their objections should 
have been limited only thereto. As a secondary aide, a sweeping 
submission has been made that the 1989 Rules violates the 
Precautionary Principle however, how that is so is yet unclear. 
 
27.11. Adverting particularly to the composition of the GEAC, the 
relevant rule reads as under: 
 
 

70 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
“The composition of the Committee shall be  
i. 
Chairman-Additional 
Secretary, 
Department 
of 
Environment, Forests and Wild life  
Co-Chairman-Representative 
of 
Department 
of 
Bio-
technology  
 
ii. Members: Representative of concerned Agencies and 
Departments, namely, Ministry of Industrial Development, 
Department of Biotechnology and the Department of Atomic 
Energy. 
 
iii. Expert members: Director General Indian Council of 
Agricultural Research, Director General-Indian Council of 
Medical Research, Director General-Council of Scientific 
and Industrial Research, Director General-Health Services, 
Plant Protection Adviser, Directorate of Plant Protection, 
Quarantine and storage, Chairman, Central Pollution 
Control Board and three outside experts in individual 
capacity.  
 
iv. Member Secretary: An official of the Department or 
Environment, Forest and Wild life.  
 
The committee may co-opt other members/experts as 
necessary.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
27.12. It is evident that the top position in the GEAC is occupied by 
a person of the rank of Additional Secretary to the Government 
of India and the Vice Chairman is the member of the 
Department of Biotechnology, however, other members such as 
in Clause (iii) while being Government employees, possibly are 
still members working in specialized departments whose 
knowledge and expertise would be relevant to the functioning 

71 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
of GEAC. Expert members are those who are directors/heads 
of eminent institutions as also others in individual capacity. 
The GEAC is also given the freedom to co-opt other members 
as and when may be required. The constitution of this 
Committee itself ensures that bureaucrats, in stricto senso, do 
not outweigh the presence of experts therein.  
 
27.13. The Petitioner(s) contend that since the experts made part of 
the process, are members of Government bodies, therefore, 
they arguably would be unfit to be appointed. Conversely, it is 
averred by the Union of India that there exists a three-tier 
safety assessment process which involves around 60 experts 
most of whom are external experts from public sector 
institutions and universities. The effect of accepting the 
submission of the Petitioner(s) would mean that a person of 
science, by being a member simpliciter of the Government body, 
would be discounted as an ‘expert’. In other words, the effect 
would be that working for the Government is made equal to a 
curse, for experts who otherwise would have been inducted to 
the GEAC without batting so much as an eyelid. 

72 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
27.14. Additionally, nowhere in the Rules can it be seen that the 
Chairman of the GEAC or any other ‘bureaucratic member’ 
possesses any additional power in the functioning of the body, 
nor has it come on record that without the Chairman or any 
other Government member, the quorum with which a decision 
is to be reached, is incomplete. 
 
27.15. As such, challenge to the 1989 Rules, as a consequence of the 
above discussion fails.  
 
Precautionary Principle  
 
28. I now proceed to examine, the second principle issue, which is as 
to whether in view of the precautionary principle, a complete ban 
on Ht crops is warranted or if not, what are the suitable directions 
that are required to be given by this Court? 
 
TEC 
28.1. Before discussing the precautionary principle, the view of the 
TEC appointed by this Court must be brought on record when 
probing the issue at hand. As discussed above, vide Order 
dated 10.05.2012, this Court appointed a TEC with 6 

73 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
members. The terms of reference (hereinafter referred to as 
‘Tor’) given to the TEC were:  
a. To review and recommend the nature of sequencing 
of risk assessment (environment and health safety) 
studies that need to be done for all GM crops before 
they are released into the environment. [Tor A] 
b. To recommend the sequencing of these tests in order 
to specify the point at which environmental release 
though Open Field Trials can be permitted. [Tor B] 
c. To advise on whether a proper evaluation of the 
genetically engineered crop/plants is scientifically 
tenable in the greenhouse conditions and whether it 
is possible to replicate the conditions for testing under 
different agro ecological regions and seasons in 
greenhouse. [Tor C] 
d. To advise on whether specific conditions imposed by 
the regulatory agencies for Open Field Trials are 
adequate. 
If 
not, 
recommend 
what 
additional 
measures/safeguards 
are 
required 
to 
prevent 
potential risks to the environment. [Tor D] 

74 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
e. Examine the feasibility of prescribing validated 
protocols and active testing for contamination at a 
level that would preclude any escaped material from 
causing an adverse effect on the environment. [Tor E] 
f. To advise on whether institutions/laboratories in 
India have the state-of-art testing facilities and 
professional expertise to conduct various bio safety 
tests and recommend mechanism to strengthen the 
same. If no such institutions are available in India, 
recommend setting up an independent testing 
laboratory/institution. [Tor F] 
 
28.2. The interim report of the TEC was received on 07.10.2012. In 
this interim report the TEC stated: 
i. 
Three major issues were highlighted in the evaluation 
process which require attention:  
a) Apparent lack of qualified full-time personnel in the 
regulatory bodies: The TEC was not convinced that the 
regulatory bodies in their present form are in a position to 
rigorously evaluate all data that comes before them. Further, 

75 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
many of the field trials seem to have been delegated or left to 
the applicant (applying for approval to GEAC) and there is 
very 
limited 
mechanism 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
and 
accountability.   
b) Need for removing conflicts of interest 
c) Increasing inclusiveness of stakeholders with regard to 
decision making on GM products 
ii. All members unanimously felt that the present regulatory 
system and protocol(s) for conducting field trials was 
unsatisfactory and inadequate, requiring major changes, 
restructuring and strengthening. 
iii. Introduction of transgenics in crops for which India is a 
centre of origin or diversity will contaminate the biodiversity 
and it should not be allowed to happen.  
iv. Field Trials should be stopped until the above conditions are 
addressed.  
v. The TEC further recommends a 10 year moratorium on field 
trials of Bt transgenics in all food crops in accordance with 
the precautionary principle.  
 

76 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
28.3. The final report of the TEC was received by this Court 
thereafter, wherein it was stated:  
(i) Bt technology involves engineering plants for insect resistance 
by incorporating the gene for the toxin within the plant’s 
genetic constitution, so that the plant becomes naturally 
resistant to the insect. The benefit of this is a reduced 
requirement for externally applied chemical pesticides, most 
of which are toxic and cause environmental damage.  
(ii) The other major usage of genetically modified crops has been 
for Ht crops, which is herbicide tolerance which makes the 
plant genetically engineered to be resistant to the herbicide. 
The use of Ht technology allows more extensive application of 
the herbicide leading to more complete elimination of weeds 
without killing the crop.  
(iii) GM technology comes with the promise of a number of 
benefits as well as associated risks with regard to health and 
environmental safety.  
(iv) The TEC was informed that it will not be possible to segregate 
genetically modified from non-genetically modified material 

77 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
during collection and storage in India, which would have 
serious implications when it comes to labelling of food.  
(v) Most countries such as China and those in Europe are 
approaching this issue with a fair amount of caution.  
 
Bt Crops 
(vi) The TEC has noted that in several cases that they examined, 
the characterization of the inserted DNA is limited and 
insufficient for comprehensively addressing the issues to 
regulatory approval. Overall the quality of information in 
several of the applications is far below what would be 
expected, and required for rigorous evaluation by a regulatory 
body and is unlikely to meet international regulatory 
guidelines. 
(vii) The TEC examined the approved Bt Cotton and Bt Brinjal 
files relating to toxicity and what emerged from this 
examination is that in several cases, the methodology and 
results are not clearly reported.  
(viii) The TEC considered the process of Environmental Risk 
Assessments (hereinafter “ERA”) in India. It referred to the 

78 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
report of Prof. David Andow on ERA for Bt Brinjal wherein it 
was stated that the GEAC set too narrow a scope for the ERA 
and further, much of the effort towards the ERA was 
misdirected, which did not assess the actual adverse 
environmental consequences in India. The TEC concluded 
that ERAs are inadequately understood and addressed in 
Indian guidelines and regulatory system. The deficiencies are 
likely to be a consequence of the way in which ERA has been 
treated in the guidelines as a set of tests to be carried out 
instead of issues to be investigated and addressed. This kind 
of treatment has resulted in oversimplification, omission, and 
the real purpose of an ERA being missed. 
(ix) The precautionary principle as present in the CPB 
international guidelines would strongly point towards erring 
on the side of caution. The TEC highlighted the critical 
importance of having as complete and comprehensive 
information as possible on the biology of the species when 
considering release of GMOs. It was further pointed out that 
no GMO intended directly as food has been commercially 
introduced into its Centre of Origin, which was happening 

79 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
with the case of Bt Brinjal until ministerial intervention took 
place.  
(x) There are serious deficiencies in reporting of the data in the 
dossiers and more importantly in the way in which these have 
been examined and the conclusions accepted by the 
Regulatory Body. The deficiencies are serious enough that 
several of the dossiers are unlikely to meet international 
guidelines. The regulator (GEAC) has frequently accepted 
conclusions based on incompletely reported data or without 
appropriate statistical analysis.  
(xi)  Some tests need to be carried out for longer duration in order 
to increase the time, of exposure so as to detect possible 
effects with greater confidence. 
 
Ht Crops 
(xii) Information relating to long term chronic toxicity is limited 
for most herbicides. Soybean accounts for the major share of 
Ht crops. 
(xiii) The use of Ht crops would encourage increased use of the 
herbicides with likely negative consequences for biodiversity 

80 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
in agricultural fields and the environment. Experimental 
studies of the possible impact that Ht crops can have on the 
biodiversity and abundance of wildlife have been limited. 
(xiv) Another 
consideration 
in 
the 
Indian 
context 
is 
a 
socioeconomic one wherein a significant part of the 
agricultural workforce is employed for manual labour in the 
fields. Introduction of Ht crops would be likely to reduce 
access to employment for some of the vulnerable sections of 
rural society.  
 
Recommendations 
(xv) It is apparent that there are major gaps in the regulatory 
system. These need to be addressed before issues related to 
tests can be meaningfully considered. 
(xvi) A secretariat comprising dedicated scientists with area 
expertise as well as expertise in biosafety needs to be 
established, 
with 
consultation 
with 
experts 
having 
experience at the international level in biosafety testing 
evaluation of GM safety. 

81 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
(xvii) Conflict of interest in terms of location of the regulatory 
body needs to be addressed.  
(xviii) 
Specific sites for conducting confined field trials need to 
be designated, certified, and sufficient mechanisms put in 
place for monitoring the trials and ensuring restricted 
access, disposal of material, associated testing and other 
facilities. 
 
(xix) Stakeholder participation, socioeconomic considerations, 
societal impact and sustainability should be incorporated at 
an early stage in the risk assessment process. 
 
28.4. After the above observations and discussion, the TEC 
answered the terms of reference in the following manner: 
 
1. Tor A 
The TEC reiterated its recommendation made in the Interim 
Report that there should be a moratorium on field trials for Bt 
in food crops intended for commercialization until there is 
more definitive information as to long term safety of Bt in food 
crops. 

82 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
The TEC stated that it has examined the issues in relation to 
Ht with regard to sustainability and the likely socioeconomic 
impact on major sections of rural society. It reached the 
conclusion that Ht crops would most likely exert a highly 
adverse impact on sustainable agriculture, rural livelihoods 
and environment. The TEC found them completely unsuitable 
in the Indian Context. 
It is pertinent here to notice the corrigendum brought by the 
TEC dated 12.07.2013 wherein the above line was expanded 
and a complete ban on Ht crops in India was recommended by 
the TEC. 
The TEC further recommended that release of genetically 
modified crops for which India is a centre of origin or diversity 
should not be allowed. 
 
2. Tor B 
The sequence of testing should be carried out in order of 
increasing environmental exposure required to perform the 
test. Tests should be done under the minimum conditions of 

83 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
exposure required for the test. The testing therefore proceeds 
in a progressive manner. 
 
3. Tor C 
There is published evidence that the characteristics of a GMO 
can differ significantly depending upon whether it is grown in 
the greenhouse or in the field. It cannot be said that it is 
possible to replicate the conditions for testing under different 
agro-ecological regions and conditions in the greenhouse. 
4. Tor D 
Specific sites for conducting field trials need to be designated, 
certified and sufficient mechanisms put in place for 
monitoring the trials and ensuring restricted access, 
associated testing and other facilities. The trials should not be 
conducted on leased land. 
 
5. Tor E 
There are several ways in which contamination can occur and 
it probably will not be possible to deploy the tests at a level 
that will preclude the possibility of escape.  
 

84 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
6. Tor F 
Based on the review of the dossiers, the professional expertise 
and standards across the institutions appear unsatisfactory. 
The TEC has found in unambiguous terms that at present, the 
regulatory system has major gaps and these will require 
rethinking, investment and relearning to fix. 
 
28.5. As noted above, the TEC consisted of six members, with Dr. 
Rajendra Paroda substituting Prof. VL Chopra on 09.11.2012 
which is post submission of the interim report, the findings 
of which have been noted above. 
 
28.6. Unable to agree with the conclusions of the majority, Dr. 
Paroda submitted his dissent to the final report of the 
majority, alleging various lapses in the decision-making 
process. Those lapses, as pointed out are: 
 
“…. 
 
• To my surprise, the TEC members were not willing 
to take cognizance of any objections/submissions to 
the Interim Report made by different respondents, 
despite clear directive by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. 
As mentioned earlier, a compilation of all objections 
received was shared (Annex-IV) but members seemed 
to have serious reservations to discuss these on the 
plea that there was nothing new, including in fresh 

85 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
submissions by UOI, NAAS, NSAI, Prof. Deepak 
Pental etc. 
 
• On having gone through the minutes of the earlier 
meetings of TEC, prior to my becoming a member 
(Annex-Ill), and the submissions made by various 
respondents, it became apparent that TEC members 
had possibly taken one sided view in their Interim 
Report. 
 
• The TEC members seemed to take an ideological 
stance favouring an anti GM as well as an anti 
transnational approach and possibly believed that 
imposing moratorium on field trials of GM crops was 
the only way to move forward. On the contrary, any 
such move will harm Indian science enormously. 
 
• At the same time, members seemed to have 
proceeded with an assumption that the Indian 
regulatory system was faulty and full of lapses. 
Accordingly, all deliberations of TEC sounded to me 
like a fault finding mission. 
 
• Some members continued relying solely on reports 
of contrarian scientists and propounded their 
views/opinions, while ignoring the fact that such - 
isolated 
research 
claims 
had 
been 
examined 
thoroughly and rejected by a wide section of scientific 
community as well as by the regulatory authorities of 
their respective countries as well as other well 
reputed regulatory bodies. 
 
• As mentioned earlier, no other member provided any 
input on the TOR nor did they respond to any of the 
write-ups provided by me. As a result, no substantive 
evidence-based discussion could take place during 
the 
meetings 
in 
order 
to 
arrive 
at 
general 
consensus/understanding. 
 
• The only shared document was the part draft report 
(26 pages), which did not reflect general deliberations 
held nor did it follow the agreed format. I did convey 
my concern over adopting this entirely different 
approach with utter disregard to decisions taken in 
earlier meetings, but with no positive output. 

86 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
 
• In a scenario like this, reflecting considerable lack 
of transparency, I am left with no other alternative but 
to submit this report separately - the last thing I 
would have wished otherwise.” 
 
28.7. While these lapses pointed out by Dr. Paroda pertained to 
procedural aspects of the TEC however among other minor 
differences, twin substantial differences in respect of a) 
conducting field trials which the former recommends 
continuation in the interest of scientific development and the 
latter recommends against given numerous regulatory 
lacunae; and b) the former does not oppose the development 
of HT crops while the latter, once again in view of the lacunae, 
bats for a wholesale ban.   
 
28.8. Dr. Paroda recommended that there should be development 
of 
comprehensive 
guidelines 
for 
Environmental 
Risk 
Assessment (ERA) with consultation with all stakeholders and 
the general public. A full time Risk Assessment Unit with 
permanent staff consisting of a multidisciplinary team of 
scientists should be established. National Agriculture 
Research System (NARS) should lead agronomic performance 

87 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
testing and release of GM varieties/hybrids in line with the 
National Seed Policy while making use of already existing 
procedures under AICRP. 
28.9. He was further of the view that the proper evaluation of a 
Genetically Engineered plant is scientifically not tenable in a 
contained greenhouse and confined field testing is the right 
option for a realistic evaluation of any GE plant. Each 
confined field trial must be monitored by a ‘site specific 
monitoring committee’. A well-designed case-to-case post-
release monitoring system must be put in place to address 
specific post-release issues identified during the event 
approval by GEAC. RCGM and GEAC should review isolation 
distances for confined field trials and suitability of additional 
measures. Research projects must be funded by DBT, ICAR 
and relevant arm of the Government. Accredited laboratories 
must be notified for detection of GM crops. The regulatory 
authorities should develop a system of examining papers or 
reports about the adverse effects of GM crops and 
communicate the same to public. Special fund allocation is 
desirable for the purpose of creating public awareness. 

88 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
 
28.10. I am not inclined to accept the objections raised by the 
Petitioners, for consideration of the report of Dr. Paroda. 
Given that the substance in issue is scientific in nature, the 
minority report cannot be ignored entirely. After perusing 
both the reports, while there are certain differences, one also 
finds substantial similarities. They may be noted: 
 
 
TEC 
(5 Members) 
Dr. Paroda 
 
The 
overall 
process 
of 
risk 
assessment should follow the 
flowchart for the Risk Assessment 
process in the Guidance on Risk 
assessment of Living Modified 
Organisms 
of 
the 
Cartagena 
Protocol on Biosafety. 
For environmental risk assessment 
there 
is 
an 
urgent 
need 
for 
developing 
comprehensive 
guidelines in consultation with all 
stakeholders and general public. 
There should be establishment of 
risk assessment unit which should 
be permanently staffed by    a multi-
disciplinary team. 
It is generally not possible to 
replicate the conditions for testing 
under 
different 
agro-ecological 
regions and conditions in the 
greenhouse. 
Proper evaluation of GE plants is 
not 
scientifically 
tenable 
in 
contained greenhouses as natural, 
varying 
conditions 
representing 
different 
agro-ecological 
regions 
and growing seasons cannot be 
feasibly replicated.  
Specific sites for conducting field 
trials need to be designated, 
certified 
and 
sufficient 
mechanism put in place for 
monitoring the trials and ensuring 
restricted 
access, 
disposal 
of 
material, associated testing and 
other facilities. These sites should 
be used only for field trials of GM 
crops. 
Trials 
should 
not 
be 
conducted on leased land. 
No trials should be allowed in non-
notified fields, leased or otherwise. 
A system should be evolved for 
notification of confined field trial 
sites which should include both 
public 
and 
private 
sector 
institutions 
subject 
to 
certain 
conditions. 

89 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
 
 
28.11. With respect to the objections raised by the Union of India, 
to the TEC report, that the TEC went beyond its scope, a 
perusal of the recommendations made, juxtaposed with the 
Tor, one finds that the latter are largely within the scope of 
the question that had been put to them. The TEC has confined 
itself only to issues relevant to answering Tors. 
 
28.12. As discussed earlier, in Kantha Vibhag (supra), this Court 
observed that: 
 
“15. It is first important to differentiate expert 
committees which are set by the courts/tribunals 
from those set up by the Government in exercise of 
executive powers or under a particular statute. The 
latter are set up due to their technical expertise in a 
given area, and their reports are, subject to judicially 
observed restraints, open to judicial review before 
courts when decisions are taken solely based upon 
A requisite understanding of the 
process of Risk assessment be 
developed through consultation, 
collaboration 
and 
capacity 
building as the regulatory system 
has gaps and require rethinking, 
investment and relearning. 
There is a need to strengthen the 
public sector laboratories through 
funding in order to have required 
infrastructure and human resource 
development. There should be a 
major 
human 
resource 
development initiative for training 
in 
national 
and 
international 
institutions. 
Government 
may 
establish 
inter-ministerial 
coordination 
and 
monitoring 
mechanism to create/strengthen 
public research institutions for 
regulatory process. 

90 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
them. The precedents of this court unanimously note 
that courts should be circumspect in rejecting the 
opinion of these committees, unless they find their 
decision to be manifestly arbitrary or mala fide. On 
the other hand, courts/tribunals themselves set up 
expert committees on occasion. These committees are 
set up because the fact-finding exercise in many 
matters can be complex, technical and time-
consuming, and may often require the committees to 
conduct field visits. These committees are set up with 
specific terms of reference outlining their mandate, 
and their reports have to conform to the mandate. 
Once these committees submit their final reports to 
the court/tribunal, it is open to the parties to object 
to them, which is then adjudicated upon. The role of 
these expert committees does not substitute the 
adjudicatory role of the court or tribunal. The role of 
an expert committee appointed by an adjudicatory 
forum is only to assist it in the exercise of 
adjudicatory functions by providing them better data 
and factual clarity, which is also open to challenge by 
all concerned parties. Allowing for objections to be 
raised and considered makes the process fair and 
participatory for all stakeholders.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
28.13. The above observations make it abundantly clear that this 
Court is not bound by the conclusions reached by its own 
expert committee. The report of the expert committee is 
important for the court to be apprised of the technical aspects 
of a particular dispute by independent experts. For a court or 
tribunal to rely entirely on the report of an expert committee 
would be improper as this would amount to the court 

91 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
abdicating its own adjudicatory function and replacing its 
wisdom with that of the expert committee.  
 
 
 
Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports 
 
29. There are two reports of Parliamentary Standing Committees on 
this issue. The first one being, the 37th Report of the Committee 
on Agriculture (2011-2012) titled ‘Cultivation of Genetically 
Modified Food Crops - Prospects and Effects’ dated 09.08.2012. 
The Committee considered oral and documentary evidence, 
thereafter made the following observations: 
i. 
Bio-technology offers many advantages over traditional 
techniques of plant breeding in major food crops such as 
low production cost, conservation of bio-diversity and 
economic-social benefits including poverty alleviation. This 
technology 
(transgenics/genetic 
engineering) 
is 
environmentally friendly, sustainable and affordable. 
ii. In respect of field trials which is a highly contested issue 
before us it is observed that they serve a multiplicity of 
purposes: 
 

92 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
“(i) For the plant breeder, they provide the first 
opportunity to evaluate the agronomic potential of 
novel-plant trait combinations in open environment 
which is not possible in contained conditions of 
greenhouse. 
 
(ii) It is necessary to measure the level of protein 
expression from any newly introduced genes in the 
plant tissues to assess its efficacy in the open 
environment and impact on the target and non target 
organisms consuming the genetically modified plant. 
 
(iii) It allows the production of sufficient quantities of 
plant 
material 
for 
use 
in 
livestock 
feeding 
studies/trials and to conduct compositional analyses, 
which 
are 
necessary 
for 
human 
food 
safety 
assessment. 
 
(iv) Such trials are also necessary to collect the 
agronomic and ecological data required to complete 
the environment safety assessment of genetically 
modified plant.” 
 
 
iii. The views of Dr. P.M. Bhargava were taken by the 
Committee and his stand was not a permanent ban on 
release of GMOs but ensuring that they are adequately 
tested before any such release take place. At the same time 
he stated that the refusal to do chronic toxicity studies was 
against the interest of the nation and that despite the 
technological advancements, there is not an Indian lab in 
which testing can be done.  

93 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
iv. It was noted that the GEAC does not directly perform 
studies of safety assessment and it is the applicant who is 
to submit data of its studies to the RCGM and GEAC, and 
after comments thereon final decision is taken. 
v. In conclusion, with respect to the regulatory mechanism, it 
was observed: 
 
“2.92 … The Committee can safely conclude that all is 
not well with the regulatory mechanism put in place 
by the Government for oversight of cutting edge 
technology as sensitive as GMOs and products 
thereof. Firstly, GEAC being an entity created under 
rules rather than an Act of Parliament deprives it of 
the status, powers and more importantly autonomy 
and independence that a statutory regulator ought to 
have. The enforceability of Rules, albeit made under 
some Act only, does not have as much definitiveness 
and clarity as under an Act. Furthermore, unlike an 
Act, there is a lot of scope for varied interpretation of 
Rules as also flexibility to implement them. The 
confusion 
about 
the 
recommendatory/approving 
authority of GEAC whether due to genuine confusion 
or deliberate; the confession of the Co-Chairman of 
GEAC, the only technocrat in the top three positions 
of GEAC, about minister/GEAC/industry pressuring 
him to favour a bad technology; the various acts of 
omission and commission of GEAC that have been 
documented in various chapters of this Report, all go 
on to cement the view of the Committee that the 
regulatory 
mechanism 
definitely 
requires 
the 
protection and support of an Act of the Parliament 
which leaves no scope for ambiguity or complacency.” 
 
 
vi. The Committee lamented that even after the Cartagena 
Protocol on Biosafety was adopted on 17.01.2003, many 

94 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
key issues such as risk assessment, liability and redress, 
identification of living modified organisms etc. are still in 
the discussion stage.  
vii. Having taken note of the various shortcomings and gaps in 
the regulatory mechanism, the Committee expressed a 
desire that all research and development be done in 
containment and field trial be discontinued forthwith. 
viii. Labelling of GM and non-GM products was also an issue 
considered by the Committee and it was recommended that 
such labelling be made mandatory so that a consumer can 
make an informed choice. 
ix. Referring to the Dr. M.S. Swaminathan Report, the 
Department of Agriculture stated that:  
 
“biotechnology provides an opportunity to convert bio 
resources into economic wealth. This has to be done 
in a manner that there is no adverse impact either on 
the environment or on human or animal health. The 
guiding 
principle 
for 
following 
the 
National 
agricultural biotechnology policy should be the 
economic well-being of farm families, food security of 
the nation, health security of the consumer, 
protection of the environment and security of our 
national 
and 
international 
trade 
in 
farm 
commodities”. 
 
 

95 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
x. The Committee recorded the admission of the concerned 
official of the Department of the Agriculture that if the 
dependence on Bt crops goes beyond a point, it would “be 
a gigantic task to revive the traditional cotton varieties from 
the gene bank and may take years together” at the same 
time it was recorded that, efforts and the direction were 
proceeding and it was not that the ship had sailed. 
xi. Certain other observations recorded by the Committee are 
essential: 
 
“8.97 India also entered the scene in developing and 
deploying transgenic crops (genetically modified 
crops) since early 1990s, with very good intentions 
and preparations to deal with ensuring the safety of 
such technology so that it does not harm the 
environment and human health. The policy and 
regulatory frameworks suggested, developed and 
implemented had all the good provisions to ensure 
public safety and ensure food sovereignty of the 
country. The policy and regulatory frameworks were 
put in place using well thought-out plans. However, 
the developments in technology and deployment over-
took the speed of policy implementation which caused 
apprehensions in the minds of general public about 
the technology and the over-sight for its deployment.” 
 
 
29.1. At this stage, the Petitioners have placed reliance on the 301st  
Report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science 
and Technology, Environment and Forest titled “Genetically 

96 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
Modified Crops and its Impact on Environment” dated 
25.08.2017. 
i. 
The Committee after taking an overview of the regulatory 
mechanism as also taking note of the official and non-
official witnesses recorded as under: 
 
“The Committee takes note of the divergent views on 
the efficacy of existing regulatory mechanism. On the 
one hand, the Government claims that are very 
stringent regulatory mechanism has been put in place 
leaving no scope for any non-whatsoever by the 
technology developer whereas on the contrary, the 
Committee has been given to understand by some 
representatives of the civil society that the existing 
regulatory mechanism is stringent on paper only and 
the whole process of regulation depends upon the 
data made available to the regulators by the 
technology developers. The Committee is surprised to 
know that none of the Committees referred to in the 
preceding paragraphs conduct the closed field trials 
on their own but are solely dependent on the data 
provided to them by the technology developer. The 
Committee feels that this leaves the scope for the 
technology developers to fudge the data to suit their 
own 
requirements. 
The 
existing 
regulatory 
mechanism 
is, 
therefore, 
susceptible 
to 
manipulations. 
The 
Committee, 
therefore, 
recommends that the Central Government should, in 
consultation with the State Governments and 
Administrations of the Union Territories ensure that 
the whole process of field trials should be done in 
close environment keeping biosafety and health safety 
in mind and in collaboration with agricultural 
universities so as to minimise the scope of fudging the 
primary data.” 
 
 

97 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
ii. 
The Committee noticed that the production of GM crops 
was concentrated only in a select few countries, India 
being one of them but also noted the general hesitation 
of developed economies to use this technology at a wide 
scale. The observation in this regard is as extracted 
hereunder: 
 
“The Committee notes that currently, twenty years 
after their introduction in 1996, only 6 countries 
continue to account for over 90% of all GM crop area 
globally (USA 40%, Brazil 23%, Argentina 14%, India 
6%, Canada 6%, China 2%). The Committee was 
informed by the members of civil society during the 
deliberation on the subject that there was a decline in 
GM crop area in 2015. The Committee notes with 
surprise that inspite of the fact that GM technology is 
being propagated as the most advanced agricultural 
technology, 17 of the 20 most developed countries 
(HDI) do not grow it which includes most of Europe, 
Japan, Russia, Israel etc. The Committee opines that 
there is increasing evidence about the lack of safety 
of GM crops and little or no benefits to justify the 
risks, most countries in the world do not grow GM 
crops. The Committee also feels that the policy 
makers of these countries, as custodians for both 
present and future generations, have seen that GM 
organisms spread rapidly, that the impacts have been 
unpredictable, potentially hazardous, uncontrollable 
and irreversible, assessed the benefits and risks, 
taken note of emerging evidence of harm, and 
therefore do not permit GM crops. The non 
acceptance of the most advanced agricultural 
technology, GM technology, by the most developed 
countries raises doubts about the efficacy of the 
technology. The Committee, therefore, feels that the 
Government of India should conduct a comparative 
study to examine the reasons for not accepting this 

98 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
technology by these developed countries viz-a-viz the 
reasons led to its acceptance.” 
 
iii. 
The Committee has noted that despite the tiered 
regulatory system in place, there is no scrutiny of the 
process of Environmental Impact Assessment and 
reliance is predominantly on the data supplied by the 
Applicant. It was recommended that an independent 
agency 
consisting 
of 
persons 
with 
impeccable 
credentials should carry out the process of evaluation to 
ensure that there is no violation of the existing 
regulations. 
iv. 
The Committee has come out in support of placing every 
piece of information, in public scrutiny.  It is wise to 
ensure that the entire process reflects the values of 
participation and transparency with the overall goal 
being to clear out the doubts in the mind of the public. 
v. 
In respect of cross-contamination of GM and non-GM 
crops the acceptance of the Department of Agricultural 
Research and Education was noted, that a herbicide 
tolerant gene may escape by way of pollination to 

99 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
another farm that is to another GM or non-GM crop and, 
therefore, the committee was of the view that if 
cultivation, 
side-by-side 
or 
in 
other 
words 
simultaneously, was allowed there would be no way to 
stop contamination. It therefore recommended that the 
MoEFCC undertake a study in that regard and take 
“desired measures”. 
vi. 
The Committee underscored the need for India based 
studies to be undertaken to examine the effect of GM 
crops on “our environment on account of GM crops” 
keeping in view the “topography of our country and its 
diversity”. It was also noted that the impact of these 
crops on human as well as animal health has not been 
adequately studied. 
 
29.2. In response to the above reports, the Union of India has 
submitted a compliance chart, stating that most of the lacunae 
that has been pointed out by the Committees, has been 
complied with and that the present regulatory system is in 
consonance with international standards and safeguards, to 

100 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
ensure that the precautionary approach is complied with.  
Another argument that has been put forth on behalf of the 
Union of India is that these reports are from the year 2012 and 
2017, respectively and thereafter, in the past 7 years, the 
scientific research has come a long way.  
 
29.3. The evidentiary value of such reports is no longer res integra 
and was clarified by a Constitution Bench of this Court in 
Kalpana Mehta v. Union of India (5-Judge Bench)34.  Dipak 
Misra, CJI (as he then was), observed:  
 
“159.1. Parliamentary Standing Committee report 
can be taken aid of for the purpose of interpretation 
of a statutory provision wherever it is so necessary 
and also it can be taken note of as existence of a 
historical fact.  
 
159.2. Judicial 
notice 
can 
be 
taken 
of 
the 
Parliamentary Standing Committee report under 
Section 57(4) of the Evidence Act and it is admissible 
under Section 74 of the said Act. 
 
159.3. In a litigation filed either under Article 32 or 
Article 136 of the Constitution of India, this Court can 
take on record the report of the Parliamentary 
Standing Committee. However, the report cannot be 
impinged or challenged in a court of law. 
 
159.4. Where the fact is contentious, the petitioner 
can always collect the facts from many a source and 
produce such facts by way of affidavits, and the court 
 
34 (2018) 7 SCC 1 

101 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
can render its verdict by way of independent 
adjudication 
 
159.5. The Parliamentary Standing Committee report 
being in the public domain can invite fair comments 
and criticism from the citizens as in such a situation, 
the citizens do not really comment upon any Member 
of Parliament to invite the hazard of violation of 
parliamentary privilege.” 
 
 
Dr D.Y. Chandrachud, J. (as he then was) in his detailed 
consideration of the issue at hand, observed: 
 
“275. Parliamentary Committees are an intrinsic part 
of the process by which the elected legislature in a 
democracy exacts accountability on the part of the 
Government. 
Department 
related 
Parliamentary 
Standing Committees undertake the meticulous 
exercise of scrutinising the implementation of law, 
including welfare legislation and the performance of 
the departments of the State. The purpose of law is to 
promote order for the benefit of the citizen and to 
protect rights and entitlements guaranteed by the 
Constitution and by statute. Access to justice as a 
means of securing fundamental freedoms and 
realising 
socio-economic 
entitlements 
is 
complementary to the work of other organs of the 
State. The modern doctrine of separation of powers 
has moved away from a “one organ - one function” 
approach, to a more realistic perspective which 
recognises the complementarity in the work which is 
performed by institutions of governance. Judicial 
review is founded on the need to ensure accountable 
governance in the administration of law as an 
instrument of realising the rights guaranteed by the 
Constitution. If the function of judicial review in 
facilitating the realisation of socio-economic rights is 
construed in the context of the modern notion of 
separation of powers, there is no real conflict between 
the independence of the judicial process and its 
reliance on published reports of Parliamentary 

102 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
Committees. Ultimately it is for the court in each case 
to determine the relevance of a report to the case at 
hand and the extent to which reliance can be placed 
upon it to facilitate access to justice. Reports of 
Parliamentary Committees become part of the 
published record of the State. As a matter of principle, 
there is no reason or justification to exclude them 
from the purview of the judicial process, for purposes 
such as understanding the historical background of 
a law, the nature of the problem, the causes of a social 
evil and the remedies which may provide answers to 
intractable problems of governance. The court will in 
the facts of a case determine when a matter which is 
contentious between the parties would have to be 
adjudicated upon independently on the basis of the 
evidence adduced in accordance with law. 
 
276. In the circumstances, the reference is answered 
by holding that: 
276.1. As a matter of principle, there is no reason 
why reliance upon the report of a Parliamentary 
Standing Committee cannot be placed in proceedings 
under Article 32 or Article 136 of the Constitution;  
276.2. Once the report of a Parliamentary Committee 
has been published, reference to it in the course of 
judicial proceedings will not constitute a breach of 
parliamentary privilege; 
276.3. The validity of the report of a Parliamentary 
Committee cannot be called into question in the 
court. No Member of Parliament or person can be 
made liable for what is stated in the course of the 
proceedings before a Parliamentary Committee or for 
a vote tendered or given; and 
276.4. When a matter before the court assumes a 
contentious character, a finding of fact by the court 
must be premised on the evidence adduced in the 
judicial proceeding as explained in paras 265 and 
274.” 
 
The final conclusions of the Bench were as follows: 
 
“449.1. According to clause (2) of Article 105 of 
Constitution of India no Member of Parliament can be 

103 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
held liable for anything said by him in Parliament or 
in any committee. The reports submitted by Members 
of Parliament are also fully covered by protection 
extended under clause (2) of Article 105 of the 
Constitution of India. 
449.2. The publication of the reports not being only 
permitted, but also are being encouraged by 
Parliament. The general public is keenly interested in 
knowing 
about 
the 
parliamentary 
proceedings 
including parliamentary reports which are steps 
towards the governance of the country. The right to 
know about the reports only arises when they have 
been published for use of the public in general. 
449.3. Section 57(4) of the Evidence Act, 1872 makes 
it clear that the course of proceedings of Parliament 
and the Legislature, established under any law are 
facts of which judicial notice shall be taken by the 
Court. 
449.4. Parliament has already adopted a report of 
“privilege committee”, that for those documents which 
are public documents within the meaning of the 
Evidence Act, there is no requirement of any 
permission of the Speaker of Lok Sabha for producing 
such documents as evidence in court. 
449.5. That mere fact that document is admissible in 
evidence whether a public or private document does 
not lead to draw any presumption that the contents 
of the documents are also true and correct. 
449.6. When a party relies on any fact stated in the 
Parliamentary Committee report as the matter of 
noticing an event or history no exception can be taken 
on such reliance of the report. However, no party can 
be allowed to “question” or “impeach” report of 
Parliamentary 
Committee. 
The 
parliamentary 
privilege, that it shall not be impeached or questioned 
outside Parliament shall equally apply both to a party 
who files claim in the court and other who objects to 
it. Any observation in the report or inference of the 
Committee cannot be held to be binding between the 
parties. The parties are at liberty to lead evidence 
independently to prove their stand in a court of law. 
449.7. Both the parties have not disputed that 
parliamentary reports can be used for the purposes of 
legislative history of a statute as well as for 
considering the statement made by a minister. When 

104 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
there is no breach of privilege in considering the 
parliamentary materials and reports of the Committee 
by the Court for the above two purposes, we fail to see 
any valid reason for not accepting the submission of 
the petitioner that courts are not debarred from 
accepting the parliamentary materials and reports, on 
record, before it, provided the court does not proceed 
to permit the parties to question and impeach the 
reports. 
449.8. The 
Constitution 
does 
not 
envisage 
supremacy of any of the three organs of the State. 
But, functioning of all the three organs is controlled 
by the Constitution. Wherever, interaction and 
deliberations among the three organs have been 
envisaged, a delicate balance and mutual respect are 
contemplated. All the three organs have to strive to 
achieve the constitutional goal set out for “We the 
People”. Mutual harmony and respect have to be 
maintained by all the three organs to serve the 
Constitution under which we all live. 
449.9. We are of the view that fair comments on 
report of the Parliamentary Committee are fully 
protected under the rights guaranteed under Article 
19(1)(a). However, the comments when turn into 
personal attack on the individual Member of 
Parliament or the House or made in vulgar or abusive 
language tarnishing the image of the Member or the 
House, the said comments amount to contempt of the 
House and breach of privilege. 
449.10. The function of adjudicating rights of the 
parties has been entrusted to the constituted courts 
as per constitutional scheme, which adjudication has 
to be made after observing the procedural safeguards 
which include the right to be heard and the right to 
produce evidence. Parliament, however, is not vested 
with any adjudicatory jurisdiction which belongs to 
judicature under the constitutional scheme. 
449.11. Admissibility of a Parliamentary Committee 
report in evidence does not mean that facts stated in 
the Report stand proved. When issues of facts come 
before a court of law for adjudication, the court is to 
decide the issues on the basis of evidence and 
materials brought before it.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 

105 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
29.4. The detailed discussion on the value of Parliamentary 
Committee reports as undertaken by the Constitution Bench 
sheds light by holding that there is no bar in taking into 
consideration such reports under Article 32 or Article 136 of 
the Constitution of India. At the same time, it has been 
observed that they are not to be taken as conclusive proof of 
fact and the Court in performing its adjudicatory functions has 
to decide on the basis of materials before it, however the latter 
should not be taken to mean that credit of such report is 
impeached.  
29.5. The question at hand is the adequacy of the assessment and 
approval procedures for GM Crops. The task of this Court, is 
therefore to examine whether the impugned procedures rise to 
the level of a violation of fundamental rights. This is a legal 
determination to be made by this Court, based on all materials 
placed before it and a wholistic view of the matter. Even if the 
TEC and parliamentary standing committees have found 
certain issues with the procedures governing GM crops, that 
cannot automatically lead to the conclusion that gaps in the 
impugned procedures result in a violation of Part III of the 

106 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
Constitution of India and must be invalidated or that the 
impugned action be stalled. Therefore, I now proceed to 
examine, whether the gaps pointed out in the abovementioned 
reports, 
would 
reach 
the 
threshold 
of 
violating 
the 
precautionary principle and in that view of the matter, what 
directions must be given.  
Scope of Precautionary Principle 
 
30. The genesis of the precautionary principle in India can be traced 
back to the decision of this Court in Vellore Citizens Welfare 
Forum v. Union of India (3-Judge Bench)35, wherein it was held 
that the precautionary principle is an essential feature of the 
principle of sustainable development. It went on to explain the 
precautionary principle in the following terms: 
 
“i. 
Environmental 
measures 
- 
by 
the 
State 
Government and the statutory authorities - must 
anticipate, prevent, and attack the causes of 
environmental degradation. 
 
ii. Where there are threats of serious and irreversible 
damage, lack of scientific certainty should not be 
used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent 
environmental degradation. 
 
 
35 (1996) 5 SCC 647 

107 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
iii. The "onus of proof" is on the actor or the 
developer/industrialist to show that his action is 
environmentally benign." 
 
 
30.1. This principle over the years, has been developed further and 
recognised as an integral part of the Indian Constitution. 
Recently, in Hospitality Association of Mudumalai v. In 
Defence of Environment & Animals (3-Judge Bench)36, this 
Court reiterated that the precautionary principle forms part 
of the Constitution of India under Articles 21, 47, 48 and 51-
A(g). The requirement placed on the Government under the 
precautionary principle to “anticipate, prevent and attack the 
causes of environmental degradation” was emphatically 
reiterated. 
 
30.2. This Court has clarified that a precautionary approach, is not 
one which is opposed to development.  In N.D. Jayal (Supra) 
while relying on Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum (Supra) 
and M.C. Mehta v. Union of India (3-Judge Bench)37, 
emphasis was laid on sustainable development. This Court 
 
36 (2020) 10 SCC 589 
37 (2002) 4 SCC 356 

108 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
observed that the balance between environmental protection 
and developmental activities could only be maintained by 
strictly following the principle of “sustainable development”. 
This is a development strategy that caters to the needs of the 
present without negotiating the ability of upcoming 
generations to satisfy their needs. The strict observance of 
sustainable development will put us on a path that ensures 
development while protecting the environment, a path that 
works for all people and for all generations. It is a guarantee 
to the present and a bequeath to the future. All environment-
related developmental activities should benefit more people 
while maintaining the environmental balance. This could be 
ensured only by strict adherence to sustainable development 
without which the life of the coming generations will be in 
jeopardy. 
Further it was opined that:  
 
 “24. The right to development cannot be treated as a 
mere right to economic betterment or cannot be 
limited as a misnomer to simple construction 
activities. The right to development encompasses 
much more than economic well-being, and includes 
within its definition the guarantee of fundamental 
human rights. The “development” is not related only 
to the growth of GNP. In the classic work, 

109 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
Development As Freedom, the Nobel prize winner 
Amartya Sen pointed out that “the issue of 
development 
cannot 
be 
separated 
from 
the 
conceptual framework of human right”. This idea is 
also part of the UN Declaration on the Right to 
Development. The right to development includes the 
whole spectrum of civil, cultural, economic, political 
and social process, for the improvement of peoples' 
well-being and realization of their full potential. It is 
an integral part of human rights. Of course, 
construction of a dam or a mega project is definitely 
an attempt to achieve the goal of wholesome 
development. Such works could very well be treated 
as integral component for development.” 
 
 
30.3. The necessity to strike a balance between development and 
ecology was reiterated by this Court in Karnataka Industrial 
Areas Development Board v. C. Kenchappa (2-Judge 
Bench)38 wherein it was observed:  
 
“61. The priority of developing nations is urgent 
industrialisation and development. We have reached 
at a point where it is necessary to strike a golden 
balance between development and ecology. 
 
62. The development should be such as it can be 
sustained by ecology. All this has given rise to the 
concept of sustainable development. 
 
    
x 
 
x 
 
x 
 
x 
 
67. 
A 
nation's 
progress 
largely 
depends 
on 
development, therefore, the development cannot be 
stopped, but we need to control it rationally. No 
Government 
can 
cope 
with 
the 
problem 
of 
environmental 
repair 
by 
itself 
alone; 
people's 
voluntary 
participation 
in 
environmental 
management is a must for sustainable development. 
 
38 (2006) 6 SCC 371 

110 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
There is a need to create environmental awareness 
which may be propagated through formal and 
informal education. We must scientifically assess the 
ecological impact of various developmental schemes. 
To meet the challenge of current environmental 
issues, the entire globe should be considered the 
proper arena for environmental adjustment. Unity of 
mankind is not just a dream of the enlightenment but 
a biophysical fact.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
30.4. In Electrosteel Steels Limited v. Union of India and Ors. 
(2-Judge 
Bench)39 
while 
dealing 
with 
ex-post 
facto 
environmental clearances, this Court observed that the Court 
cannot be oblivious to the economy or others dependent on a 
project, if the project in question complies with environmental 
considerations.  
  
30.5. Recently, in NHAI v. Pandarinathan Govindarajulu (3-Judge 
Bench)40, it was observed: 
 
“18. While economic development should not be 
allowed at the cost of ecology or by causing 
widespread environmental destruction, the necessity 
to preserve ecology and environment should not 
hamper economic and other development. Both 
development and environment must go hand in hand. 
In other words, there should not be development at 
the cost of environment and vice versa, but there 
should be development while taking due care and 
 
39 (2023) 6 SCC 615 
40 (2021) 6 SCC 693 

111 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
ensuring the protection of environment [Indian 
Council For Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India, 
(1996) 5 SCC 281]. The traditional concept that 
development and ecology are opposed to each other is 
no longer acceptable [Vellore Citizens' Welfare 
Forum v. Union of India, (1996) 5 SCC 647].” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
30.6. A similar approach was taken in Rajeev Suri v. DDA (3-Judge 
Bench)41 wherein judicial review of the Central Vista Project 
was sought. The majority, in this case, observed:  
 
“519. Indubitably, environment and development are 
not sworn enemies of each other. It would be an 
anomalous approach to consider environment as a 
hurdle in development and vice versa. The entities 
like EAC and NGT are created to strike a just balance 
between two competing interests and a time-tested 
principle of striking this balance is timely invocation 
of mitigating environmental measures amidst a 
development activity. True that mere application of 
certain mitigating measures may not alleviate 
environmental concerns in all matters and in some 
circumstances, 
the 
project 
is 
simply 
incomprehensible with the environment. But as long 
as a legitimate development activity can be carried on 
in harmony with the idea of environmental protection 
and preservation including sustainable development, 
the Courts as well as expert bodies should make their 
best endeavour to ensure that harmony is upheld and 
hurdles are minimised by resorting to active 
mitigating measures. 
 
520… The primary requirement underlying this 
principle is to ensure that every development work 
is sustainable; and this requirement of sustainability 
demands that the first attempt of every agency 
enforcing environmental rule of law in the country 
 
41 (2022) 11 SCC 1 

112 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
ought to be to alleviate environmental concerns by 
proper mitigating measures. The future generations 
have an equal stake in the environment and 
development. They are as much entitled to a 
developed society as they are to an environmentally 
secure society. 
 
  
 
x 
 
x 
 
x 
 
524. The precautionary principle duly mandates that 
all agencies of the State, including Courts, must make 
their best endeavour to ensure that precaution is 
instilled in the process of development. The very 
requirement of prior EC is born out of this need for 
precaution. It is a manifestation of the precautionary 
principle in India and if development work is carried 
out in furtherance of prior EC and such EC is not 
vitiated by illegality, it would be a case of proper 
adherence with the precautionary principle. 
 
525. In matters of balancing between competing 
environmental and development concerns, the Court 
has to be project-specific. In environmental matters, 
even one fact here or there may have the effect of 
attributing a totally distinct character to the project 
and accordingly, the scope of judicial review may 
vary.  
 
  
 
x 
 
x 
 
x 
 
528. They must always look for a careful balance 
when two equally relevant interests compete with 
each other. The task may not be easy, but is the only 
reasonable recourse. For the proper application of 
these principles, the first and foremost thing to be 
kept in mind is the nature of the project. In the 
present case, the subject project is an independent 
building and construction project wherein one-time 
construction activity is to be carried out. It is not a 
perpetual or continuous activity like a running 
industry. It is absolutely incomprehensible to accept 
that a project of this nature would be unsustainable 
with the needs and aspirations of future generations. 
Furthermore, the increase in footprint is not shown to 
be substantial and the inclusion of new Members of 
Parliament after the delimitation exercise is anyway 

113 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
going to lead to an inevitable increase in footprint 
(floating though) that cannot be countenanced as a 
concern here.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
30.7. In M K Ranjitsinh & Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. (3-
Judge Bench)42, the need for adopting a nuanced approach, 
balancing two environmental goals, i.e., fighting the climatic 
crisis as also protection of wildlife ecology was underscored in 
following words:  
 
“53… Unlike the conventional notion of sustainable 
development, which often pits economic growth 
against environmental conservation, the dilemma 
here 
involves 
a 
nuanced 
interplay 
between 
safeguarding biodiversity and mitigating the impact of 
climate change. It is not a binary choice between 
conservation and development but rather a dynamic 
interplay between protecting a critically endangered 
species and addressing the pressing global challenge 
of climate change.” 
 
 
Additional Guidelines 
 
31. We must also, at this point, make references to the guidelines that 
have been brought by the Union of India, to supplement the 
existing framework:  
 
42 2024 SCC Online SC 570 

114 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
i. Guidelines 
for 
Environmental 
Risk 
Assessment 
of 
Genetically Engineered Plants, 2016 and Environmental 
Risk Assessment of Genetically Engineered Plants- A 
Guide for Stakeholders, 2016 - The objective of these 
Guidelines is to ensure safe development and use of plant 
resulting from modern biotechnology after assessment of any 
potential negative impacts through a comprehensive, 
transparent and science based framework of identification of 
harms using a conventional case to case approach. These 
guidelines profess to provide a practical elaboration of the risk 
assessment framework included in the Indian regulation and 
in Annex III of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety as also the 
Working 
Committee 
on 
Harmonisation 
of 
Regulatory 
Oversight in Biotechnology of the Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD).  
 
They provide a detailed roadmap for Environmental Risk 
Assessment right from the approach to be adopted to problem 
formulation (development of risk hypothesis), to detailed 
instructions on data quality to informational requirement and 

115 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
description of the non-transgenic parental plants/donor 
organisms, characterization of genetic modification to 
cultivation practices to potential adverse non-target effects of 
GMOs on biodiversity to post release environmental 
monitoring. 
 
ii. Risk Analysis Framework 2016 - These guidelines provide 
the risk analysis method for the environmental release of GE 
plants and divides them into different stages which can be 
shown through a following chart:  
 
 
Decision
Risk
Communication
Application for 
Environmental Release 
of GE plant
Risk Context
Risk 
Assessment
Risk Management
Stakeholders

116 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
(a) Risk Context being the preparatory stage defines the scope 
and boundaries, sets the criteria against which risk will be 
evaluated and describes the structures and process for the 
analysis. Decisions on application for the environmental 
release of a GE plant require case-by-case assessment and 
details of the GE plant and the proposed activities, 
including any proposed controls, limits or containment 
measures, form the specific risk context.  
(b) This 
framework 
includes 
Risk 
Assessment, 
Risk 
Management and Risk Communication. Risk Assessment 
and Risk Management form an essential part of decision 
making in respect to the applications for environmental 
release of GE plants. 
(c) The chapter on Risk Assessment provides comprehensive 
methodology to identify and characterize risks to the health 
and safety of people or to the environment from the release 
of GE plants. It includes risk identification (postulating risk 
scenarios); risk characterization (includes quantitative as 
well as qualitative assessment); ensuring the quality of 
data used in such assessment and risk evaluation. The risk 

117 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
assessor is obliged to search beyond the application to 
identify additional data and other information that will help 
in the completion of the risk assessment.  
(d) The next stage of Risk Management includes preparing a 
risk 
management 
plan; 
and 
monitoring/reviewing 
measures, if any, to assess the effectiveness of all steps in 
risk analysis, including post-release review. It further 
provides that in case of non-compliance of any condition 
considered necessary to manage the risk associated with 
the environmental release and imposed by the regulatory 
authorities, the Regulatory Authorities may investigate the 
nature and extent of such non-compliance. If proven, resort 
may be made to the EPA, 1986 which provides for a range 
of remedies, including provisions for criminal sanctions or 
large fines and/or imprisonment for failing to abide by the 
legislation, conditions or directions when significant 
damage occurs to health and safety of people or the 
environment. 
(e) Another relevant aspect dealt in this document is Risk 
Communication which is a two-way process ‘to provide, 

118 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
share or obtain information and to engage in dialogue with 
stakeholders regarding the analysis of risk’ and Risk 
perception. This is based on a principle that Risk 
Assessment should be ‘in a scientifically sound and 
transparent manner’. It includes engagement of ‘internal 
and external stakeholders in the risk analysis process 
through dialogue’; informing so as ‘to foster understanding 
of the risks amongst different constituencies (e.g., 
authorized parties and others from the regulated 
community, as well as researchers, farmers, health 
workers, industry, consumers, interest groups and the 
general community)’; and building trust ‘to promote trust 
and credibility in the ability of the Regulatory Agencies and 
the Indian government to effectively regulate modern 
biotechnology’. 
(f) At this juncture, it becomes pertinent to refer to the 
Cartagena Protocol and the Risk Analysis Framework 
provided under Annex-III of the said Protocol. The General 
Principles that are required to be followed by the Parties in 
developing risk assessment are: 

119 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
“ ….. 
3. Risk assessment should be carried out in a 
scientifically sound and transparent manner, and can 
take into account expert advice of, and guidelines 
developed by, relevant international organizations. 
 
4. Lack of scientific knowledge or scientific consensus 
should not necessarily be interpreted as indicating a 
particular level of risk, an absence of risk, or an 
acceptable risk. 
 
5. Risks associated with living modified organisms or 
products thereof, namely, processed materials that 
are of living modified organism origin, containing 
detectable novel combinations of replicable genetic 
material obtained through the use of modern 
biotechnology, should be considered in the context of 
the risks posed by the non-modified recipients or 
parental organisms in the likely potential receiving 
environment. 
 
6. Risk assessment should be carried out on a case-
by-case basis. The required information may vary in 
nature and level of detail from case to case, depending 
on the living modified organism concerned, its 
intended use and the likely potential receiving 
environment.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
(g) The steps provided under this Protocol for risk assessment: 
 
“8. To fulfil its objective, risk assessment entails, as 
appropriate, the following steps: 
 
(a) An identification of any novel genotypic and 
phenotypic characteristics associated with the living 
modified organism that may have adverse effects on 
biological diversity in the likely potential receiving 
environment, taking also into account risks to human 
health; 
 

120 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
(b) An evaluation of the likelihood of these adverse 
effects being realized, taking into account the level 
and kind of exposure of the likely potential receiving 
environment to the living modified organism; 
 
(c) An evaluation of the consequences should these 
adverse effects be realized; 
 
(d) An estimation of the overall risk posed by the living 
modified organism based on the evaluation of the 
likelihood and consequences of the identified adverse 
effects being realized; 
 
(e) A recommendation as to whether or not the risks 
are acceptable or manageable, including, where 
necessary, identification of strategies to manage these 
risks; and 
 
(f) Where there is uncertainty regarding the level of 
risk, it may be addressed by requesting further 
information on the specific issues of concern or by 
implementing 
appropriate 
risk 
management 
strategies and/or monitoring the living modified 
organism in the receiving environment.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
(h) After perusing the Cartagena Protocol and the Risk 
Analysis 
Framework 
developed 
by 
the 
concerned 
ministries, it is safe to deduce that Indian regulatory 
system has a sufficient and robust framework of risk 
analysis/assessment which can be used by the regulatory 
authorities to protect the health and ensure safety of the 
people as well as the environment, in accordance with 

121 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
EPA,1986 ; also to foster the research and development in 
the field of GE plants. 
 
iii. Regulations and Guidelines for Recombinant DNA and 
Biocontainment, 2017 
 
(a) These guidelines were issued on 1st April 2018 with the 
following objectives: 
“i. Outline the general principles of containment and 
establish a minimum standard for laboratories that 
must be adopted pan India for all handling of 
genetically engineered (GE) organisms (organism 
includes 
microorganisms, 
animals, 
plants, 
arthropods, aquatic animals, etc.) and non-genetically 
engineered 
(non-GE) 
hazardous 
microorganisms 
(microorganism includes parasites, protozoa, algae, 
fungi, bacteria, virus, prions, etc.). 
 
ii. Identify the levels of risk(s) associated with GE 
organisms and non-GE hazardous microorganisms 
and classification of those organisms into their 
respective 
risk 
groups 
to 
select 
appropriate 
containment facilities. It also covers certification of 
containment facilities. 
 
iii. Prescribe criteria for Manufacture, Use, Import, 
Export, Exchange and Storage of any hazardous 
microorganisms, GE organisms or cells and products) 
produce through exploration of such organisms. 
 
iv. Ensure that national authorities, institutions and 
all other stakeholders involved in research & 
development are well informed or have access to 
information on safety thereby facilitating the safe use 
and handling of hazardous microorganisms, GE 
organisms or cells and product(s) produce through 
exploration of such organisms.

informed about the containment strategies followed in

“SCOPE 
 
This document covers regulatory scope on rDNA 
research and handling of hazardous microorganisms 
and GE organisms or cells in India. 
 
Adoption of these guidelines shall be binding pan 
India for all public and private organisations involved 
in research, development and handling of GE 
organisms 
(organism 
includes 
microorganisms, 
animals, plants, arthropods, aquatic animals etc.) and 
non-GE hazardous microorganisms (microorganism 
includes parasites, protozoa, algae, fungi, bacteria, 
virus, prions, etc.) and products produced through 
exploration of such organisms. 
Note: These guidelines do not overwrite any other 
existing regulations or guidelines, unless specified 
here.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
(b) These guidelines are divided into 4 chapters- Chapter 1: 
Regulations and Competent Authorities; Chapter 2: 
Principles and Components of Containment; Chapter 3: 
Operational Guides on Containment; Chapter 4: 
Containment Requirement for Import, Export and 
Exchange. Each of these issues covered in the Chapter is 
dealt with in considerable detail and I have perused the 
same however refrain from dealing with them in extenso. 
 

123 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
iv. Guidelines and SOPs for confined field trials of 
Regulated, GE plants 2008 - The scope of these guidelines 
is defined as under: 
“These guidelines are intended to provide guidance to 
applicants for the conduct of confined trials. They are 
not intended to explicitly define all the requirements 
for the conduct of a confined field trial, as further 
terms and conditions/requirements may be identified 
during the review process by the Regulatory 
Authorities. This document covers all GE/transgenic 
plants modified through recombinant DNA (rDNA) 
technology.” 
 
32. It is in this background, having taken note of and considered the 
law, the relevant documents and all other essentialities, that the 
challenge raised by the Petitioners must be seen.  
 
33. The conditional approval, leading to field trials for DMH-11 is in 
line with a developmental approach, of a scientific temper. The 
same has been supplemented with conditions imposed by the 
expert 
body, 
to 
facilitate 
mitigating 
measures 
qua 
the 
environment, which I have discussed above.  
 
34. While examining the propriety of the conditional approval granted 
by the GEAC (to DMH-11) qua the precautionary principle, it 
becomes essential to look to the past orders of this Court, in these 

124 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
petitions, in order to understand the position taken, thus far, qua 
the activities of this body.  
(a) On 22.09.2006, the Court observed that on 01.05.2006, 
while issuing orders in an Interlocutory Application, held 
that all trials will be conducted only with the approval of 
the GEAC. On this date, it was further observed that the 
Court was not inclined to direct the stoppage of field trials 
but, it did direct a pause on approvals, subject to having 
heard all sides. 
(b) On 13.10.2006, as an interim measure, the Court 
permitted the applicant to plant DMH-11 variety for 
experimental purpose in its field subject to all precautions.  
(c) On 15.12.2006, on being presented with some information 
which questioned the permission to plant the DMH-11 
variety for testing, and a prayer regarding uprooting 
thereof, directions were issued to the GEAC to examine the 
impact of field tests being carried out, with reference to the 
experts referred to. An independent view was directed to be 
furnished by the GEAC. It was observed as under: 
 

125 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
“Today, our attention has been drawn by the learned 
counsel for the petitioner to clause (23) of the 
Convention on Biological Diversity which, inter alia, 
recommends that in the current absence of reliable 
data on genetic use restriction technologies [GURT], 
without which there is an inadequate basis on which 
to assess their potential risks, and in accordance with 
the precautionary approach, products incorporating 
such technologies should not be approved by parties 
or field testing until appropriate scientific data can 
justify such testing. Further, reliance has been placed 
on the expert opinion of Professor Joe Cummins, 
Professor Jack Heinemann and Professor Dough 
Gurian 
Sherman 
to 
contend 
that 
barnase 
unaccompanied by its specific inhibitor barstar is 
known to be a potent cell poison. Traces of barnase 
are toxic to the rat kidney and to human cell lines. 
Barnase is actually being exploited as a conditional 
suicide gene to cause cell death in mammalian and 
human cells when it is induced, and cell toxicity 
caused by barnase may be affected by RNA 
interference. Relying on these experts, learned 
counsel contends that, as indicated in the order dated 
13th October, 2006, direction be issued for uprooting 
the plant otherwise risk is being run for permanent 
escape of the gene and other damages which it may 
cause. Before we consider this prayer further, we 
deem it appropriate to direct G.E.A.C. to examine in 
detail the impact of the field test being carried also 
with reference to the expert opinion. We may, 
however, note that the applicant’s case is that it has 
modified its technology and is not using GURT. We 
say nothing on this aspect. We expect independent 
expert opinion from G.E.A.C. on this subject.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
(d) On 08.05.2007, it was observed that in total, 91 field 
testing operations were being undertaken. It was further 
directed that- 

126 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
“The GEAC shall take sufficient precautions to see 
that these trials are not causing any contamination to 
the cultivation of neighboring fields. There should be 
at least 200 meters distance from the trial fields from 
the neighboring field having same type of cultivations. 
All the trials which are being conducted, the name of 
the scientist and other details who will be responsible 
for all aspects of the trials should be reported to GEAC 
and they should be regular supervision by them. Prior 
to bringing out the GM material from the green house 
for conduct of open field trials, the approved 
institution should submit a validated event specific 
test protocol at an LOD of at least 0.01% to detect and 
confirm that there has been no contamination… 
GEAC should also verify whether these species by 
commercial use create any toxicity or allergenicity to 
any of the users in organic conducted with these 
varieties of Bt cotton. If any such test has been 
conducted, the data should be made available to this 
Court.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
(e) On 13.02.2008, the restriction placed by this Court upon 
granting approvals was lifted and GEAC was permitted to 
consider all applications. To assuage the worries of the 
Petitioner in regard to the proper constitution of the GEAC, 
the latter was requested to invite Dr. P.M. Bhargava and 
Prof. M.S. Swaminathan to its meetings. It was further 
observed that if any person was dissatisfied by the decision 
arrived at by the Committee, an appeal may be preferred to 
the Appellate Committee and, that the apprehensions in 

127 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
regard to negative effect of open field trials, be also 
considered by the Committee. It was further directed that 
the guidelines to grant approvals be published on the 
website of the Committee. 
 
(f) On 07.10.2016, this Court recorded the submission of the 
Additional Solicitor General, that release was not allowed 
till 17.10.2016 because the Government had sought views 
from the public and after receiving public views/objections, 
the committee of experts would consider such matter. 
 
34.1 As the above referred orders point out, throughout the entire 
process of field testing, being taken stock of, at regular 
intervals by the Court, it has not, even for a moment doubted 
the authority of the GEAC and its ability to function properly. 
Repeatedly, it has been emphasised that the GEAC, being the 
apex 
body 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
taking 
all 
precautions/adopting safeguards and ensuring that no 
contamination takes place in planting of GM seeds.  
 
34.2 In one of the orders referred above, it has been noted that 91 
field trials were underway at one point. In the extensive 

128 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
arguments made by the Petitioners, not even a single negative 
instance could be pointed out to show that the field trials 
impacted the agriculture, environment, biodiversity negatively 
or irrevocably. Furthermore, as pointed out by the Union of 
India, trials of DMH-11 have commenced in 6 out of the 8 
sanctioned locations (seeds have been planted) and no adverse 
change therein has been reported thus far. The fears, raised 
by the Petitioners, therefore, are not substantiated by any 
negative occurrence.  
 
34.3 The members of the GEAC under the 1989 Rules, are experts 
in their relevant fields. The approval has come, as discussed 
above, in consonance with the relevant statutory framework. 
Furthermore, adequate safeguards have been included in the 
approval itself, in accordance with the precautionary principle. 
There is an additional ground, upon whose anvil, the decision 
to grant conditional approval as also the general introduction 
of GMOs into the sphere of common consumption, which has 
been sought to be banned by the present petitions, has to be 
weighed.  
 

129 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
35. Whether or not the State allows or disallows the scientific 
experimentation of a particular kind of crop, particularly when 
the Central Government is the primary authority entrusted with 
such function, is a decision squarely within their domain and the 
role of the Courts therein is circumscribed to the violation of 
fundamental rights; manifest arbitrariness; conflict with any 
other law and/or other grounds of similar nature. 
 
36. In reference to public interest, in this particular context, Article 
48 of the Directive Principle of the State Policy (hereinafter 
referred to as ‘DPSP’) would be instructive in order for the 
concerned branch of the Government to frame policy and take 
steps in this regard being whilst being entirely in line with the 
Constitution of India which undoubtedly is the source of all 
power, legitimacy and is the ultimate guide for all actions. It states 
that there shall be an endeavour to organise agriculture on 
modern and scientific lines. State of Gujarat v. Mirzapur Moti 
Kureshi Kassab Jamat (7-Judge Bench)43, observed:  
 
“Article 48 consists of two parts. The first part enjoins 
the State to “endeavour to organise agricultural and 
 
43 (2005) 8 SCC 534 

130 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
animal husbandry” and that too “on modern and 
scientific lines”. The emphasis is not only on 
“organisation” but also on “modern and scientific 
lines”. The subject is “agricultural and animal 
husbandry”.” 
 
 
37. A wholistically aware adoption of GMOs into agriculture appears 
to be in furtherance of this goal. The phrase ‘wholistically aware’ 
may require some exposition. What this means is that while 
GMOs are brought into the agricultural scene and eventually 
made available for commercial use, it should be so done keeping 
in mind the essentiality of preserving naturally occurring seeds, 
ensuring that all other factors such as health, socio-economic 
impact, environmental/biodiversity impact, accessibility to 
farmers, proper control and marking of such modified crops etc. 
would be required to be in place.   
 
38. In continuation to the above, reference has also to be made to 
Article 51A(h) of the Constitution of India which imposes a 
fundamental duty upon all in the following terms:  
 
“h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and 
the spirit of inquiry and reform;” 
 
 

131 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
38.1 This Court in AIIMS Students' Union v. AIIMS (3-Judge 
Bench)44 observed: 
 
“58. … Fundamental duties, as defined in Article 51-
A, are not made enforceable by a writ of court just as 
the fundamental rights are, but it cannot be lost sight 
of that “duties” in Part IV-A Article 51-A are prefixed 
by the same word “fundamental” which was prefixed 
by the founding fathers of the Constitution to “rights” 
in Part III. Every citizen of India is fundamentally 
obligated 
to 
develop 
a 
scientific 
temper 
and 
humanism. He is fundamentally duty-bound to strive 
towards excellence in all spheres of individual and 
collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to 
higher levels of endeavour and achievements. State is, 
all the citizens placed together and hence though 
Article 51-A does not expressly cast any fundamental 
duty on the State, the fact remains that the duty of 
every citizen of India is the collective duty of the State. 
… In the era of globalisation, where the nation as a 
whole has to compete with other nations of the world 
so as to survive, excellence cannot be given an 
unreasonable go-by and certainly not compromised in 
its 
entirety. 
Fundamental 
duties, 
though 
not 
enforceable by a writ of the court, yet provide a 
valuable 
guide 
and 
aid 
to 
interpretation 
of 
constitutional and legal issues. In case of doubt or 
choice, people's wish as manifested through Article 
51-A, can serve as a guide not only for resolving the 
issue but also for constructing or moulding the relief 
to be given by the courts. Constitutional enactment of 
fundamental duties, if it has to have any meaning, 
must be used by courts as a tool to tab, even a taboo, 
on State action drifting away from constitutional 
values.”

132 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
38.2 Similarly, in Charu Khurana v. Union of India (2-Judge 
Bench)45 , this Court observed:  
 
“32. The purpose of referring to the same is to 
understand 
and 
appreciate 
how 
the 
directive 
principles of State policy and the fundamental duties 
enshrined under Article 51-A have been elevated by 
the interpretative process of this Court. The directive 
principles have been regarded as the soul of the 
Constitution as India is a welfare State. At this 
juncture, it is apt to notice the view expressed by a 
two-Judge Bench of this Court in Ashoka Smokeless 
Coal India (P) Ltd. v. Union of India [(2007) 2 SCC 640] 
wherein it has been laid down that: (SCC p. 683, para 
106) 
 
“106. … the directive principles of State policy provide 
for a guidance to interpretation of fundamental rights 
of a citizen as also the statutory rights.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
39. The Union of India has submitted that comprehensive risk 
assessment qua GMOs cannot be done at the initial research 
stage and all consultations cannot take place for each application 
on GM crops at an early stage. It was further submitted that 
toxicology studies are varied on product by product basis, as per 
international best practices and therefore toxicity studies are 
undertaken as per guidelines on a case-by-case basis.  
 
 
45 (2015) 1 SCC 192 

133 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
40. The experimentation in respect of GMOs, i.e. field trials, lab 
testing etc. would be in line with the development of a scientific 
temper along with the precautionary principle which has found 
its place within Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Field trials 
are a significant step in the development of crop varieties as the 
data representing the plant’s response to a particular agro-
ecological environment can be collected only when such plant is 
grown outside in confined field trials. Without field trials, the 
performance of the plant in the field or environmental safety of 
such plant cannot be known. Studies, being conducted in open 
environment is necessary for studying the impact on human 
health and biodiversity, for the performance of a GM crop is 
dependent on a host environment. This would be essential to 
developing appropriate biosafety mechanisms as well.  
 
41.  The judgments referred above recognise fundamental duties as 
an important guide to interpretation of the Constitution, which 
obviously would apply to the understanding of Article 21 as well.  
In Ramlila Maidan Incident, In re (2-Judge Bench)46, the 
 
46 (2012) 5 SCC 1 

134 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
interdependency of the three parts of the constitution was 
highlighted by Swatanter Kumar J. (as he then was) in the 
following words: 
 
“22. Thus, a common thread runs through Parts III, 
IV and IV-A of the Constitution of India. One Part 
enumerates the fundamental rights, the second 
declares the fundamental principles of governance 
and the third lays down the fundamental duties of the 
citizens. While interpreting any of these provisions, it 
shall always be advisable to examine the scope and 
impact of such interpretation on all the three 
constitutional aspects emerging from these Parts.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
42. The development of scientific temper is to be read with another 
limb of the DPSPs and Fundamental Duties enshrined in the 
Constitution that is Article 48A and Article 51A(g) respectively 
which speaks of protection of the environment. As already noticed 
above, these three parts forming the heart and soul of the 
Constitution have to be read as a whole and as such any and all 
considerations of modernising agriculture or building a scientific 
temper would also be required to necessarily consider and abide 
by the duty to protect the environment.  
 

135 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
43. It is also to be noted that, similar to when a legislative body enacts 
a legislation there is a presumption of constitutionality unless 
proven otherwise, similarly, a policy decision when taken by the 
competent authority enters the fray of enforcement with a 
presumption in its favour of being in public interest, unless 
otherwise shown, demonstarted and proven to be among other  
grounds, manifestly arbitrary. This presumption extends, subject 
of course to just exceptions, to the authority having considered 
duties as discussed above in framing policies for GMOs. 
 
44. It must be kept in mind that India is a global agricultural 
powerhouse and from an economic standpoint, rural India is still 
largely dependent on agriculture. This court has stated in 
Electrosteels (supra) that the Court cannot be oblivious to the 
economy. Therefore, informed agricultural policy decisions must 
be viewed in that conspectus, which is to further and supplement 
India’s development, growth and self-sustenance. The relevance 
of such policy decisions being that, for instance, as submitted by 
the Union of India, India has been dependent on imports to meet 
more than half of the edible oil demand [55.76%, 155.33 Lakh 

136 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
Tonnes (2022-23) – Rs.1,15,000/- crores in 2020-21]. Therefore, 
in my view, the use of GM technology has to be seen in this 
backdrop.    
 
45. On numerous occassions, this Court has reiterated the view 
discussed in the preceding paragraphs.  
 
45.1 This Court in State of U.P. v. Abhay Nandan Inter College47 
(2-Judge Bench) observed: 
 
“36. A policy decision is presumed to be in public 
interest, and such a decision once made is not 
amenable to challenge, until and unless there is 
manifest or extreme arbitrariness, a constitutional 
court is expected to keep its hands off.” 
 
 
45.2 In State of Punjab v. Khan Chand48 (5-Judge Bench), KK 
Mathew J. dissenting, observed: 
“23. … Courts and parties all assume that the 
Legislature always wants protection of the public 
interest, to serve public cause and do things for public 
good or to exercise powers for public purpose and 
always intends that administrators act justly and 
reasonably whether the Legislature says so in the 
statute 
or 
not 
[see 
Kenneth 
Culp 
Davis, 
“Administrative Law Treatise”, (1958) Vol. I, p. 87]. 
Every legislative body must be presumed to favour the 
 
47 (2021) 15 SCC 600 
48 (1974) 1 SCC 549 

137 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
true, the good and above all the public interest and 
public good and whether it says so or not is of 
absolutely no consequence. …Government exists and 
its only title to exist is its claim to advance the public 
good and serve the public interest….” 
 
 
45.3 On similar lines, in Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. 
v. Brojo Nath Ganguly49 (2-Judge Bench) this Court 
observed: 
 
“92. …Public policy, however, is not the policy of a 
particular government. It connotes some matter 
which concerns the public good and the public 
interest. The concept of what is for the public good or 
in the public interest or what would be injurious or 
harmful to the public good or the public interest has 
varied from time to time…” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
45.4 In Premium Granites v. State of T.N50 (2-Judge Bench), it 
was observed: 
“54. It is not the domain of the court to embark upon 
unchartered ocean of public policy in an exercise to 
consider as to whether a particular public policy is 
wise or a better public policy can be evolved. Such 
exercise must be left to the discretion of the executive 
and legislative authorities as the case may be. The 
court is called upon to consider the validity of a public 
policy only when a challenge is made that such policy 
decision infringes fundamental rights guaranteed by 
the Constitution of India or any other statutory 
right…” 
 
 
49 (1986) 3 SCC 156 
50 (1994) 2 SCC 691  

138 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
45.5 In the well-known, Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of 
India51, (3-Judge Bench), this Court held: 
 
“229. It is now well settled that the courts, in the 
exercise of their jurisdiction, will not transgress into 
the field of policy decision. Whether to have an 
infrastructural project or not and what is the type of 
project to be undertaken and how it has to be 
executed, are part of policy-making process and the 
courts are ill-equipped to adjudicate on a policy 
decision so undertaken. The court, no doubt, has a 
duty to see that in the undertaking of a decision, no 
law is violated and people's fundamental rights are 
not 
transgressed 
upon 
except 
to 
the 
extent 
permissible under the Constitution. 
 
  
x 
 
 
x 
 
 
x 
 
233. …The courts must, therefore, act within their 
judicially permissible limitations to uphold the rule of 
law and harness their power in public interest. It is 
precisely for this reason that it has been consistently 
held by this Court that in matters of policy the court 
will not interfere. When there is a valid law requiring 
the Government to act in a particular manner the 
court ought not to, without striking down the law, give 
any direction which is not in accordance with law. In 
other words the court itself is not above the law.” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
45.6 Therefore, on this ground, interference by this Court would 
only be justified if it can be proven that the effect of such a 
decision standing would be detrimental to the public, against 
its interest and would ultimately impact the enjoyment of 
 
51 (2000) 10 SCC 664 

139 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, to a 
degree which would be impermissible. As has been 
demonstrated in the preceding paragraphs, that threshold 
cannot be said to have been breached. 
 
46. In view of the entire conspectus above, the field testing of DMH-
11, pursuant to the conditional approval of the GEAC, with 
sufficient safeguards and precautions, ought to continue and 
cannot be said to be violative of the precautionary principle and 
therefore, the constitutional challenge thereto, fails.  
 
47. Two additional aspects need to be clarified. Pursuant to the above 
discussion, when I consider the prayer made on behalf of the 
Petitioners, it is clear that whether or not there should be a 
complete ban on Ht crops is not something this Court can issue 
a direction on. Such a decision has to be taken, keeping in view 
the opinion of various experts who have the knowledge and ability 
to comprehend scientific literature on the point as also the views 
of those persons specifically tasked with taking decisions in such 
matters. Courts, only on the basis of material placed on record or 
the indirect understanding passed on to it through counsel, is not 

140 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
in a position to take an informed decision. If such a decision is 
taken, it would be completely foreign to the standards of judicial 
review as discussed above, for it is not within the Court’s purview 
to undertake cost benefit analysis of a policy decision of the 
executive.  
 
48. The aspect of India being a centre of origin or diversity qua 
mustard was laid considerable emphasis on by the learned 
counsel for the Petitioners, however this, in my considered view, 
is another prayer with which this Court cannot do justice by 
returning or not returning a finding. Counsel on both sides 
supplied research material to support their own stand which 
argued contrarian viewpoints in this regard and so, it would be 
best if minds equipped to undertake detailed studies to come to a 
conclusion, would be the ones to decide this important issue. 
 
Conclusions & Directions 
 
49. In view of the above discussion, the conclusions arrived at in the 
discussion above are that:  

141 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
i. Judicial review into the decision making of all bodies 
concerned with GMOs, is possible. 
ii. The question of ban on Ht crops is not warranted in view of 
the precautionary principle and it is a decision squarely 
within the domain of policy.   
iii. The composition of the GEAC is in accordance with the 
Rules, to which the challenge of constitutionality, has 
failed, and in the absence of any change in the Rules, no 
fault can be found with the same. 
iv. The decision of the GEAC to grant conditional approval is 
not vitiated by non-application of mind, or any other 
principle of law, on part of the body, which itself is an 
expert body.  
 
50. In view of the above, I deem it appropriate to give the following 
directions: 
50.1. Field trials of DMH-11, shall continue in strict consonance 
with the conditions imposed. The Union of India and statutory 
authorities shall continue to strictly monitor the same. In case 

142 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
of any adverse change in circumstances, the decision for field 
trials can be reviewed.  
 
50.2. GEAC to ensure that the conditions mentioned in the 
conditional approval of DMH-11 are strictly complied with by 
the applicant in letter and spirit. 
 
50.3. The GEAC to take into account all environmental factors before 
granting future approvals and make an endeavour to have 
specifically designated farms for field testing, in collaboration 
with the Union of India.  
 
50.4. All studies conducted and received while granting such 
approvals, to be uploaded on the website of the GEAC in a 
time-bound manner, in accordance with the mandate of law. 
The GEAC to ensure public participation in this process and 
wider publicity of the same to be facilitated. 
50.5. That apart, wider publicity should also be given to GMOs in 
general, enabling people to take a decision in regard thereto, 
keeping in view all factors and specifications.  
 

143 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
50.6. All decisions to be taken in regard to GMOs should endeavour 
to strictly follow “wholistically aware” approach which takes 
the preservation of naturally occurring seeds hand in hand 
with popularising Genetically Modified seeds. 
 
50.7. The 
condition 
imposed 
in 
this 
Court’s 
order 
dated        
08.05.2007 in respect of 200 meters distance being 
maintained between fields hosting GM crops versus those 
wherein regular seeds are planted, has to be strictly 
maintained. 
 
50.8. The Post-Release Monitoring Committee be provided with 
adequate infrastructural and administrative facilities to closely 
monitor the field testing. 
 
50.9. The Union of India may consider constituting a special cell 
under the MoEFCC to monitor all studies being undertaken 
with respect to GMO’s.  
 
50.10. Before commercial release of DMH-11 and other GMOs in the 
future, specific testing on their impact on human health must 
be conducted prior thereto. 

144 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
50.11. The GEAC or any other body, possessing sufficient expertise, 
duly notified by the government, to consider conducting 
independent studies on GMOs to ascertain the veracity of the 
data submitted by the applicant(s) so as to ensure that the 
approval so granted are bolstered by independent data 
informing such decision. 
 
50.12. The Union of India should consider implementing a national, 
all-encompassing policy in respect of GMOs so as to ensure a 
streamlined approach to this important issue. Connected 
thereto, is the setting up of infrastructure including 
laboratories with state of the art facilities, to aid the interplay 
of biotechnology and agriculture and the advancement thereof. 
 
50.13. Union of India to ensure strict compliance qua labelling of GM 
foods, in accordance with the Food Safety and Security Act.  
51. Before parting with the present lis, I lament the delay with which 
the present writ petition has come to be disposed. The genesis of 
this case was 20 years ago from the present day. The detrimental 
effect of such prolonged litigation was noted by this Court in 
Rajeev Suri (supra) wherein it was observed: 

145 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
 
“574…the underlying principle at play is the duty of 
this Court to do complete justice as envisaged under 
Article 142 and to obviate the possibility of project of 
national importance being stuck, embroiled and 
delayed due to engagement of the project proponent 
before multiple legal forums/proceedings. We have 
had plethora of cases in the post-PIL period wherein 
prolonged litigation against infrastructural projects 
resulted in inordinate delays to the extent that the 
projects got buried forever or became unviable owing 
to excessive burden on the public exchequer (honest 
taxpayers' money). That is where this Court's power 
to do not only complete but substantial justice gets 
triggered.

576. There is ample support to the proposition that 
when larger national interest is involved and concerns 
of public exchequer are directly involved in the lis, the 
Court must act at the earliest opportunity. For, each 
day's delay has a direct impact on the exchequer. In 
Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India [Narmada 
Bachao Andolan v. Union of India, (2000) 10 SCC 664] 
, the Court resonated this position and observed thus 
: (SCC pp. 761-62, para 227) 
 
“227. There are three stages with regard to the 
undertaking of an infrastructural project. One is 
conception or planning, second is decision to 
undertake the project and the third is the execution 
of the project. The conception and the decision to 
undertake a project is to be regarded as a policy 
decision. While there is always a need for such 
projects not being unduly delayed, it is at the same 
time expected that a thorough possible study will be 
undertaken before a decision is taken to start a 
project. Once such a considered decision is taken, the 
proper execution of the same should be undertaken 
expeditiously. It is for the Government to decide how 
to do its job. When it has put a system in place for the 
execution of a project and such a system cannot be 
said to be arbitrary, then the only role which a court 

146 | W.P. (C) 115 of 2004 & Ors. 
may have to play is to see that the system works in 
the manner it was envisaged.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
52. The above proposition resonates with the present case. 
Unfortunately, despite the national and public interest involved, 
this case remained pending for two decades, which must lead to 
introspection on both sides of the bench. 
 
53. I would like to place on record appreciation for all the counsel for 
taking us through the voluminous record and providing us with 
detailed hand-outs on the case file, which are purely a substance 
of their hard work.  
 
54. The writ petitions are dismissed and disposed of in terms of the 
above judgment. The contempt petitions stand closed in the above 
terms. The Civil Appeal stands disposed of in light of the above. 
Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
