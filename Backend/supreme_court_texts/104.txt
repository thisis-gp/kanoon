2. The appellants being aggrieved by the interim orders dated 
13.07.2023, 08.08.2023 and 13.09.2023 passed by the High Court of 
Judicature at Allahabad in Criminal Misc. Writ Petition Nos. 
10893/2023, 11837/2023 and 14053/2023 respectively, have 
preferred the instant appeals. Vide the impugned orders, the High 
Court has stayed the proceedings of the FIRs registered against the 
concerned respondents-accused as also stayed the proceedings of 
ECIR No.-ECIR/HIU-I/06/2023 registered by the Directorate of 
Enforcement against the concerned respondents, and further directed 
not to take any coercive action against the said respondents pending 
the said writ petitions. All the appeals being interconnected with each 
other, they were heard together and it would be appropriate to decide 
them by this common judgment. 
3. The respondent India Bulls Housing Finance Limited (IHFL) is a non-
banking financial institution incorporated under the provisions of the 
Companies Act. IHFL deals with the public money. The major source 
of funds for the loans to be advanced by IHFL, is either the loans from 
the other banks or from the public in the form of non-convertible 
debentures. The respondents Niraj Tyagi is the President (Legal) and 
Reena Bagga is the authorized officer of the IHFL.

4. M/s Kadam Developers Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as M/s 
Kadam) was one of the Shipra Group entities. M/s Kadam had a sub-
lease of a parcel of land admeasuring 73 acres in Sector 128, Noida, 
which was allotted to it by the predecessor of Yamuna Expressway 
Industrial Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as the 
YEIDA). The 100% equity shares of M/s Kadam were held by Shipra 
Estate Limited (98%); Mohit Singh (1%) and Bindu Singh (1%). 
5. Between 2017-2020, IHFL had sanctioned 16 loan facilities to the 
tune of Rs. 2,801 crores to the Shipra Group/ Borrowers comprising 
of Shipra Hotels Ltd., Shipra Estate Ltd. and Shipra Leasing Pvt. Ltd. 
for the purposes of the construction and/or development of 
Housing/Residential Projects. Against the said sanctioned loan, a 
sum of approximately 1995.37 crores was disbursed. The financial 
assistance was secured by the Shipra Group by executing 22 pledge 
agreements whereby the shares of various companies were pledged 
in favour of IHFL. A pledge agreement was also entered into by Shipra 
Groups and M/s Kadam with IHFL pledging 100% equity shares 
(dematerialized) of M/s Kadam to secure the loan. The mortgaged 
properties also included 73 acres of land at Noida that had been sub-

4 
 
let to M/s Kadam by YEIDA, and the property called ‘Shipra Mall’ in 
Ghaziabad.  
6. There being defaults in the repayment of loan amount, IHFL had 
issued notices recalling all the loans advanced to the Shipra Group 
amounting to Rs. 1763 crores (approx.). The said notices came to be 
challenged by the Shipra Group before the Delhi High Court, by filing 
FAO(OS) COMM 59/2021. The Delhi High Court vide order dated 
16.04.2021 recorded that IHFL could proceed further with the 
recovery proceedings, however the sale of shares should be done at 
a fair market value and in a transparent manner. It appears that a 
series of litigations under the SARFAESI Act before the DRT and High 
Court had ensued between the parties. 
7. IHFL on 01.07.2021 ultimately sold the shares of M/s Kadam pledged 
with it to one Final Step Developers P. Ltd., a subsidiary of M3M India 
P. Ltd. for Rs. 750 crores. Since Final Step Developers (earlier known 
as M/s Creative Soul Technology P. Ltd) had no source of funds of its 
own, the funds to purchase the shares of M/s Kadam were provided 
to the Final Step Developers by the M3M India, which managed to 
take loan from the IHFL on the same day i.e. 03.07.2021. Thus, the 
purchase of shares of M/s Kadam by Final Step from the IHFL was 

5 
 
funded by the IHFL itself. The mortgaged properties-Shipra Mall at 
Ghaziabad and the parcel of law admeasuring 73 acres at Noida also 
eventually came to be sold by the IHFL towards the recovery of its 
dues from the Shipra Group. 
8. On 09.04.2023, an FIR being No. 427 of 2023 came to be filed by one 
Amit Walia, a Director of Shipra Hotels, against IHFL and its officers 
for the offences under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B IPC, 323, 
504 & 506 at Police Station Indirapuram, alleging inter alia that IHFL 
had illegally showed the Shipra group to be the defaulters, so that 
they may misappropriate the properties owned by the Group through 
illegal means. The FIR also alleged that IHFL had conspired with M3M 
India, and by forging and fabricating the documents sold 73 acres of 
land of M/s Kadam to M3M India, for a sum of 300 crores when the 
market value of the same was about 4000 crores. IHFL had also 
undervalued the shares and securities on the basis of false and forged 
documents and had caused great loss to the Shipra Estate Company 
and its Directors. 
9. On 15.04.2023, another FIR being No. 197 of 2023 came to be filed 
by YEIDA against IHFL, M3M India, M/s Kadam and M/s Beacon 
Trusteeship Ltd. for the offences under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 

6 
 
and 120-B at Police Station Beta-2, Greater Noida alleging inter alia 
that the first charge of YEIDA was preserved in the permission issued 
on 09.01.2018 for pledging the shares to IHFL however, the IHFL 
neither informed nor sought any permission of YEIDA before 
transferring the shares of M/s Kadam to M3M India. Thus, the terms 
and conditions contained in the permission letter, indemnity certificate 
and sub-lease document were violated by the financial institution and 
the sub-lessee, due to which the YEIDA had suffered a financial loss 
of about Rs. 200 crores. 
10. On 22.07.2023, yet another FIR being No. 611 of 2023 came to be 
filed by one Mohit Singh, authorized representative of Shipra Group, 
against Reena Bagga in her capacity as an authorized officer of IHFL 
and others for the offences under Section 420, 120B IPC and 82 of 
Registration Act at Police Station Kavi Nagar, Ghaziabad, alleging 
therein that “Shipra Mall”, which formed a part of the properties 
mortgaged with IHFL, had been sold in pursuance of recovery 
proceedings on the basis of false and fabricated documents, for a sum 
of Rs. 551 Crore to Himri Estate Pvt. Ltd. although the actual value of 
the land was over 2000 crore. It has been alleged that illegalities were 

7 
 
committed by the said accused, by not showing the actual value of 
Shipra Mall and thereby had caused huge loss to the Shipra Group. 
11.  Since various FIRs came to be registered against the IHFL and its 
officers, the same came to be challenged by them by filing the W.P. 
(Crl) being no. 166 of 2023 before this Court (Gagan Banga and Anr. 
vs. State of West Bengal and Ors.).  
12. Pending the said W.P. No.166/2023, the Directorate of Enforcement 
(ED) on the basis of the said FIR nos. 197/2023 and 427/2023 
registered an ECIR bearing no. ECIR/HIU-I/06/2023 in Delhi on 
09.06.2023, to investigate into the offences of money laundering 
under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. 
13.  According to the appellant-ED, this Court without giving the appellant 
any opportunity of hearing, passed the following order on 04.07.2023 
while disposing off the W.P. (Crl) No. 166/2023 and connected 
Contempt Petition.  
“1 to 3.…… 
 
4. Vide order dated 28.04.2023 passed in W.P. (Crl.) No. 
166/2023, criminal proceedings in three such FIRs instituted by 
borrowers in different States, namely FIR No. 646/2022 dated 
26.10.2022 registered at P.S. Titagarh, FIR No. 427/2023 dated 
09.04.2023 registered at P.S. Indirapuram and FIR No. 25/2021 
dated 27.01.2021 registered at P.S. EOW, Delhi were stayed. 
  
5. Further FIR No. 197/2023 dated 15.04.2023 was filed by 
YEIDA at PS Beta-2, Greater Noida, UP, which also refers to the 

8 
 
aforesaid FIR No. 427/2023 dated 09.04.2023 registered at P.S. 
Indirapuram with some overlapping facts. It is stated that on the 
basis of these two connected FIRs namely FIR No. 427/2023 and 
197/2023, now the ED has registered ECIR bearing No. 
ECIR/HIU-I/06/2023 in Delhi. The petitioners have now 
challenged the said FIRs and ECIR.  
 
6. In the circumstances, as it may also involve adjudication on 
facts, we deem it appropriate to permit the petitioners to 
approach the respective jurisdictional High Courts to challenge 
all four FIRs and the ECIR within two weeks from today, with a 
request to the respective High Courts to consider and decide the 
petitions expeditiously, not later than six months of their 
presentation.  
 
7. We also direct DGPs of respective States to look into the 
matter, examine the contentions of the petitioners in respect of 
the contents of FIRs, and to take appropriate measures in 
accordance with law within a period of one month. 
  
8. Till final disposal of the respective petitions, interim order dated 
28.04.2023 passed in W.P.(Crl.) No. 166/2023 would continue in 
the three FIRs mentioned therein.  
 
9. In so far as the further FIR No. 197/2023 dated 15.04.2023 
filed by YEIDA and ECIR bearing No. ECIR/HIU-I/06/2023 are 
concerned, no coercive steps would be taken against the 
petitioner financial institution and its officers, representatives and 
managers till final disposal of such petitions by the High Court, 
and it would be open for the petitioners to seek stay of 
proceedings which would be considered by the High Court on its 
own merits. It is clarified that this interim protection would only be 
applicable to the petitioner financial institution and its officers, 
representatives and managers, and not to any other person.” 
 
 
14.  The respondent-Niraj Tyagi and IHFL thereafter filed a writ petition in 
the High Court being Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 10893/2023 
seeking issuance of appropriate writ, order and direction for declaring 
Section 420 of IPC as arbitrary and ultra vires to the Constitution of India 
and seeking quashing of the FIR No.197 of 2023 dated 15.04.2023 as 

9 
 
also the consequential proceedings arising therefrom as initiated by the 
ED in ECIR bearing No. ECIR/HIU-I/06/2023. Similarly, the respondent 
Reena Bagga and IHFL filed another writ petition being Criminal 
Miscellaneous Writ Petition No. 11837/2023 seeking quashing of the FIR 
being No.611/2023 registered against them as also all the consequential 
actions taken by any authority/agency in pursuance to the said FIR. The 
respondent M3M India Pvt. Ltd. and Kadam Developers Pvt. Ltd. also 
filed a writ petition being Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No.14053/2023 
seeking the reliefs similar to the reliefs prayed for in the Writ Petition 
No.10893/2023.  
15. The High Court passed the following impugned Order on 13.07.2023 in 
Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No.10893 of 2023: -  
“19.  In view of the above, we are of the opinion that the 
petitioners have made out a case for grant of the interim as relief 
prayed for. Accordingly, in furtherance of the protection granted 
by the Apex Court to the petitioners by the order dated 4th July, 
2023, while disposing of the Contempt Petition (Civil) No. 774 of 
2023, it is provided that further proceedings, including 
summoning of the officers, consequent to the F.I.R. No. 197 of 
2023 dated 15.4.2023 under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471  and 
120-B - IPC, Police Station Beta-2, Greater Noida, Gautam Budh 
Nagar, registered by Respondent No.2 and consequent ECIR 
No. ECIR/HIU-I/06/2023 registered by  Respondent No. 4, shall 
remain stayed so far as it confines to the petitioners only and no 
coercive action shall be taken against them.” 
 

10 
 
16. The High Court passed the other impugned orders on 08.08.2023 in 
Criminal Miscellaneous Writ Petition No.11837/2023 and on 13.09.2023 
in Criminal Miscellaneous Writ Petition No.14053/2023, following the 
order 
dated 
13.07.2023 
passed 
in 
Writ 
Petition 
No.10893/2023.Consequently, the proceedings of the FIR No.197/2023, 
FIR No.611/23 as also the ECIR No. ECIR/HIU-I/06/2023 have been 
stayed qua the concerned respondents herein pending the said three 
writ petitions before the High Court, and the concerned respondents who 
are the accused in the said FIRs have been protected from any coercive 
action being taken against them. The present appeals stem out of the 
aforesaid impugned orders passed by the High Court. 
17.  The ASG, Mr. Raju appearing for the appellant ED in all the three 
appeals vehemently submitted that this Court had passed the order 
dated 04.07.2023 in Gagan Banga’s case staying the proceedings of 
ECIR and the FIRs registered against the concerned respondents 
without hearing the ED, and therefore the ED has filed a Review Petition, 
which is pending before this Court. He further submitted that the High 
Court also without assigning any cogent reasons in the impugned orders 
stayed the said proceedings of ECIR and FIRs under the guise of 
following the said order dated 04.07.2023 passed by this Court. Placing 

11 
 
heavy reliance on the decision of the Three-Judge Bench in Neeharika 
Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra and Others1,  he 
submitted that this Court has strongly deprecated the practice of the 
courts granting interim orders staying the investigation or directing the 
investigating agencies not to take coercive actions against the accused. 
The impugned orders passed by the High Court therefore being in the 
teeth of the said settled legal position, the same deserve to be quashed 
and set aside forthwith. 
18.  However, the learned Senior counsels appearing for the respondents in 
the respective appeals, taking the Court to the proceedings which had 
taken place under the SARFAESI Act and before the High Court and this 
Court, submitted that the respondent-complainant Shipra Group having 
failed in all the said proceedings had taken recourse to the criminal 
proceedings to create a fear amongst the financial institution and its 
officers. They further submitted that the High Court taking into 
consideration the order passed by this Court in Gagan Banga’s case 
had rightly protected the financial institution and its officers who had 
discharged their duties for the recovery of the dues from the borrowers. 
Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in K. Virupaksha and 
 
1 (2021) SCC Online SC 315 

12 
 
Another vs. State of Karnataka and Another2 and in A.P. Mahesh 
Cooperative Urban Bank Shareholders Welfare Association vs. 
Ramesh Kumar Bung and Others3, to submit that even in case of 
Neeharika Infrastructure (supra), the discretion has been conferred on 
the High Court to pass the interim orders in exceptional cases for not 
taking coercive steps against the accused pending the proceedings, 
particularly when the proceedings under the SARFAESI Act were 
initiated against the borrowers. According to them, bypassing the 
statutory remedies available to the borrowers or having failed in such 
proceedings, the borrowers should not be permitted to prosecute the 
financial institution or its officers or the purchasers just to instill a fear in 
their mind, which otherwise would have the potentiality to affect the 
marrows of economic health of the nation. 
19.  At the outset, it may be noted that the impugned interim orders have 
been passed by the High Court under the umbrella of the order dated 
04.07.2023 passed by this Court in Gagan Banga’s case, creating an 
impression that the impugned orders were passed in furtherance of the 
 
2  (2020) 4 SCC 440 
3  (2021) 9 SCC 152 

13 
 
said order, though this Court had passed the said order leaving it open 
to the High Court to decide the writ petitions on their own merits. 
20. In our opinion, it’s a matter of serious concern that despite the legal 
position settled by this Court in catena of decisions, the High Court has 
passed the impugned orders staying the investigations of the FIRs and 
ECIR in question in utter disregard of the said settled legal position. 
Without undermining the powers of the High Court under Section 482 of 
Cr.PC to quash the proceedings if the allegations made in the FIR or 
complaint prima facie do not constitute any offence against the accused, 
or if the criminal proceedings are found to be manifestly malafide or 
malicious, instituted with ulterior motive etc., we are of the opinion that 
the High Court could not have stayed the investigations and restrained 
the investigating agencies from investigating into the cognizable 
offences as alleged in the FIRs and the ECIR, particularly when the 
investigations were at a very nascent stage. It hardly needs to be 
reiterated that the inherent powers under Section 482 of Cr.PC do not 
confer any arbitrary jurisdiction on the High Court to act according to 
whims or caprice. The statutory power has to be exercised sparingly with 
circumspection and in the rarest of rare cases. In a way, by passing such 
orders of staying the investigations and restraining the investigating 

14 
 
agencies from taking any coercive measure against the accused 
pending the petitions under Section 482 Cr.PC, the High Court has 
granted blanket orders restraining the arrest without the accused 
applying for the anticipatory bail under Section 438 of Cr.PC.  
21. This Court in State of Telangana vs. Habib Abdullah Jeelani and 
Others4, while dealing with the contours of Section 482 and 438 Cr.PC 
had emphasized that the direction not to arrest the accused or not to 
take coercive action against the accused in the proceedings under 
Section 482 Cr.PC, would amount to an order under Section 438 Cr.PC, 
albeit without satisfaction of the conditions of the said provision, which 
is legally unacceptable.  
22.  Recently, a Three-Judge Bench in Neeharika Infrastructure (supra) 
while strongly deprecating the practice of the High Courts in staying the 
investigations or directing not to take coercive action against the accused 
pending petitions under Section 482 of Cr.PC, has issued the guidelines, 
which may be reproduced hereinbelow for ready reference:- 
“Conclusions 
33. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, our 
final conclusions on the principal/core issue, whether the High 
Court would be justified in passing an interim order of stay of 
investigation and/or “no coercive steps to be adopted”, during the 
pendency of the quashing petition under Section 482CrPC 
 
4 2017 (2) SCC 779 

15 
 
and/or under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and in what 
circumstances and whether the High Court would be justified in 
passing the order of not to arrest the accused or “no coercive 
steps to be adopted” during the investigation or till the final 
report/charge-sheet is filed under Section 173CrPC, while 
dismissing/disposing 
of/not 
entertaining/not 
quashing 
the 
criminal proceedings/complaint/FIR in exercise of powers under 
Section 482CrPC and/or under Article 226 of the Constitution of 
India, our final conclusions are as under: 
 
33.1. Police has the statutory right and duty under the relevant 
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure contained in 
Chapter XIV of the Code to investigate into a cognizable offence. 
 
33.2. Courts would not thwart any investigation into the 
cognizable offences. 
 
33.3. It is only in cases where no cognizable offence or offence 
of any kind is disclosed in the first information report that the 
Court will not permit an investigation to go on. 
 
33.4. The power of quashing should be exercised sparingly with 
circumspection, as it has been observed, in the “rarest of rare 
cases” (not to be confused with the formation in the context of 
death penalty). 
 
33.5. While examining an FIR/complaint, quashing of which is 
sought, the court cannot embark upon an enquiry as to the 
reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in 
the FIR/complaint. 
 
33.6. Criminal proceedings ought not to be scuttled at the initial 
stage. 
 
33.7. Quashing of a complaint/FIR should be an exception rather 
than an ordinary rule. 
 
33.8. Ordinarily, the courts are barred from usurping the 
jurisdiction of the police, since the two organs of the State 
operate in two specific spheres of activities and one ought not to 
tread over the other sphere. 
 
33.9. The functions of the judiciary and the police are 
complementary, not overlapping. 

16 
 
 
33.10. Save in exceptional cases where non-interference would 
result in miscarriage of justice, the Court and the judicial process 
should not interfere at the stage of investigation of offences. 
 
33.11. Extraordinary and inherent powers of the Court do not 
confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the Court to act according to its 
whims or caprice. 
 
33.12. The first information report is not an encyclopaedia which 
must disclose all facts and details relating to the offence reported. 
Therefore, when the investigation by the police is in progress, the 
court should not go into the merits of the allegations in the FIR. 
Police must be permitted to complete the investigation. It would 
be premature to pronounce the conclusion based on hazy facts 
that the complaint/FIR does not deserve to be investigated or that 
it amounts to abuse of process of law. After investigation, if the 
investigating officer finds that there is no substance in the 
application made by the complainant, the investigating officer 
may file an appropriate report/summary before the learned 
Magistrate which may be considered by the learned Magistrate 
in accordance with the known procedure. 
 
33.13. The power under Section 482CrPC is very wide, but 
conferment of wide power requires the court to be more cautious. 
It casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the court. 
 
33.14. However, at the same time, the court, if it thinks fit, regard 
being had to the parameters of quashing and the self-restraint 
imposed by law, more particularly the parameters laid down by 
this Court in R.P. Kapur [R.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab, 1960 
SCC OnLine SC 21 : AIR 1960 SC 866] and Bhajan Lal [State of 
Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 
426] , has the jurisdiction to quash the FIR/complaint. 
 
33.15. When a prayer for quashing the FIR is made by the 
alleged accused and the court when it exercises the power under 
Section 482CrPC, only has to consider whether the allegations 
in the FIR disclose commission of a cognizable offence or not. 
The court is not required to consider on merits whether or not the 
merits of the allegations make out a cognizable offence and the 
court has to permit the investigating agency/police to investigate 
the allegations in the FIR. 

17 
 
33.16. The aforesaid parameters would be applicable and/or the 
aforesaid aspects are required to be considered by the High 
Court while passing an interim order in a quashing petition in 
exercise of powers under Section 482CrPC and/or under Article 
226 of the Constitution of India. However, an interim order of stay 
of investigation during the pendency of the quashing petition can 
be passed with circumspection. Such an interim order should not 
require to be passed routinely, casually and/or mechanically. 
Normally, when the investigation is in progress and the facts are 
hazy and the entire evidence/material is not before the High 
Court, the High Court should restrain itself from passing the 
interim order of not to arrest or “no coercive steps to be adopted” 
and the accused should be relegated to apply for anticipatory bail 
under Section 438CrPC before the competent court. The High 
Court shall not and as such is not justified in passing the order of 
not to arrest and/or “no coercive steps” either during the 
investigation or till the investigation is completed and/or till the 
final report/charge-sheet is filed under Section 173CrPC, while 
dismissing/disposing of the quashing petition under Section 
482CrPC and/or under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. 
 
33.17. Even in a case where the High Court is prima facie of the 
opinion that an exceptional case is made out for grant of interim 
stay of further investigation, after considering the broad 
parameters while exercising the powers under Section 482CrPC 
and/or under Article 226 of the Constitution of India referred to 
hereinabove, the High Court has to give brief reasons why such 
an interim order is warranted and/or is required to be passed so 
that it can demonstrate the application of mind by the Court and 
the higher forum can consider what was weighed with the High 
Court while passing such an interim order. 
 
33.18. Whenever an interim order is passed by the High Court of 
“no coercive steps to be adopted” within the aforesaid 
parameters, the High Court must clarify what does it mean by “no 
coercive steps to be adopted” as the term “no coercive steps to 
be adopted” can be said to be too vague and/or broad which can 
be misunderstood and/or misapplied.” 
 
 
23.  The impugned orders passed by the High Court are in utter disregard 
and in the teeth of the said guidelines issued by the Three-Judge Bench 

18 
 
of this Court. It was sought to be submitted by the Learned Counsels for 
the respondents-accused that the allegations made in the FIRs are of civil 
nature, and have been given a colour of criminal nature. According to 
them, as discernible from the record, number of proceedings had ensued 
between the parties pursuant to the actions taken by the IHFL against the 
complainant-borrower for the recovery of its dues under the SARFAESI 
Act, and the borrower M/s Shipra after having failed in the said 
proceedings had filed the complaints with ulterior motives. We do not 
propose to examine the merits of the said submissions as the writ 
petitions filed by the concerned respondents-accused seeking quashing 
of the FIRs on such grounds are pending for consideration before the 
High Court. It would be open for the High Court to examine the merits of 
the petitions and decide the same in accordance with law.  
24. Without elaborating any further, suffice it to say that judicial comity and 
judicial discipline demands that higher courts should follow the law. The 
extraordinary and inherent powers of the court do not confer any arbitrary 
jurisdiction on the court to act according to its whims and caprice.  
25. The impugned orders passed by the High Court being not in consonance 
with the settled legal position, the same deserve to be set aside and are 
hereby set aside. The impugned interim orders passed by the High Court

qua the concerned respondents-accused in the present appeals stand 
vacated forthwith. 
26. We may clarify that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of 
the Writ Petitions which are pending before the High Court, and that it 
would be open for the concerned respondents-accused to take all legal 
contentions or take recourse to the legal remedies as may be available 
to them in accordance with law. 
27.  The appeals stand allowed accordingly.
