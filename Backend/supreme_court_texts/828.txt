                    Civil Appeal Nos. 7709-7710/2023                                                     Page 2 of 12 
 
 
dissolution, settlement of accounts and distribution of 
shares of a partnership firm, namely, Crystal Transport 
Service (for short the firm); (b) appointment of receiver to 
take charge of the management and assets of the firm 
till it is wound up; and (c) restraining the defendants 
from recovering, receiving or disposing of the property 
and effects of the firm. 
3. 
 The plaint case, inter alia, was that -- the firm was 
constituted in 1972-73 with four partners (i.e., the 
original plaintiff and defendants 1 to 3) each having one-
fourth share; the partnership was at will; in 1978, 
without the consent of the plaintiff, defendants 1 to 3 
diverted funds of the firm to a private limited company 
(defendant no.4 - appellant no.1 herein); and when the 
plaintiff demanded accounts from defendants 1 to 3, 
they refused. Hence, the suit. 
4. 
 The appellants contested the suit, inter alia, 
claiming that - the firm was constituted on 07.07.1971, 
with effect from 01.05.1971; it was not a partnership at 
will; a joint stock company was formed with the approval 
of the partners including the plaintiff; and by agreement 
dated 25.06.1978 all assets and liabilities of the firm 
were transferred to the fourth defendant (appellant no.1 
herein).  
5. 
The trial court passed a preliminary decree on 
19.09.1988, inter alia, in the following terms: (i) the firm 
stands dissolved with effect from 07.10.1978 in terms of 

 
                 
                    Civil Appeal Nos. 7709-7710/2023                                                     Page 3 of 12 
 
 
Section 42(b) read with Section 44 (g) of the Indian 
Partnership Act, 19322; (ii) the plaintiff has one-fourth 
share in the firm; (iii) accounts shall be taken up to the 
date of dissolution as per Order XX Rule 15 of the Code 
of Civil Procedure, 19083 ; (iv) defendants 1 to 3 shall, 
inter alia, file statement of final accounts along with a 
balance sheet and a profit and loss account duly audited 
for the last 5 years since before the date of dissolution; 
(v) the prayer for appointment of a Receiver shall be 
considered after the final accounts, balance sheet,  etc. 
are filed; (vi) suit against the fourth defendant (first 
appellant herein) is dismissed; and (vii) both sides shall 
bear their own costs. 
6. 
Aggrieved with the trial court decree, the original 
plaintiff preferred First Appeal No.215 of 1988. The 
appeal was allowed vide judgment and order dated 
08.08.1989 pursuant to which a preliminary decree was 
drawn inter alia in the following terms: (i) the firm shall 
stand dissolved with effect from 15.11.1978 (i.e., date of 
institution of the suit); (ii) Sri C.S. Narasimhan Advocate 
would be the Commissioner to take accounts from 
01.05.1971 till 15.11.1978; (iii) while taking accounts 
the Commissioner shall have due regard to Sections 37 
and 48 of the 1932 Act; (iv) the Commissioner’s fee shall 
be 10% of gross collections; (v) defendants 1 and 2 shall

                    Civil Appeal Nos. 7709-7710/2023                                                     Page 4 of 12 
 
 
neither convert nor transfer or dispose of assets of the 
firm till the accounts are finally settled; and (vi) the 
decree shall bind the fourth defendant (i.e., the first 
appellant herein).  
7. 
A second appeal preferred against the appellate 
decree failed. Hence, the aforesaid preliminary decree 
attained finality.  
8. 
The Receiver/Commissioner appointed by the first 
appellate court could not comply with the task, therefore 
another Receiver was appointed. The defendants 
challenged the order changing the Receiver, which was 
disposed of by confirming his appointment with a 
direction that he would take charge of the management 
of Crystal Transport Pvt. Ltd. (i.e., the first appellant). 
Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, a civil revision was 
preferred before the High Court which was dismissed 
vide order dated 30.07.1991.  The defendants thereafter 
challenged the order of the High Court before this Court 
in Civil Appeal No.4856 of 1992 which was disposed of 
vide order dated 12.11.1992 in the following terms: 
“Leave granted. Counsel heard. 
By consent, it is directed that the court receiver to 
appoint the appellant as his agent to carry on the 
business of the company on such terms and 
conditions regarding royalty, security and other 
matters as he thinks fit. The receiver may also take 
such undertakings from the appellant as he thinks 
proper. The terms and conditions to be settled after 
giving both the parties an opportunity of being heard. 
In case the appellant is not willing to accept the 
agency to run the business on the terms and 

 
                 
                    Civil Appeal Nos. 7709-7710/2023                                                     Page 5 of 12 
 
 
conditions determined by the receiver, the receiver 
may make an application to the court for further 
directions.  
Appeal disposed of with no order as to costs.”  
 
9. 
Subsequently I.A. No.2176 of 1992 was filed by the 
original plaintiff for a direction to the Receiver to take 
possession of the firm. When the trial court found that 
proper steps were not taken by the Receiver, a fresh 
Receiver was appointed after removing the earlier 
Receiver. Appeal preferred against that order was 
dismissed. Still aggrieved, a revision petition was filed. 
In the meantime, the original plaintiff moved I.A. 
No.2004 of 1993 to summon the Receiver with reference 
to his report, which too was rejected. Another revision 
petition was filed against this order. Finally, on 
17.11.1998 both the aforesaid revisions were dismissed.  
10. In the meantime, original plaintiff had filed I.A. 
No.33 of 1995 under Order XX Rule 15 CPC for 
appointment of a Receiver to ascertain the exact amount 
payable to the original plaintiff and to pass a final decree 
in terms of the preliminary decree. On the said 
application, the trial court passed a final decree on 
23.04.2004 thereby holding that the plaintiff would be 
entitled to get a sum of Rs.1,10,815/- as full and final 
settlement of her one-fourth share to be paid by the 
fourth defendant (i.e., the first appellant) with 9% p.a. 
interest from 1978 till the date of the order with 

 
                 
                    Civil Appeal Nos. 7709-7710/2023                                                     Page 6 of 12 
 
 
subsequent interest upon the accrued amount at the 
rate of 6% p.a. till the date of disbursement. While 
passing the final decree the application of the original 
plaintiff to change the Receiver was rejected.  
11. Aggrieved with the final decree, the original plaintiff 
preferred First Appeal No.328 of 2005 inter alia claiming 
that the final decree was based on non-proven reports; 
objection to the report was not considered; documents 
submitted were not taken into consideration; and the 
prayer to change the Receiver was not properly dealt 
with. After hearing the parties, the High Court while 
allowing the appeal by the impugned order observed: 
 
“Therefore, it is seen that the court has considered the 
issues involved in the matter and proceeded to pass 
the final decree based only upon the inadmissible and 
unreliable documents projected by the respondents/ 
defendants as well as unreliable and unacceptable 
report of the Receiver and without providing an 
opportunity to the petitioner/plaintiff to cross 
examine the authors of the aforesaid documents, 
namely, the auditors of the respondents/ defendants 
as well as the Receiver. Thus the endeavor of the court 
below to determine the amount payable to the 
petitioner /plaintiff based upon the abovesaid 
unreliable and inadmissible documents, cannot at all 
be countenanced as per law and when the court had 
come to the conclusion that the Receiver has not 
placed any proof as to (whether) he had filed his 
reports based on the actual scrutiny of the statement 
of accounts projected by the respondent/ defendants 
and also when it is seen that the court has not cared 
to advert to the evidence adduced by the petitioner / 
plaintiff in any manner as well as the various 
objections put forth by her to the report preferred by 
the Receiver as well as the statement of accounts 
submitted by her through her auditor Natarajan in 
any manner, in such view of the matter, in my 

 
                 
                    Civil Appeal Nos. 7709-7710/2023                                                     Page 7 of 12 
 
 
considered opinion, the final decree passed by the 
court below cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. 
……………….. 
I'm of the considered view that the matter requires 
remittance back to the trial court with the direction 
to the trial court to provide opportunities to both the 
parties to adduce further evidence particularly to 
sustain the statement of accounts rejected by them 
respectively by examining the authors of the same. 
The trial court is also further directed that 
considering the facts and circumstances of the case 
and after assessing and analyzing the further 
materials to be placed on record, if need be, if it still 
opines that the report of the receiver cannot be relied 
upon for one reason or the other and when the 
receiver had been appointed in this matter to only 
ascertain the income that could be derived during the 
relevant period for determining the share to be 
allowed to the petitioner / plaintiff, is empowered to 
examine the report filed by him and thereby provide 
opportunities to the parties concerned to cross 
examine him as to on what basis he had submitted 
his report. 
After the above said exercise, the court below is 
directed to accordingly appreciate the materials 
placed on record in the right perspective in 
accordance with the law and proceed with the 
contentions put forth by the respective parties in the 
matter and accordingly pass appropriate orders in the 
petition preferred by the petitioner /plaintiff for the 
appointment of a fresh Receiver for looking into the 
accounts of the firm and ascertaining the amount 
that is payable to her.” 
   
12. In the cross objection preferred by the appellants 
to the final decree their contention was that the 
preliminary decree of the first appellate court is the basis 
for passing the final decree. When the subject matter of 
the suit as well as the decree passed by the first 
appellate court is only with reference to the two buses 
and the decree also stipulates that the suit firm stood 

 
                 
                    Civil Appeal Nos. 7709-7710/2023                                                     Page 8 of 12 
 
 
dissolved on and from 15.11.1978 and the decree 
further directs only to take accounts from 01.05.1971 to 
15.11.1978, the trial court had erred in embarking upon 
an inquiry as regards the income that would have been 
derived even after 15.11.1978.   
13. The above argument was countered by the plaintiff 
by submitting that the assets of the firm had been taken 
over by the fourth defendant even before the plaintiff 
could realize the fruits of the decree, in such view of the 
matter, bearing in mind the provisions of Section 14 and 
37 of the 1932 Act, the profits generated even post 
dissolution of the firm would have to be accounted for by 
the fourth defendant till accounts are finally settled as 
per the final decree. 
14. The first appellate court accepted the aforesaid 
submissions made on behalf of the original plaintiff and 
rejected the cross-objection. The operative portion of the 
impugned order is extracted below: 
“In the light of the above said factors, the final (sic) 
decree order dated 23/4/2004 passed in I.A. No.33 of 
1995 in OS No.286 of 1978 on the file of the IInd 
Additional District Judge, Pondicherry is set aside in 
toto and the matter is remitted back to the trial court 
with the direction to provide opportunities to both the 
parties to adduce further evidence particularly to 
sustain the statement of accounts projected by them 
respectively by examining the authors of the same. 
The trial court is also further directed that 
considering the facts and circumstances of the case 
or the materials to be placed on record, if need be, if 
it still opines and concludes that the report of the 
Receiver cannot be relied upon for one reason or the 
other and when the receiver had been appointed in 

 
                 
                    Civil Appeal Nos. 7709-7710/2023                                                     Page 9 of 12 
 
 
this matter to only ascertain the income that could be 
derived during the relevant period for determining the 
share to be allowed to the petitioner / plaintiff, is 
empowered to examine him vis-a-vis the report filed 
by him and thereby provide opportunities to the 
parties concerned to cross examine him as to on what 
basis he had submitted his report. After the above 
said exercise, the court below is directed to 
accordingly appreciate the materials placed on record 
in the right perspective in accordance with law and 
proceed with the contentions put forth by the 
respective parties in the matter and accordingly pass 
appropriate orders as per law in the petition preferred 
by the petitioner /plaintiff for the appointment of a 
fresh commissioner/ receiver for looking into the 
accounts of the firm and ascertaining the amount 
that is payable to her. Accordingly, the first appeal 
and cross objection are disposed of.” 
   
 
 
SUBMISSIONS 
15. We have heard Mr. C. Aryama Sundaram for the 
appellants and Mr. Siddharth Naidu for the first 
respondent. 
16. At the outset, we may observe that there is no 
serious challenge to the findings returned in the 
impugned order that the parties were not given proper 
opportunity to prove as well as question the reports 
which formed the basis of the final decree. For this 
reason, as well as detailed reasons recorded in the 
impugned order as to why the matter was being 
remanded, we do not find a good ground to interfere with 
the remand order. 
17. However, the learned counsel for the appellants 
contended that once the partnership firm stood 
dissolved on 15.11.1978, when there was hardly any 

 
                 
                    Civil Appeal Nos. 7709-7710/2023                                                     Page 10 of 12 
 
 
property with the firm, there is no basis to seek for 
accounts and profits for the period beyond 15.11.1978. 
It is argued that liability cannot be fastened on the 
appellant company to share its profit for any period 
beyond 15.11.1978 i.e., the date of dissolution of the 
firm, particularly when the first appellant utilized no 
assets of the erstwhile firm. 
18. Per contra, the learned counsel for the plaintiff (the 
first respondent) submitted that final decree would have 
to be prepared in terms of the preliminary decree. The 
preliminary decree which is binding on the fourth 
defendant (i.e. the appellant-company) in clear terms 
states that assets of the firm were taken over by the 
fourth defendant (i.e., the first appellant herein).  In 
these circumstances as also that the impugned order is 
a remand order, no case for interference is made out. 
 
ANALYSIS 
19. Having considered the rival submissions and 
having perused the records, we notice that in the 
preliminary decree, inter alia, there is a clear direction to 
the following effect: 
“that in taking accounts the Commissioner shall have 
due regard to Section 37 and 48 of the Indian 
Partnership Act”. 
 
20. Section 37 of the 1932 Act reads thus: 
“Where any member of a firm has died or otherwise 
cease to be a partner, and the surviving or continuing 
partners carry on the business of the firm with the 

 
                 
                    Civil Appeal Nos. 7709-7710/2023                                                     Page 11 of 12 
 
 
property of the firm without any final settlement of 
accounts as between them and the outgoing partner 
or his estate, then, in the absence of a contract to the 
contrary, the outgoing partner or his estate is entitled 
at the option of himself or his representatives to such 
share of the profits made since he ceased to be a 
partner as may be attributable to the use of his share 
of the property of the firm or to interest at the rate of 
6% per annum on the amount of his share in the 
property of the firm:  
Provided that where by contract between the partners 
an option is given to surviving or continuing partners 
to purchase the interest of a deceased or outgoing 
partner, and that option is duly exercised, the estate 
of the deceased partner, or the outgoing partner or his 
estate, as the case may be, is not entitled to any 
further or other share of profits; but if any partner 
assuming to act in exercise of the option does not in 
all material aspects comply with the terms thereof, he 
is liable to account under the foregoing provisions of 
this section.” 
 
21. In the instant case, the finding, which appears on 
the record, is to the effect that the fourth defendant 
(appellant company) had taken over the assets of the 
firm.  Therefore, in light of the provisions of Section 37 
of the 1932 Act, if the fourth defendant is carrying on 
business with the assets of the firm, till a final 
settlement is made, the plaintiff, who would fall in the 
category of an outgoing partner, would have the right to 
seek for accounts and a share in the profits which might 
be derived from his share in the assets of the firm.  
22. As to what extent the business of the appellant 
company is derived from the assets of the firm is a 
matter of evidence which parties may have to adduce in 

 
                 
                    Civil Appeal Nos. 7709-7710/2023                                                     Page 12 of 12 
 
 
the course of the proceedings relating to the preparation 
of the final decree pursuant to the order of remand.  
 
CONCLUSION 
23. Considering that by the impugned order the matter 
has been remanded to the trial court, we do not find a 
good reason to interfere with the order impugned. We 
also observe that we have not expressed any binding 
opinion on the merits of the claim of either party as the 
same shall be subject to the evidence led by the parties 
during the course of the proceedings relating to the 
preparation of the final decree. 
24. Subject to above, the appeals are disposed of. 
25. Parties 
to 
bear 
their 
own 
costs. 
Pending 
application(s), if any shall stand disposed of.
