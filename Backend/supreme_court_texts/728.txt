The present appeal challenges the final judgment and order 
dated 1st September 2017 passed by the High Court of Judicature 
at Hyderabad for the State of Telangana and the State of Andhra 
Pradesh, whereby the High Court dismissed the Criminal Petition 
No. 5778 of 2016 filed by the accused persons, including the

appellants herein, under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC.” for short) thereby seeking quashing of 
the charge-sheet in C.C. No. 16 of 2014 on the file of Principal 
Special Judge for CBI Cases, Nampally, Hyderabad (“trial Court” 
for short). 
3. 
Shorn of details, the case of the prosecution is as given 
below. 
3.1 K. Suresh Kumar (Accused No. 1), the Sole Proprietor of M/s 
Sirish Traders, a firm engaged in processing of Uradh Dhall, 
was granted various credit facilities in the group loan account 
by the Indian Bank, Osmanganj Branch, Hyderabad 
(“respondent No. 2 Bank” for short). The credit facilities were 
secured by collateral security executed by the accused 
persons including the present appellants who are Accused 
No. 3 & 4.  
3.2 Since the borrowers/mortgagors (Accused Nos. 1-5) failed to 
service the interest and re-pay the dues, the group loan 
account was declared a Non-Performing Asset on 31st March 
2010.  

3 
3.3 To realize the outstanding amount, the respondent No. 2 
Bank filed an Original Application being OA No. 253 of 2010 
before the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Hyderabad (“DRT” for 
short) for recovery of amounts due. 
3.4 During the pendency of the proceedings before the DRT, the 
respondent No. 2 Bank came to know that some of the title 
documents executed by the accused persons by virtue of 
which equitable mortgage was created were not original 
documents, rather the same were fake, forged and fabricated.  
3.5 The respondent No. 2 Bank, accordingly, lodged a written 
complaint dated 3rd September 2012. Based on the said 
complaint, the Central Bureau of Investigation – Economic 
Offence Wing (CBI-EOW) Chennai registered an FIR No. 
RC.14/E/2012 dated 15th September 2012.  
3.6 The CBI-EOW Chennai after investigation prima facie found 
that offences punishable under Sections 120-B read with 
420, 409, 467, 468 and 471 of Indian Penal Code 1860 (“IPC” 
for short) and Section 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the Prevention of 
Corruption Act 1988 (“PC Act” for short) have been 

4 
committed. The CBI filed charge-sheet dated 27th December 
2013 in the trial Court and prayed that the trial Court take 
cognizance of the said offences committed by the accused 
persons. 
3.7 Since the proceedings before the DRT were still pending, the 
borrowers/mortgagors (Accused Nos. 1-5) approached the 
respondent No. 2 Bank for settlement of the amount due 
regarding the group loan accounts. To that effect, a One Time 
Settlement (“OTS” for short) dated 19th November 2015 of Rs. 
3.8 crores was offered to the respondent No. 2 Bank for 
settling all the dues. The same was accepted by the 
respondent No. 2 Bank. The OTS amount was paid, and the 
respondent No. 2 Bank issued a No Dues Certificate dated 
21st November 2015 to the borrowers/guarantors.   
3.8 When the matter stood thus, the Accused Nos. 1 to 5, 
including the present appellants, filed a Criminal Petition 
bearing No. 5778 of 2016 on 18th April 2016 before the High 
Court under Section 482 CrPC seeking quashing of the 
charge-sheet filed before the trial Court by the CBI. 

5 
3.9 During the pendency of the Criminal Petition before the High 
Court, the DRT vide order dated 4th May 2016, recorded that 
the matter has been settled as per the OTS and disposed of 
the OA as settled, in full satisfaction of the dues of the 
respondent No. 2 Bank. 
3.10 The High Court, however, vide the impugned final judgment 
and order dismissed the Criminal Petition filed by the 
Accused Nos. 1 to 5 holding that the settlement arrived at 
was only a private settlement and was not a part of any decree 
given by any court. The charges include the use of fraudulent, 
fake and forged documents that were used to embezzle public 
money and if these are proved, they would be grave crimes 
against the society as a whole and hence, merely due to a 
private settlement between the Bank and the accused, it 
cannot be said that the prosecution of the accused persons 
would amount to abuse of process of the court. 
3.11 Aggrieved thereby, two of the accused persons (Accused Nos. 
3 & 4) have filed the present appeal.  
 

6 
4. 
We have heard Shri Dama Seshadri Naidu, learned Senior 
Counsel for the appellants and Shri Vikramjeet Banerjee learned 
Additional Solicitor General (“ASG” for short) appearing for the 
CBI, Ms. Devina Sehgal, learned counsel for the respondent 
No.1-State and Mr. Himanshu Munshi, learned counsel for the 
respondent No.2-Bank.   
5. 
Shri Naidu submits that the appellants before this Court 
had no active role to play.  It is submitted that the Appellant No.1 
(Accused No.3) is the wife of Accused No.2 and Appellant No.2 
(Accused No.4) is the wife of Accused No.1. It is submitted that 
even from the perusal of the chargesheet it would reveal that no 
active role is attributed to the present appellants.   
6. 
Shri Naidu further submits that in the proceedings before 
the DRT, the matter has been amicably settled between the 
respondent No.2 Bank and the accused persons.  It is submitted 
that in addition to the total amount paid by the borrowers to the 
tune of Rs. 7,78,25,143/-, the Bank has also realized an amount 
of Rs. 1,07,54,000/- by auctioning the mortgaged properties.  
7. 
It is further submitted that during the pendency of OA 

7 
before the DRT, in view of OTS an amount of Rs. 3,80,00,000/- 
was also paid to the respondent No.2 Bank and as such, the 
respondent No.2 Bank has closed the loan account. The learned 
Senior Counsel, therefore, submits that the continuance of the 
proceedings against the appellants would be an exercise in 
futility.  
8. 
Shri Naidu in support of his submissions relied on the 
following judgments of this Court in the cases of: 
(i) 
Central Bureau of Investigation, SPE, SIU (X), New 
Delhi v. Duncans Agro Industries Ltd., Calcutta1; 
(ii) 
Nikhil Merchant v. Central Bureau of Investigation 
and another2; 
(iii) Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another3; 
(iv) 
Central Bureau of Investigation, ACB, Mumbai v. 
Narendra Lal Jain and others4; 
(v) 
Narinder Singh and others v. State of Punjab and 
another5; 
 
1 (1996) 5 SCC 591 
2 (2008) 9 SCC 677 
3 (2012) 10 SCC 303 
4 (2014) 5 SCC 364 
5 (2014) 6 SCC 466 

8 
(vi) 
Gold Quest International Private Limited v. State of 
Tamil Nadu and others6; and  
(vii) Central Bureau of Investigation v. Sadhu Ram 
Singla and others7. 
9. 
Mr. Himanshu Munshi, learned counsel for the respondent 
No.2 Bank confirms the fact regarding the settlement entered 
into between the Bank and the borrowers.  
10. Shri Vikramjeet Banerjee, learned ASG, appearing on behalf 
of the CBI, however, submits that merely because the matter is 
settled between the Bank and the borrowers, it does not absolve 
the accused persons of their criminal liability.  It is submitted 
that the learned judge of the High Court has rightly, upon 
consideration of the legal position, dismissed the petition under 
Section 482 of the CrPC.  The learned ASG, therefore, prays for 
dismissal of the present appeal.   
11. The facts in the present case are not in dispute.  It is not 
disputed that the matter has been compromised between the 
borrowers and the Bank.  It is also not in dispute that, upon 
 
6 (2014) 15 SCC 235 
7 (2017) 5 SCC 350 

9 
payment of the amount under the OTS, the loan account of the 
borrower has been closed.  
12. Therefore, the only question would be, as to whether the 
continuation of the criminal proceedings against the present 
appellants would be justified or not.   
13. At the outset, we may state that we are only considering the 
cases only of two women i.e. Accused Nos. 3 and 4, who are wives 
of original Accused Nos. 2 and 1 respectively.  
14. A perusal of the chargesheet would reveal that the specific 
role is attributed to Accused No.1-K. Suresh Kumar.  The 
allegations against the present appellants are that they were 
involved in criminal conspiracy with Accused No.1.   
15. We may gainfully refer to the following observations of this 
Court in the case of Duncans Agro Industries Ltd., Calcutta 
(supra): 
“26. After giving our careful consideration 
to the facts and circumstances of the case 
and 
the 
submissions 
made 
by 
the 
respective counsel for the parties, it 
appears to us that for the purpose of 
quashing the complaint, it is necessary to 
consider whether the allegations in the 
complaint prima facie make out an offence 

10 
or not. It is not necessary to scrutinise the 
allegations for the purpose of deciding 
whether such allegations are likely to be 
upheld in the trial. Any action by way of 
quashing the complaint is an action to be 
taken at the threshold before evidences are 
led in support of the complaint. For 
quashing the complaint by way of action at 
the threshold, it is, therefore, necessary to 
consider whether on the face of the 
allegations, 
a 
criminal 
offence 
is 
constituted or not. In recent decisions of 
this Court, in the case of Bhajan Lal [1992 
Supp (1) SCC 335 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 
426] , P.P. Sharma [1992 Supp (1) SCC 
222 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 192] and Janata 
Dal [(1992) 4 SCC 305 : 1993 SCC (Cri) 
36] , since relied on by Mr Tulsi, the 
guiding principles in quashing a criminal 
case have been indicated. 
 
27. ……………………………………………... 
 
28. ……………………………………………... 
 
29. In the facts of the case, it appears to 
us that there is enough justification for the 
High Court to hold that the case was 
basically a matter of civil dispute. The 
Banks had already filed suits for 
recovery of the dues of the Banks on 
account of credit facility and the said 
suits 
have 
been 
compromised 
on 
receiving 
the 
payments 
from 
the 
companies 
concerned. 
Even 
if 
an 
offence of cheating is prima facie 
constituted, 
such 
offence 
is 
a 
compoundable offence and compromise 

11 
decrees passed in the suits instituted 
by the Banks, for all intents and 
purposes, amount to compounding of 
the offence of cheating. It is also to be 
noted that a long time has elapsed since 
the complaint was filed in 1987. It may 
also be indicated that although such FIRs 
were filed in 1987 and 1989, the Banks 
have not chosen to institute any case 
against the alleged erring officials despite 
allegations made against them in the FIRs. 
Considering that the investigations had 
not been completed till 1991 even though 
there was no impediment to complete the 
investigations and further investigations 
are still pending and also considering the 
fact that the claims of the Banks have been 
satisfied and the suits instituted by the 
Banks 
have 
been 
compromised 
on 
receiving payments, we do not think that 
the said complaints should be pursued 
any further…………..” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
16. It could thus be seen that this Court in the case of Duncans 
Agro Industries Ltd found that the Banks had already filed 
suits for recovery of the dues of the Banks on account of credit 
facility and the said suits had been compromised on receiving 
the payments from the companies concerned. The Court found 
that even if an offence of cheating is prima facie constituted, such 
offence is a compoundable offence and compromise decrees 

12 
passed in the suits instituted by the Banks, for all intents and 
purposes, amounted to compounding of the offence of cheating.  
17. In the case of Nikhil Merchant (supra), this Court was 
considering a civil dispute with certain criminal facets.  The 
matter also involved offences which were not compoundable in 
nature.  This Court, therefore, considered the question as to 
whether the criminal proceedings could be quashed under Article 
142 of the Constitution of India on the basis of compromise, even 
where non-compoundable offences are involved.   
18. An argument was advanced on behalf of the Union that this 
Court should not exercise its powers under Article 142 of the 
Constitution of India in order to quash the proceedings for non-
compoundable offences. This Court observed thus: 
“25. It was urged that even if no steps have 
been taken by CBI since the charge-sheet 
was filed in 1998, the same would not be a 
ground 
for 
quashing 
the 
criminal 
proceedings once the charge-sheet had 
been filed. He submitted that in view of the 
decision of this Court in Supreme Court 
Bar Assn. v. Union of India [(1998) 4 SCC 
409] this Court would possibly not be 
justified in giving directions in the instant 
case even under Article 142 of the 
Constitution, 
since 
the 
Constitution 

13 
Bench had held that in exercise of its 
plenary powers under Article 142, this 
Court could not ignore any substantive 
statutory provision dealing with the 
subject. 
It 
is 
a 
residuary 
power, 
supplementary and complementary to the 
powers specifically conferred on the 
Supreme Court by statutes, exercisable to 
do complete justice between the parties 
where it is just and equitable to do so. It 
was further observed that the power under 
Article 142 of the Constitution was vested 
in the Supreme Court to prevent any 
obstruction to the stream of justice. 
 
26. The 
learned 
Additional 
Solicitor 
General submitted that the power under 
Article 142 is to be exercised sparingly and 
only in rare and exceptional cases and in 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
exceptional 
circumstances the appeal was liable to be 
dismissed. 
 
27. Having carefully considered the facts 
of the case and the submissions of learned 
counsel in regard thereto, we are of the 
view that, although, technically there is 
force in the submissions made by the 
learned Additional Solicitor General, the 
facts of the case warrant interference in 
these proceedings. 
 
28. The basic intention of the accused in 
this case appears to have been to 
misrepresent the financial status of the 
Company, M/s Neemuch Emballage Ltd., 
Mumbai, in order to avail of the credit 
facilities to an extent to which the 

14 
Company was not entitled. In other words, 
the main intention of the Company and its 
officers was to cheat the Bank and induce 
it to part with additional amounts of credit 
to which the Company was not otherwise 
entitled. 
 
29. Despite the ingredients and the factual 
content 
of 
an 
offence 
of 
cheating 
punishable under Section 420 IPC, the 
same has been made compoundable under 
sub-section (2) of Section 320 CrPC with 
the leave of the court. Of course, forgery 
has not been included as one of the 
compoundable offences, but it is in such 
cases that the principle enunciated in B.S. 
Joshi case [(2003) 4 SCC 675 : 2003 SCC 
(Cri) 848] becomes relevant. 
 
30. In the instant case, the disputes 
between the Company and the Bank have 
been set at rest on the basis of the 
compromise 
arrived 
at 
by 
them 
whereunder the dues of the Bank have 
been cleared and the Bank does not 
appear to have any further claim against 
the Company. What, however, remains is 
the fact that certain documents were 
alleged to have been created by the 
appellant herein in order to avail of credit 
facilities beyond the limit to which the 
Company 
was 
entitled. 
The 
dispute 
involved herein has overtones of a civil 
dispute with certain criminal facets. The 
question which is required to be answered 
in this case is whether the power which 
independently lies with this Court to 
quash the criminal proceedings pursuant 

15 
to the compromise arrived at, should at all 
be exercised? 
 
31. On an overall view of the facts as 
indicated hereinabove and keeping in 
mind the decision of this Court in B.S. 
Joshi case [(2003) 4 SCC 675 : 2003 SCC 
(Cri) 848] and the compromise arrived at 
between the Company and the Bank as 
also Clause 11 of the consent terms filed 
in the suit filed by the Bank, we are 
satisfied that this is a fit case where 
technicality should not be allowed to stand 
in the way in the quashing of the criminal 
proceedings, since, in our view, the 
continuance 
of 
the 
same 
after 
the 
compromise arrived at between the parties 
would be a futile exercise.” 
 
19. This Court found that though the offence punishable under 
Section 420 of the IPC was compoundable under sub-section (2) 
of Section 320 CrPC with the leave of the Court, the offence of 
forgery was not included as one of the compoundable offences.  
However, the Court found that in such cases the principle 
enunciated in the case of B.S. Joshi and others v. State of 
Haryana and another8 should be applied. 
20. This Court specifically noted that though it is alleged that 
 
8 (2003) 4 SCC 675 

16 
certain documents had been created by the appellant therein to 
avail of credit facilities beyond the limit to which the Company 
was entitled, the power of quashing could be exercised.  This 
Court found that in view of a compromise arrived at between the 
Company and the Bank, it was a fit case where a technicality 
should not be allowed to stand in the way of quashing of the 
criminal proceedings.  This Court found that in view of the 
settlement arrived at between the parties, continuance of the 
same would be an exercise in futility.   
21. A similar view was again taken by 2 Judge Bench of this 
Court in the case of Manoj Sharma v. State and others9.    
22. However, another 2 Judge Bench of this Court in the case 
of Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another10 doubted the 
correctness of the view taken by this Court in the cases of B.S. 
Joshi (supra), Nikhil Merchant (supra), and Manoj Sharma 
(supra) and referred the matter to a larger Bench.   
23. The reference was answered by the learned 3 Judge Bench 
 
9 (2008) 16 SCC 1 
10 (2010) 15 SCC 118 

17 
of this Court in the case of Gian Singh (supra)11.  Speaking for 
the Bench, R.M. Lodha, J. (as His Lordship then was), observed 
thus: 
“57. Quashing of offence or criminal 
proceedings on the ground of settlement 
between an offender and victim is not the 
same thing as compounding of offence. 
They 
are 
different 
and 
not 
interchangeable. Strictly speaking, the 
power of compounding of offences given to 
a court under Section 320 is materially 
different from the quashing of criminal 
proceedings by the High Court in exercise 
of 
its 
inherent 
jurisdiction. 
In 
compounding of offences, power of a 
criminal court is circumscribed by the 
provisions contained in Section 320 and 
the court is guided solely and squarely 
thereby while, on the other hand, the 
formation of opinion by the High Court for 
quashing a criminal offence or criminal 
proceeding or criminal complaint is guided 
by the material on record as to whether the 
ends of justice would justify such exercise 
of 
power 
although 
the 
ultimate 
consequence may be acquittal or dismissal 
of indictment. 
 
58. Where the High Court quashes a 
criminal proceeding having regard to the 
fact that the dispute between the offender 
and the victim has been settled although 
the offences are not compoundable, it does 
so as in its opinion, continuation of 
 
11 (2012) 10 SCC 303 

18 
criminal proceedings will be an exercise in 
futility and justice in the case demands 
that the dispute between the parties is put 
to an end and peace is restored; securing 
the ends of justice being the ultimate 
guiding factor. No doubt, crimes are acts 
which have harmful effect on the public 
and consist in wrongdoing that seriously 
endangers and threatens the well-being of 
the society and it is not safe to leave the 
crime-doer only because he and the victim 
have settled the dispute amicably or that 
the victim has been paid compensation, 
yet certain crimes have been made 
compoundable in law, with or without the 
permission of the court. In respect of 
serious 
offences 
like 
murder, 
rape, 
dacoity, etc., or other offences of mental 
depravity under IPC or offences of moral 
turpitude under special statutes, like the 
Prevention of Corruption Act or the 
offences committed by public servants 
while working in that capacity, the 
settlement between the offender and the 
victim can have no legal sanction at all. 
However, 
certain 
offences 
which 
overwhelmingly and predominantly bear 
civil flavour having arisen out of civil, 
mercantile, 
commercial, 
financial, 
partnership or such like transactions or 
the offences arising out of matrimony, 
particularly relating to dowry, etc. or the 
family dispute, where the wrong is 
basically to the victim and the offender and 
the victim have settled all disputes 
between them amicably, irrespective of the 
fact that such offences have not been 
made compoundable, the High Court may 

19 
within the framework of its inherent 
power, quash the criminal proceeding or 
criminal complaint or FIR if it is satisfied 
that on the face of such settlement, there 
is hardly any likelihood of the offender 
being convicted and by not quashing the 
criminal proceedings, justice shall be 
casualty and ends of justice shall be 
defeated. The above list is illustrative and 
not exhaustive. Each case will depend on 
its own facts and no hard-and-fast 
category can be prescribed. 
 
59.B.S. Joshi [(2003) 4 SCC 675 : 2003 
SCC (Cri) 848] , Nikhil Merchant [(2008) 9 
SCC 677 : (2008) 3 SCC (Cri) 858] , Manoj 
Sharma [(2008) 16 SCC 1 : (2010) 4 SCC 
(Cri) 145] and Shiji [(2011) 10 SCC 705 : 
(2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 101] do illustrate the 
principle that the High Court may quash 
criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint 
in exercise of its inherent power under 
Section 482 of the Code and Section 320 
does not limit or affect the powers of the 
High Court under Section 482. Can it be 
said 
that 
by 
quashing 
criminal 
proceedings in B.S. Joshi [(2003) 4 SCC 
675 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 848] , Nikhil 
Merchant [(2008) 9 SCC 677 : (2008) 3 SCC 
(Cri) 858] , Manoj Sharma [(2008) 16 SCC 
1 
: 
(2010) 
4 
SCC 
(Cri) 
145] 
and Shiji [(2011) 10 SCC 705 : (2012) 1 
SCC (Cri) 101] this Court has compounded 
the 
non-compoundable 
offences 
indirectly? We do not think so. There does 
exist 
the 
distinction 
between 
compounding of an offence under Section 
320 and quashing of a criminal case by the 

20 
High Court in exercise of inherent power 
under Section 482. The two powers are 
distinct 
and 
different 
although 
the 
ultimate consequence may be the same 
viz. acquittal of the accused or dismissal of 
indictment. 
 
60. We find no incongruity in the above 
principle of law and the decisions of this 
Court in Simrikhia [(1990) 2 SCC 437 : 
1990 SCC (Cri) 327] , Dharampal [(1993) 1 
SCC 435 : 1993 SCC (Cri) 333 : 1993 Cri 
LJ 1049] , Arun Shankar Shukla [(1999) 6 
SCC 146 : 1999 SCC (Cri) 1076 : AIR 1999 
SC 2554] , Ishwar Singh [(2008) 15 SCC 
667 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 1153] , Rumi 
Dhar [(2009) 6 SCC 364 : (2009) 2 SCC 
(Cri) 
1074] 
and Ashok 
Sadarangani [(2012) 11 SCC 321] . The 
principle propounded in Simrikhia [(1990) 
2 SCC 437 : 1990 SCC (Cri) 327] that the 
inherent jurisdiction of the High Court 
cannot be invoked to override express bar 
provided in law is by now well settled. 
In Dharampal [(1993) 1 SCC 435 : 1993 
SCC (Cri) 333 : 1993 Cri LJ 1049] the 
Court observed the same thing that the 
inherent powers under Section 482 of the 
Code cannot be utilised for exercising 
powers which are expressly barred by the 
Code. Similar statement of law is made 
in Arun Shankar Shukla [(1999) 6 SCC 
146 : 1999 SCC (Cri) 1076 : AIR 1999 SC 
2554] . In Ishwar Singh [(2008) 15 SCC 
667 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 1153] the accused 
was alleged to have committed an offence 
punishable under Section 307 IPC and 
with reference to Section 320 of the Code, 

21 
it was held that the offence punishable 
under 
Section 
307 
IPC 
was 
not 
compoundable offence and there was 
express bar in Section 320 that no offence 
shall 
be 
compounded 
if 
it 
is 
not 
compoundable under the Code. In Rumi 
Dhar [(2009) 6 SCC 364 : (2009) 2 SCC 
(Cri) 1074] although the accused had paid 
the entire due amount as per the 
settlement with the bank in the matter of 
recovery 
before 
the 
Debts 
Recovery 
Tribunal, 
the 
accused 
was 
being 
proceeded with for the commission of the 
offences 
under 
Sections 
120-
B/420/467/468/471 IPC along with the 
bank officers who were being prosecuted 
under Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(d) of 
the Prevention of Corruption Act. The 
Court refused to quash the charge against 
the accused by holding that the Court 
would not quash a case involving a crime 
against the society when a prima facie case 
has been made out against the accused for 
framing 
the 
charge. Ashok 
Sadarangani [(2012) 11 SCC 321] was 
again a case where the accused persons 
were charged of having committed the 
offences under Sections 120-B, 465, 467, 
468 and 471 IPC and the allegations were 
that the accused secured the credit 
facilities by submitting forged property 
documents as collaterals and utilised such 
facilities in a dishonest and fraudulent 
manner by opening letters of credit in 
respect of foreign supplies of goods, 
without actually bringing any goods but 
inducing the bank to negotiate the letters 
of credit in favour of foreign suppliers and 

22 
also by misusing the cash-credit facility. 
The Court was alive to the reference made 
in one of the present matters and also the 
decisions in B.S. Joshi [(2003) 4 SCC 675 : 
2003 
SCC 
(Cri) 
848] 
, Nikhil 
Merchant [(2008) 9 SCC 677 : (2008) 3 SCC 
(Cri) 858] and Manoj Sharma [(2008) 16 
SCC 1 : (2010) 4 SCC (Cri) 145] and it was 
held that B.S. Joshi [(2003) 4 SCC 675 : 
2003 
SCC 
(Cri) 
848] 
and Nikhil 
Merchant [(2008) 9 SCC 677 : (2008) 3 SCC 
(Cri) 858] dealt with different factual 
situation as the dispute involved had 
overtures of a civil dispute but the case 
under 
consideration 
in Ashok 
Sadarangani [(2012) 11 SCC 321] was 
more on the criminal intent than on a civil 
aspect. 
The 
decision 
in Ashok 
Sadarangani [(2012) 
11 
SCC 
321] 
supports the view that the criminal 
matters involving overtures of a civil 
dispute stand on a different footing. 
 
61. The position that emerges from the 
above discussion can be summarised 
thus : the power of the High Court in 
quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or 
complaint in exercise of its inherent 
jurisdiction is distinct and different from 
the power given to a criminal court for 
compounding the offences under Section 
320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide 
plenitude with no statutory limitation but 
it has to be exercised in accord with the 
guideline engrafted in such power viz. : (i) 
to secure the ends of justice, or (ii) to 
prevent abuse of the process of any court. 
In what cases power to quash the criminal 

23 
proceeding or complaint or FIR may be 
exercised where the offender and the 
victim have settled their dispute would 
depend on the facts and circumstances of 
each case and no category can be 
prescribed. However, before exercise of 
such power, the High Court must have due 
regard to the nature and gravity of the 
crime. Heinous and serious offences of 
mental depravity or offences like murder, 
rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly 
quashed even though the victim or victim's 
family and the offender have settled the 
dispute. Such offences are not private in 
nature and have a serious impact on 
society. 
Similarly, 
any 
compromise 
between the victim and the offender in 
relation to the offences under special 
statutes like the Prevention of Corruption 
Act or the offences committed by public 
servants while working in that capacity, 
etc.; cannot provide for any basis for 
quashing criminal proceedings involving 
such offences. But the criminal cases 
having 
overwhelmingly 
and 
predominatingly civil flavour stand on a 
different footing for the purposes of 
quashing, particularly the offences arising 
from commercial, financial, mercantile, 
civil, partnership or such like transactions 
or the offences arising out of matrimony 
relating to dowry, etc. or the family 
disputes where the wrong is basically 
private or personal in nature and the 
parties have resolved their entire dispute. 
In this category of cases, the High Court 
may quash the criminal proceedings if in 
its view, because of the compromise 

24 
between the offender and the victim, the 
possibility of conviction is remote and 
bleak and continuation of the criminal 
case would put the accused to great 
oppression and prejudice and extreme 
injustice would be caused to him by not 
quashing the criminal case despite full and 
complete settlement and compromise with 
the victim. In other words, the High Court 
must consider whether it would be unfair 
or contrary to the interest of justice to 
continue with the criminal proceeding or 
continuation of the criminal proceeding 
would tantamount to abuse of process of 
law despite settlement and compromise 
between the victim and the wrongdoer and 
whether to secure the ends of justice, it is 
appropriate that the criminal case is put to 
an end and if the answer to the above 
question(s) is in the affirmative, the High 
Court shall be well within its jurisdiction 
to quash the criminal proceeding.” 
 
24. It could thus be seen that the learned 3 Judge Bench of this 
Court held that B.S. Joshi, Nikhil Merchant, and Manoj 
Sharma were correctly decided. 
25. It has been held that there are certain offences which 
overwhelmingly and predominantly bear civil flavour having 
arisen out of civil, mercantile, commercial, financial, partnership 
or such like transactions or the offences arising out of 
matrimony, particularly relating to dowry, etc. or a family 

25 
dispute, where the wrong is basically to the victim and the 
offender and the victim have settled all disputes between them 
amicably, the High Court would be justified in quashing the 
criminal proceedings, even if the offences have not been made 
compoundable. 
26. In paragraph 60, His Lordship considers the cases where 
the Court has refused to quash the proceedings irrespective of 
the settlement.  The Court considers the different factual 
positions arising in the cases of B.S. Joshi, Nikhil Merchant, 
and Manoj Sharma on one hand and the other cases where the 
Court refused to quash the proceedings.  
27. In the cases of the first type, this Court found that the 
dispute involved had overtures of a civil dispute but in the other 
line of cases, the disputes were more on the criminal aspect than 
on a civil aspect.   
28. In paragraph 61, this Court observes that, in which cases 
power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may 
be exercised, where the offender and the victim have settled their 
dispute, would depend on the facts and circumstances of each 

26 
case.  However, the Court reiterates that the criminal cases 
having an overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour 
stand on a different footing for the purposes of quashing.  The 
Court particularly refers to the offences arising out of 
commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like 
transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to 
dowry, etc. or family disputes where the wrong is basically 
private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their 
entire dispute.  The Court finds that in such cases, the possibility 
of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of the 
criminal case would put the accused to great oppression and 
prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not 
quashing the criminal case despite full and complete settlement 
and compromise with the victim. 
29. Another 3 Judge Bench of this Court in the case of 
Narendra Lal Jain and others (supra), following Gian Singh12 
(supra) observed thus: 
“13. In the present case, as already seen, 
the offence with which the respondent-
accused had been charged are under 
 
12 Larger Bench decision 

27 
Sections 120-B/420 of the Penal Code. 
The civil liability of the respondents to pay 
the amount to the Bank has already been 
settled amicably. The terms of such 
settlement have been extracted above 
(see para 3). No subsisting grievance of the 
Bank in this regard has been brought to 
the notice of the Court. While the offence 
under Section 420 IPC is compoundable 
the offence under Section 120-B IPC is not. 
To the latter offence the ratio laid down 
in B.S. 
Joshi [B.S. 
Joshi v. State 
of 
Haryana, (2003) 4 SCC 675 : 2003 SCC 
(Cri) 848 : AIR 2003 SC 1386] and Nikhil 
Merchant [(2008) 9 SCC 677 : (2008) 3 SCC 
(Cri) 858] would apply if the facts of the 
given 
case 
would 
so 
justify. 
The 
observation 
in Gian 
Singh [Gian 
Singh v. State of Punjab, (2012) 10 SCC 
303 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 1188 : (2013) 1 
SCC (Cri) 160 : (2012) 2 SCC (L&S) 988] 
(para 61) will not be attracted in the 
present case in view of the offences alleged 
i.e. under Sections 420/120-B IPC. 
 
14. In the present case, having regard to 
the fact that the liability to make good the 
monetary loss suffered by the Bank had 
been mutually settled between the parties 
and the accused had accepted the liability 
in this regard, the High Court had thought 
it fit to invoke its power under Section 482 
CrPC. We do not see how such exercise of 
power can be faulted or held to be 
erroneous. Section 482 of the Code inheres 
in the High Court the power to make such 
order as may be considered necessary to, 
inter alia, prevent the abuse of the process 

28 
of law or to serve the ends of justice. While 
it will be wholly unnecessary to revert or 
refer to the settled position in law with 
regard to the contours of the power 
available under Section 482 CrPC it must 
be remembered that continuance of a 
criminal proceeding which is likely to 
become oppressive or may partake the 
character of a lame prosecution would be 
good ground to invoke the extraordinary 
power under Section 482 CrPC.” 
 
30. Subsequently, a 2 Judge Bench of this Court in the case of 
Narinder Singh and others (supra), after considering the 
earlier pronouncements of this Court, culled out the position 
thus:  
“29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we 
sum up and lay down the following 
principles by which the High Court would 
be guided in giving adequate treatment to 
the settlement between the parties and 
exercising its power under Section 482 of 
the Code while accepting the settlement 
and quashing the proceedings or refusing 
to accept the settlement with direction to 
continue with the criminal proceedings: 
 
29.1. Power conferred under Section 482 
of the Code is to be distinguished from the 
power which lies in the Court to compound 
the offences under Section 320 of the 
Code. No doubt, under Section 482 of the 
Code, the High Court has inherent power 
to quash the criminal proceedings even in 

29 
those cases which are not compoundable, 
where the parties have settled the matter 
between themselves. However, this power 
is to be exercised sparingly and with 
caution. 
 
29.2. When the parties have reached the 
settlement and on that basis petition for 
quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, 
the guiding factor in such cases would be 
to secure: 
(i) ends of justice, or 
(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of 
any court. 
While exercising the power the High Court 
is to form an opinion on either of the 
aforesaid two objectives. 
 
29.3. Such a power is not to be exercised 
in those prosecutions which involve 
heinous and serious offences of mental 
depravity or offences like murder, rape, 
dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private 
in nature and have a serious impact on 
society. Similarly, for the offences alleged 
to have been committed under special 
statute like the Prevention of Corruption 
Act or the offences committed by public 
servants while working in that capacity are 
not to be quashed merely on the basis of 
compromise between the victim and the 
offender. 
 
29.4. On the other hand, those criminal 
cases 
having 
overwhelmingly 
and 
predominantly civil character, particularly 
those 
arising 
out 
of 
commercial 
transactions or arising out of matrimonial 

30 
relationship or family disputes should be 
quashed when the parties have resolved 
their entire disputes among themselves. 
 
29.5. While exercising its powers, the High 
Court is to examine as to whether the 
possibility of conviction is remote and 
bleak and continuation of criminal cases 
would put the accused to great oppression 
and prejudice and extreme injustice would 
be caused to him by not quashing the 
criminal cases. 
 
29.6. Offences under Section 307 IPC 
would fall in the category of heinous and 
serious offences and therefore are to be 
generally treated as crime against the 
society and not against the individual 
alone. However, the High Court would not 
rest its decision merely because there is a 
mention of Section 307 IPC in the FIR or 
the charge is framed under this provision. 
It would be open to the High Court to 
examine as to whether incorporation of 
Section 307 IPC is there for the sake of it 
or the prosecution has collected sufficient 
evidence, which if proved, would lead to 
proving the charge under Section 307 IPC. 
For this purpose, it would be open to the 
High Court to go by the nature of injury 
sustained, whether such injury is inflicted 
on the vital/delicate parts of the body, 
nature of weapons used, etc. Medical 
report in respect of injuries suffered by the 
victim can generally be the guiding factor. 
On the basis of this prima facie analysis, 
the High Court can examine as to whether 
there is a strong possibility of conviction or 

31 
the chances of conviction are remote and 
bleak. In the former case it can refuse to 
accept the settlement and quash the 
criminal proceedings whereas in the latter 
case it would be permissible for the High 
Court to accept the plea compounding the 
offence based on complete settlement 
between the parties. At this stage, the 
Court can also be swayed by the fact that 
the settlement between the parties is going 
to result in harmony between them which 
may improve their future relationship. 
 
29.7. While deciding whether to exercise 
its power under Section 482 of the Code or 
not, timings of settlement play a crucial 
role. Those cases where the settlement is 
arrived at immediately after the alleged 
commission of offence and the matter is 
still under investigation, the High Court 
may be liberal in accepting the settlement 
to 
quash 
the 
criminal 
proceedings/investigation. It is because of 
the 
reason 
that 
at 
this 
stage 
the 
investigation is still on and even the 
charge-sheet has not been filed. Likewise, 
those cases where the charge is framed but 
the evidence is yet to start or the evidence 
is still at infancy stage, the High Court can 
show benevolence in exercising its powers 
favourably, 
but 
after 
prima 
facie 
assessment of the circumstances/material 
mentioned above. On the other hand, 
where the prosecution evidence is almost 
complete or after the conclusion of the 
evidence the matter is at the stage of 
argument, normally the High Court should 
refrain from exercising its power under 

32 
Section 482 of the Code, as in such cases 
the trial court would be in a position to 
decide the case finally on merits and to 
come to a conclusion as to whether the 
offence 
under 
Section 
307 
IPC 
is 
committed or not. Similarly, in those cases 
where the conviction is already recorded 
by the trial court and the matter is at the 
appellate stage before the High Court, 
mere compromise between the parties 
would not be a ground to accept the same 
resulting in acquittal of the offender who 
has already been convicted by the trial 
court. Here charge is proved under Section 
307 IPC and conviction is already recorded 
of a heinous crime and, therefore, there is 
no question of sparing a convict found 
guilty of such a crime.” 
 
31. It could thus be seen that this Court reiterates the position 
that 
the 
criminal 
cases 
having 
overwhelmingly 
and 
predominantly civil character, particularly those arising out of 
commercial 
transactions 
or 
arising 
out 
of 
matrimonial 
relationship or family disputes should be quashed when the 
parties have resolved their entire disputes among themselves.   
32. Though in the said case, the High Court had refused to 
exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC to quash the 
proceedings wherein a serious offence under Section 307 IPC was 
involved, this Court after taking into consideration various 

33 
factors including that the elders of the village, including the 
Sarpanch, had intervened in the matter and the parties had not 
only buried their hatchet but had decided to live peacefully in the 
future, quashed and set aside the criminal proceedings under 
Section 307 IPC.   
33. The aforesaid view has consistently been followed by this 
Court in various cases including Gold Quest International 
Private Limited (supra) and Sadhu Ram Singla and others 
(supra). 
34. The facts in the present case are similar to the facts in the 
case of Sadhu Ram Singla and others (supra) wherein a 
dispute between the borrower and the Bank was settled.  In the 
present case also, undisputedly, the FIR and the chargesheet are 
pertaining to the dispute concerning the loan transaction availed 
by the accused persons on one hand and the Bank on the other 
hand.  Admittedly, the Bank and the accused persons have 
settled the matter.  Apart from the earlier payment received by 
the Bank either through Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs) or 
sale of the mortgaged properties, the borrowers have paid an 

34 
amount of Rs.3,80,00,000/- under OTS.  After receipt of the 
amount under OTS, the Bank had also decided to close the loan 
account. The dispute involved predominantly had overtures of a 
civil dispute. 
35. Apart from that, it is further to be noted that in view of the 
settlement between the parties in the proceedings before the 
DRT, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak.  In our 
view, continuation of the criminal proceedings would put the 
accused to great oppression and prejudice.   
36. In any case, as discussed hereinabove, both the appellants 
have been arraigned as wives of the Accused Nos. 1 and 2.  The 
specific role that was attributed in the chargesheet was 
pertaining to Accused No.1.   
37. In the result, we find that this was a fit case wherein the 
High Court ought to have exercised its jurisdiction under Section 
482 CrPC and quash the criminal proceedings.   
38. We are therefore inclined to allow the present appeal. 
39. We accordingly pass the following order: 
(i) 
The appeal is allowed. 

35 
(ii) 
The impugned judgment and order dated 1st 
September 2017 passed by the High Court of 
Judicature at Hyderabad for the State of Telangana 
and the State of Andhra Pradesh in Criminal Petition 
No. 5778 of 2016 is quashed and aside. 
(iii) The criminal proceedings against the appellants in 
C.C. No. 16 of 2014 on the file of Principal Special 
Judge for CBI Cases, Nampally, Hyderabad is also 
quashed and set aside.  
40. For the reasons stated in I.A. No. 68579 of 2021 for 
discharge of AOR, the same is allowed.
