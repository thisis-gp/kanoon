the High Court dated 5th January 2022 in Contempt 
Application (Civil) No. 2609 of 2015 preferred by respondent 
No.1, itself was not tenable. It is submitted that by the said 
order, the learned Single Judge had held that the appellants 
have not committed contempt of the order of the learned 
Single Judge passed on 22nd April 2015, and therefore in 
view of the decision of this Court in the case of Midnapore 
Peoples’ Coop. Bank Ltd. and Others v. Chunilal Nanda 
and Others1, the appeal was not tenable. 
4. 
Per contra, Shri Sanjeev Kumar Singh, learned counsel 
appearing 
for 
contesting 
respondent/Respondent 
No.1, 
submits that the learned Single Judge of the High Court 
while deciding the contempt application has gone into the 
merits of the matter and therefore in view of paragraph 11, 
clause V of the judgment in Midnapore Peoples’ Coop. 
Bank Ltd. and Others (supra), the appeal was very much 
tenable. 
5. 
This Court in the case of Midnapore Peoples’ Coop. 
Bank Ltd. and Others (supra) has observed thus:- 
“11. The position emerging from these decisions, in 
regard to appeals against orders in contempt 
 
1 (2006) 5 SCC 399 : 2006 INSC 367 

3 
proceedings may be summarized thus : 
I. 
An 
appeal 
under 
section 
19 
is 
maintainable only against an order or 
decision of the High Court passed in 
exercise of its jurisdiction to punish for 
contempt, that is, an order imposing 
punishment for contempt. 
II. Neither an order declining to initiate 
proceedings for contempt, nor an order 
initiating proceedings for contempt nor an 
order 
dropping 
the 
proceedings 
for 
contempt nor an order acquitting or 
exonerating the contemnor, is appealable 
under Section 19 of the CC Act. In special 
circumstances, they may be open to 
challenge 
under 
Article 
136 
of 
the 
Constitution. 
III. In a proceeding for contempt, the High 
Court can decide whether any contempt 
of court has been committed, and if so, 
what should be the punishment and 
matters incidental thereto. In such a 
proceeding, it is not appropriate to 
adjudicate or decide any issue relating to 
the merits of the dispute between the 
parties. 
IV. Any direction issued or decision made 
by the High Court on the merits of a 
dispute between the parties, will not be in 
the exercise of 'jurisdiction to punish for 
contempt' and therefore, not appealable 
under section 19 of CC Act. The only 
exception is where such direction or 
decision is incidental to or inextricably 
connected with the order punishing for 
contempt, in which event the appeal 
under section 19 of the Act, can also 
encompass the incidental or inextricably 
connected directions. 
V. If the High Court, for whatsoever 

4 
reason, decides an issue or makes any 
direction, relating to the merits of the 
dispute 
between 
the 
parties, 
in 
a 
contempt 
proceedings, 
the 
aggrieved 
person is not without remedy. Such an 
order is open to challenge in an intra-
court appeal (if the order was of a learned 
Single Judge and there is a provision for 
an intra-court appeal), or by seeking 
special leave to appeal under Article 136 
of the Constitution of India (in other 
cases).” 
 
 
6. 
From the perusal of the order passed by the learned 
Single Judge it is clear to us that by the said order the 
learned Single Judge had in unequivocal terms held that no 
case for contempt was made out of the judgment and order 
dated 22nd April 2015 and as such dismissed the said 
contempt application preferred by respondent No.1.  As such, 
in view of clause II of paragraph 11 of the judgment of this 
Court in Midnapore Peoples’ Coop. Bank Ltd. and Others 
(supra), the appeal itself was not tenable. 
7. 
The reliance placed by the learned counsel for the 
respondent No.1/employee on Clause V, in our view, is not 
well pressed. There is no adjudication or direction with 
regard to the merits of the matter by the learned Single 
Judge in the order dated 5th January 2022.  In any case, in 

5 
view of a specific bar, the remedy available to Respondent 
No.1, if any, was to challenge the order of the learned Single 
Judge by way of special leave petition. 
8. 
On this short ground, we are inclined to allow the 
appeal. The impugned order is quashed and set aside and 
the appeal filed by the respondent No.1/employee before the 
Division Bench of the High Court stands dismissed.  Ordered 
accordingly. 
9. 
In the event Respondent No.1 files special leave petition 
before this Court challenging the order of the learned Single 
Judge dated 5th January 2022, she would be entitled to 
benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 for the 
period during which the proceedings were pending before the 
Division Bench of the High Court and before this Court. 
10. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
