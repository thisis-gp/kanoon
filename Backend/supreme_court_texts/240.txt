Brief facts are that an FIR No.733 of 20224 was registered on the 
complaint of the appellant-complainant alleging murder of his son. 
During investigation involvement of respondent no.2 was found. He was 
taken into custody on 15.06.2022. The bail application5 filed by him was 
dismissed by the Sessions Judge6 on 23.09.2022, while recording the 
reasons in detail. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, bail application was 
filed by the respondent no.2 before the High Court.  The same was 
allowed on 03.08.2023, directing release of the respondent no.2 on bail. 
It is the aforesaid order which is impugned before this Court. 
4.  
 
Learned counsel for the appellant-complainant submitted that 
while directing release of the respondent no.2 on bail, the High Court has 
failed to consider the relevant facts, which clearly led to his involvement 
in the crime. Merely, after briefly noticing the stand taken by the parties, 
the bail application was allowed by the High Court. The same is totally in 
contravention of the law laid down by this Court in terms of which reasons, 
in brief, are required to the given.

5.  
 
Learned counsel for the respondent No. 1-State supported the 
stand taken by the learned counsel for the appellant. Though, the order 
of the High Court has not been challenged by the State as such. 
6.  
 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent no.2 
submitted that it is a case in which the respondent no.2 is not named in 
the FIR.  He had already suffered incarceration for approximately one 
year and two months. The High Court, after considering relevant 
materials and keeping in view the fact that any detailed finding would 
have prejudiced the case of other side, directed the release of the 
respondent no.2 on bail. There is nothing pointed out regarding the 
conduct of the respondent no.2 after he was released on bail.  It should 
be considered as a relevant factor at this stage in the present appeal 
seeking cancellation of the bail, granted to the respondent no.2. 
7.  
 
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused 
the paper book. 
8. 
 
The respondent no.2 in the case in hand is involved in heinous 
crime where murder of the son of the appellant-complainant had taken 
place. Respondent no.2 was not named in the FIR. However, when the 
matter was investigated in detail, the police could gather evidence 
pointing out involvement of the respondent no.2 in crime. The material 

Page 4 of 4 
 
collected was discussed in detail by the Sessions Judge while rejecting 
the bail application of the respondent no.2. However, the High Court 
merely noticing the arguments raised primarily by the counsel for the 
respondent no.2 has directed for his release on bail, which in our opinion 
cannot be legally sustained. 
9.  
 
For the reasons mentioned above, the appeal is allowed. The 
impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside. The respondent 
no.2 is granted three weeks' time to surrender.  We make it clear that 
nothing in the above said order shall prejudice the respondent no.2 in any 
subsequent proceedings relating to the crime.  The above order shall not 
debar the respondent no.2 from filing a fresh bail application at any 
subsequent stage, which shall be considered by the court concerned on 
its own merits.
