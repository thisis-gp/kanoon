referred to as the defendant, and the respondent 
as the plaintiff. 
4. The factual matrix leading to the present appeal 
is as follows: 
4.1 The dispute centers around a piece of 
agricultural land measuring 2 acres, 
bearing Khasra No. 202/7, situated in 
Patwari Halka No. 10, Manendragarh, 
near 
Hansiya 
River, 
Ward 
No. 
1 
(hereinafter referred to as "the suit land"). 
The plaintiff is the undisputed owner of 
this land. 
4.2 In 1990, the plaintiff, in need of funds, 
approached the defendant and mortgaged 
the suit land for a sum of ₹75,000. A 
mortgage 
deed 
was 
executed 
and 
registered on 17.10.1990.  
4.3 The plaintiff contends that it was orally 
agreed 
that 
she 
could 
redeem 
the 
mortgage within three years by repaying a 
total sum of ₹1,20,000, which included the 
principal amount, interest, and expenses. 
She remained in possession of the suit 
land throughout this period. 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019

4.4 In 1993, the plaintiff attempted to redeem 
the mortgage by offering ₹1,20,000 to the 
defendant. 
However, 
the 
defendant 
refused to accept the payment, asserting 
that, according to the terms of the 
mortgage 
deed, 
the 
mortgage 
had 
transformed into an absolute sale due to 
the plaintiff's failure to repay the amount 
within the stipulated time. 
4.5 Aggrieved by the defendant's refusal, the 
plaintiff filed Civil Suit No. 26-A/2001 
before the Court of Additional District 
Judge, 
Manendragarh, 
seeking 
redemption 
of 
the 
mortgage 
and 
a 
declaration that the defendant's claim of 
ownership was invalid. 
4.6 The 
defendant 
contested 
the 
suit, 
asserting 
that 
the 
mortgage 
deed 
contained a condition converting it into a 
sale deed upon default and that the 
plaintiff had failed to repay the amount 
within 
three 
years. 
The 
defendant 
maintained that she had become the 
rightful owner of the suit land.

4.7 After considering the evidence and hearing 
both parties, the Trial Court decreed the 
suit in favor of the plaintiff on 14.11.2003. 
The 
court 
held 
that 
the 
condition 
converting the mortgage into a sale was a 
clog on the equity of redemption and 
allowed the plaintiff to redeem the 
mortgage by paying ₹1,20,000 to the 
defendant. 
This 
amount 
has 
been 
deposited by the plaintiff with the Trial 
Court and is lying in deposit as such. 
4.8 Aggrieved by the Trial Court's judgment, 
the defendant filed First Appeal No. 28 of 
2004 
before 
the 
High 
Court 
of 
Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur. The High Court, 
by 
its 
judgment 
dated 
06.09.2018, 
dismissed the appeal and affirmed the 
Trial Court's decision. 
4.9 The defendant subsequently filed Review 
Petition No. 222 of 2018 before the High 
Court, challenging the dismissal of her 
appeal. The High Court dismissed the 
review petition on 30.01.2019. 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019

5. Being aggrieved with the judgments of the High 
Court in both the appeal and the review petition, 
the defendant has preferred the present appeal 
before this Court. 
Arguments for the Defendant (Appellant) 
6. Learned counsel for the defendant contends that 
the courts below erred in holding that the 
mortgage deed dated 17.10.1990 was a simple 
mortgage under Section 58(b) of the Transfer of 
Property Act, 18821. It is submitted that the 
mortgage deed was, in fact, a mortgage by 
conditional sale as per Section 58(c) of the Act, 
containing a clear stipulation that if the plaintiff 
failed to repay the mortgage amount along with 
interest within three years, the mortgage would 
automatically convert into an absolute sale in 
favour of the defendant. 
7. It is further argued that the plaintiff failed to 
tender the amount within the agreed period of 
three years, and therefore, the defendant lawfully 
became the owner of the suit land. It is 
emphasized that the terms of the registered 
 
1 In short, ‘the Act’ 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
6 
 
mortgage deed were fully explained to the 
plaintiff, and there is no credible evidence to 
suggest otherwise. Furthermore, it is submitted 
that the plaintiff did not personally appear in the 
witness box to substantiate her claims. Instead, 
her husband, acting as her power of attorney 
holder, deposed on her behalf.  
8. The learned counsel also contends that Section 
165 of the Chhattisgarh Land Revenue Code, 
19592, does not apply to the present case. It is 
argued that the suit land is not agricultural land, 
as residential structures have been constructed 
on it, and therefore, the restrictions under 
Section 165 of the Code are inapplicable. 
9. Lastly, it is submitted that the plaintiff failed to 
seek the consequential relief of possession in her 
suit. As per Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 
1963, a suit for declaration without seeking 
consequential relief is not maintainable, and 
thus, the suit ought to have been dismissed on 
this ground alone. 
 
 
2 In short, ‘the Code’ 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019

Arguments for the Plaintiff (Respondent) 
10. Opposing the appeal, learned counsel for the 
plaintiff supports the concurrent findings of the 
Trial Court and the High Court. It is argued that 
the mortgage was a simple mortgage, and the 
condition purporting to convert it into an 
absolute sale upon default is a clog on the equity 
of redemption and is void. It is argued that the 
plaintiff remained in possession of the suit land 
throughout, cultivating it continuously, which 
indicates that the transaction was not a 
mortgage by conditional sale. The exorbitant 
interest rate of 4% per month is unconscionable 
and supports the plaintiff's contention that the 
terms were oppressive. 
11. It is further argued that the plaintiff's husband, 
who deposed on her behalf, had personal 
knowledge of the transaction and was competent 
to testify. The evidence provided by him is 
credible and sufficient to support the plaintiff's 
case.  
12. Regarding Section 165 of the Code, it is 
contended that the provision applies, rendering 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
8 
 
the mortgage invalid since the plaintiff was left 
with less than 10 acres of un-irrigated land after 
the mortgage. 
Analysis  
13. The central issue for determination is whether 
the mortgage deed dated 17.10.1990 constitutes 
a mortgage by conditional sale under Section 
58(c) of the Act, and whether the plaintiff is 
entitled to redeem the mortgage. To address this 
issue, it is pertinent to examine the provisions of 
Section 58(c) of the Act, which has been 
reproduced hereunder:  
“Section 58(c): 
Mortgage by conditional sale-  
Where, the mortgagor ostensibly sells the 
mortgaged property— 
on condition that on default of payment of 
the mortgage-money on a certain date the 
sale shall become absolute, or 
on condition that on such payment being 
made the sale shall become void, or 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
9 
 
on condition that on such payment being 
made the buyer shall transfer the property 
to the seller, 
the transaction is called mortgage by 
conditional sale and the mortgagee a 
mortgagee by conditional sale: 
Provided that no such transaction shall be 
deemed to be a mortgage, unless the 
condition is embodied in the document 
which effects or purports to affect the sale.” 
 
14. On a bare reading of this provision, it can be 
deduced that the ingredients of a mortgage by 
conditional sale under Section 58(c) of the Act are 
as follows: 
(i) The mortgagor ostensibly sells the mortgaged 
property to the mortgagee. 
(ii) Such ostensible sale is subject to any one of 
the following conditions: 
• On default of payment of the mortgage-
money on a certain date, the sale shall 
become absolute; or 
• On payment of the mortgage-money on a 
certain date, the sale shall become void; or 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
10 
 
• On payment of the mortgage-money on a 
certain date, the buyer shall retransfer the 
property to the seller. 
(iii) The condition should be embodied in the 
same document which effects or purports to 
effect the sale. 
We shall now examine whether these ingredients 
are satisfied in the present case by analyzing the 
terms of the mortgage deed dated 17.10.1990. 
15. (i) Ostensible Sale of the Property 
The mortgage deed indicates that the mortgagor 
agreed to mortgage her land to the mortgagee for a 
sum of ₹75,000 due to personal financial needs. 
Clause 1 of the mortgage deed is reproduced 
hereunder: 
"1. That the mortgagor is the owner of the 
above land. The above land is mortgaged 
for a sum of Rs. 75,000 (seventy-five 
thousand). 
From 
today 
onwards 
possession of the above land will remain 
with 
the 
mortgagee 
with 
conditions 
purchaser. The above land prior to this has 
neither been mortgaged nor sold to 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
11 
 
anybody else. Mortgagee with condition 
purchaser can use this land from today 
onwards. Entire money is received in 
cash." 
The use of the term "mortgage with condition to 
sell" and references to the mortgagee as 
"mortgagee with condition purchaser" indicate 
that the mortgagor ostensibly sold the property to 
the mortgagee, satisfying the first ingredient. 
16. (ii) Condition Attached to the Ostensible Sale 
The mortgage deed contains explicit conditions 
further in clause 1 that align with this condition: 
"1…….. 
The above land has been mortgaged for a 
period of three years. If the mortgagor 
returns the above money along with 
interest 
within 
three 
years 
to 
the 
mortgagee, then the mortgagee and her 
legal heirs will return back the possession 
of the mortgaged land to the mortgagor." 
"If the mortgagor fails to return back the 
said money within a period of three years 
from the date of execution of this 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
12 
 
document, then the present mortgage deed 
will be treated as sale deed. Then the 
mortgagor and her legal heirs will have no 
right to claim their possession over the 
said land from the mortgagee. That after 
the expiry of the said period of mortgage, 
the mortgagee will herself become the 
owner of said land and the right of 
mortgagor to get release her land will 
automatically close." 
This establishes that upon default in payment 
within the stipulated period, the sale would 
become absolute, satisfying the second ingredient 
under the first condition specified in Section 58(c) 
of the Act that on default of payment on a certain 
date, the sale shall become absolute. 
17. (iii) 
Condition 
Embodied 
in 
the 
Same 
Document 
As required under the proviso of Section 58(c), the 
condition regarding the conversion of the mortgage 
into an absolute sale upon default is embodied 
within the same document i.e., the mortgage deed 
dated 17.10.1990. This is evident from the clauses 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
13 
 
cited above and further reinforced by Clause 6 and 
7 of the mortgage deed as follows: 
"6. That the right of foreclosure of 
mortgagor will automatically close after 3 
years of registration of this document and 
will have no right of getting released this 
land and shall be debarred from the 
proceedings of releasing the said land." 
“7. That the expenses towards execution of 
this document will be borne by the 
mortgagor and after completion of the said 
period if the mortgagor with condition 
seller fails to repay the principal amount 
along with interest then this document will 
be treated as Sale Deed and the mortgagor 
with condition seller will have the right to 
demand the money towards expenses of 
this document from the mortgagee but the 
mortgagor will have no right to: claim 
interest on this amount.” 
The inclusion of the condition within the same 
document satisfies the third essential ingredient 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
14 
 
as mandated by the proviso to Section 58(c) of the 
Act. 
 
18. Therefore, it can be concluded that all the 
essential ingredients of a mortgage by conditional 
sale under Section 58(c) of the Act are satisfied 
in the present case as there was an ostensible 
sale of the property by the mortgagor to the 
mortgagee 
and 
the 
sale 
was 
conditional, 
stipulating that upon default of payment within 
three years, the sale would become absolute as 
well as that the condition was embodied in the 
same document, i.e. the mortgage deed, that 
effected the transaction.  
19. At this juncture, we must address that the Trial 
Court and the High Court placed significant 
emphasis on the fact that the plaintiff remained 
in possession of the suit land after the execution 
of the mortgage deed. They inferred that since 
possession was not delivered to the defendant, 
the transaction could not be a mortgage by 
conditional sale but was instead a simple 
mortgage. However, this conclusion overlooks 
critical aspects of the evidence and the nature of 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
15 
 
the possession in the present case. It is an 
admitted position by both parties that the 
plaintiff (mortgagor) remained in possession of 
the suit land after the execution of the mortgage 
deed. Importantly however, the nature of this 
possession was permissive and for the purpose of 
safeguarding the property. This is also evident 
from the testimony of the defendant-DW1, Vijay 
Kumar Khedia, who stated in his deposition: 
"After the documentation, Sarkar gave the 
possession of the land to my sister. Later 
on, Sarkar said that they will guard the 
land, so they will be allowed to live there." 
Here, "Sarkar" refers to the plaintiff and 
her husband, and "my sister" refers to the 
defendant. 
20. The permissive possession granted by the 
defendant to the plaintiff was a practical 
arrangement, given that the plaintiff was already 
residing on the land. This arrangement does not 
confer any additional rights upon the plaintiff 
beyond those specified in the mortgage deed. The 
Trial Court and the High Court erred in 
concluding that the continuous possession of the 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
16 
 
plaintiff negated the possibility of the transaction 
being a mortgage by conditional sale. The key 
factors that need to be considered are: 
• Nature of Possession: The possession was 
permissive and at the discretion of the 
defendant. It was not an indication of 
ownership or an absolute right but was 
granted to safeguard the property. 
• Intention of the Parties: The intention, as 
explicitly stated in the mortgage deed and 
corroborated by DW1's testimony, was that 
the property would become the absolute 
property of the defendant upon default of 
payment within the stipulated period. 
• Terms of the Mortgage Deed: The mortgage 
deed allowed the defendant to use the land 
and specified that the right of the mortgagor 
to 
reclaim 
the 
property 
would 
be 
extinguished upon default. 
21. The permissive possession by the plaintiff in the 
present case does not alter the character of the 
transaction. Allowing the plaintiff to remain on 
the land was a matter of convenience and does 
not affect the rights and obligations established 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
17 
 
by the mortgage deed. It is also pertinent to note 
that permitting the plaintiff to enjoy both the 
possession of the property and the benefit of the 
₹75,000 received from the defendant, without 
fulfilling her obligations under the mortgage 
agreement, would result in unjust enrichment at 
the expense of the defendant. Therefore, the 
courts below erred in relying heavily on the 
aspect of possession to conclude that the 
transaction was a simple mortgage. 
22. It should also be noted that the plaintiff failed to 
repay the mortgage amount along with the 
agreed interest within the stipulated period of 
three years. There is no credible evidence to 
suggest that she attempted to tender the amount 
within the time frame. Her assertion that the 
defendant refused to accept repayment is 
unsubstantiated. 
23. It is to be also considered that the plaintiff did 
not enter the witness box to testify regarding her 
claims, including her understanding of the 
mortgage deed and the alleged refusal by the 
defendant to accept repayment. Her husband, 
acting as her power of attorney holder, deposed 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
18 
 
on her behalf. However, matters within the 
personal knowledge of the plaintiff could not be 
adequately addressed by her husband. 
24. The plaintiff also contends that the mortgage is 
invalid under Section 165(2) of the Code, which 
restricts the transfer of agricultural land by a 
Bhumiswami 
if 
less 
than 
10 
acres 
of 
unencumbered un-irrigated land would remain 
with the transferor. However, the defendant 
asserts that the suit land is not agricultural land, 
as residential structures have been constructed 
on it. This is supported by the testimony of DW-
1. The plaintiff failed to provide concrete 
evidence, such as revenue records or land use 
certificates, to establish the agricultural nature 
of the land or to demonstrate that she was left 
with less than 10 acres of unencumbered un-
irrigated land after the transaction. 
25. In the absence of clear evidence, the applicability 
of Section 165 of the 1959 Code cannot be 
presumed. Moreover, even if the provision were 
applicable, it would render the transaction 
voidable at the instance of the State or the 
affected party. Neither the State has challenged 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
19 
 
the transaction, nor did the plaintiff seek to have 
the mortgage declared void on this ground at the 
earliest opportunity. 
26. In light of the observations and findings made, 
we find that the mortgage deed dated 17.10.1990 
constitutes a mortgage by conditional sale under 
Section 58(c) of the Act. The condition converting 
the mortgage into an absolute sale upon default 
is valid and enforceable. The plaintiff failed to 
repay the mortgage amount within the stipulated 
period and did not provide credible evidence of 
any attempt to do so. Moreover, the plaintiff's 
failure to testify personally undermines her case. 
It is also observed that the applicability of Section 
165 of the Code is not established 
27. The Trial Court and the High Court erred in 
disregarding the express terms of the registered 
mortgage deed and in holding that the condition 
was a clog on the equity of redemption without 
sufficient basis. The permissive possession of the 
suit land by the plaintiff does not negate the 
nature of the transaction. The conditions 
stipulated in the mortgage deed fulfil all statutory 
requirements of mortgage by conditional sale, 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
20 
 
and the intention of the parties regarding the 
same was clear and unambiguous. The Trial 
Court and the High Court erred in their 
interpretation by placing undue emphasis on 
possession without considering its permissive 
nature and the explicit terms of the mortgage 
deed. 
28. Only as a caution, we may record here that the 
plaintiff’s possession being admitted to the 
defendant right from the time of the mortgage 
and having continued throughout even till the 
time of filing the suit and even thereafter it would 
be open for the defendant to pursue appropriate 
remedy seeking possession in accordance to law. 
29. The appeals are allowed and the suit filed by the 
plaintiff is dismissed. The judgments and decree 
passed by the High Court of Chhattisgarh at 
Bilaspur in First Appeal No. 28 of 2004 and 
Review Petition No. 222 of 2018, as well as the 
judgment and decree passed by the Additional 
District Judge, Manendragarh, District Korea, in 
Civil Suit No. 26-A/2001, are set aside and the 
suit is dismissed. 

SLP (CIVIL) No.7940-7941 OF 2019 
 
21 
 
30. The Trial Court is directed to refund the entire 
amount deposited by the plaintiff, along with 
accrued interest on the amount in the fixed 
deposit since the date of deposit. 
31. There shall be no order as to costs.
