Civil Appeal Nos. 6776-6777/2013 (Kazi Akiloddin Vs. 
State of Maharashtra & Ors.) 
 
A. Facts 
 
1. 
These Civil Appeals call in question the correctness of the 
judgment dated 17.06.2013 of the High Court of Judicature at 
Bombay, Nagpur Bench, Nagpur in First Appeal No. 1210 of 2008 
(filed by the appellant herein) and First Appeal No. 6 of 2009, which 
was a cross appeal filed by the State of Maharashtra & Ors.  By the 
said judgment, the High Court had dismissed the appeal of the 
appellant. Dealing with the appeal of the State, the High Court, 
while allowing the same, directed that the appellant shall refund the 
excess amount withdrawn with interest @ 9% p.a. from the 
respective dates of withdrawal.  

3 
2. 
The facts lie in a narrow compass. The appellant is the owner 
of the land bearing Survey No.1 admeasuring 1 hectare and 1700 sq. 
meters (1,25,937 sq. ft.) at Mouza Akola (Bujurg), Taluk and 
District Akola.    
3. 
A Section 4 notification under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 
(for short ‘the Act’) was issued for acquisition of the subject land on 
03.06.1999. Prior to this, on 15.11.1998, in view of the proposal to 
acquire the subject land for construction of a flood protection wall, 
the appellant was approached for handing over the subject land on 
the assurance of rental compensation. On 15.11.1998, the possession 
was also taken. A Section 6 notification under the Act was issued on 
02.12.1999.  In the award proceedings, the appellant claimed 
compensation @ of Rs. 500 per sq. ft. On 04.08.2000, the Land 
Acquisition Officer passed an award to the tune of Rs. 5,61,000/- 
per hectare for the subject land, which works out to Rs. 5/- per sq. 
ft. (approx.).   Importantly, in the award, there is no reference to the 
land falling under ‘Blue Zone’ which has become the main issue in 

4 
controversy between the parties before the Reference Court, the 
High Court and this Court.  
4. 
Before the Reference Court, the appellant claimed additional 
compensation of Rs. 4,30,84,000/- @ of Rs. 500/- per sq. ft. for the 
acquired land of 84,481 sq. ft. on the premise that in the said area 43 
plots have been carved out by him. In the break up given for 1 
Hectare, 17 R totalling 1,25,937 sq. ft. following was provided: 
Total under plots area - 84481 sq. ft. (68.3% approx.) 
Total under roads area – 30106 sq. ft. 
  Total under open space area – 11298 sq. ft.  
He also claimed compensation of Rs. 25 lakhs for the expenditure 
made on the road and also prayed for damages of Rs. 50 lakhs. 
Except for claiming expenditure for laying road to the tune of Rs. 
25 lakhs, no enhanced compensation was claimed for an area of 
41,404 sq. ft. (The area of the road and the open space area as stated 
above).  

5 
5. 
Before the Reference Court, the appellant examined himself as 
PW-1, Mohd. Nadir, photographer, was examined as PW-2 and T.N. 
Bhoob, Civil Engineer, was examined as PW-3. The State examined 
K.S. Bhoyar, Sub-Divisional Engineer, as DW-1 and Laxman Bhika 
Raut, Land Acquisition Officer, as DW-2. The appellant in his 
deposition stated that he had planned to convert the land to non-
agricultural purposes. Accordingly, the appellant deposed that he 
had measured and demarcated all the 43 plots in the land; that the 
land was allotted Seat No. 28-D and Plot No. 20 in Akola City Nazul 
record and that the payment receipt evidencing payment for 
conversion to non-agricultural purpose was also available on record. 
The appellant deposed that the land was touching the Akola Gaothan 
and that all the adjacent lands were put to residential use; that the 
surrounding lands have been converted to non-agricultural purpose; 
that the acquired land was within the municipal limits of Akola City 
surrounded by police quarters, other government quarters, Maratha 
Mahasangh Hostel, Swami Vivekanand Ashram, Jaju Housing 
Society, Geeta Nagar, Laxmi Nagar, Sneh Nagar, A.P.M.C. Sub-

6 
Market, Luxury Bus Stand, Dr. Ambedkar Nagar, BR High School 
and Kamala Nagar.  
6.  As exemplars, certified copies of sale transaction dated 
10.05.1999 (exhibit-71) whereby plot no. 50 of an area of 3,000 sq. 
ft. out of layout Survey No. 7/2 purchased for a consideration of Rs. 
5,25,000/- averaging to Rs. 175/- per sq. ft. was produced by the 
appellant. A Sale Deed of 17.11.1999 (exhibit-72) evidencing an 
average price of Rs. 601/- per sq. ft. was also produced. Index of Sale 
Deed of 14.07.1998 @ of Rs. 1047 per sq. ft. (exhibit -73) was 
produced. Sale Deed of 24.08.1998 @ of Rs. 422 per sq. ft. (exhibit-
33) was produced. The appellant/claimant pleaded that the above 
transactions were at a nominal distance of 200 ft. to 500 ft. and on 
that basis, he claimed an additional compensation @ of Rs. 500/- per 
sq. ft. for the 84,481 sq. ft. land as indicated above.  
7.    PW-2 Mohd. Nadir, photographer, also spoke about the land 
being adjacent to the Akola Gaothan and the existence of Rahat 

7 
Nagar Police locality towards west and Maratha Mahasangh towards 
north. Photographs were marked.  
8.   PW-3, T.N. Bhoob, deposed that he referred to the town planning 
development plan at the time of inspection of the property and that 
the acquired land did not fall within the ‘Blue Zone’ area.  
9.   DW-1, K.S. Bhoyar, deposed that a joint measurement was 
carried out and a map was prepared depicting the acquired land. In 
the map, the zones were shown. According to DW-1, the land in 
question in field survey no. 1 was situated in ‘Blue Zone’ and was 
also on the river bed. DW-1 stated that the land was an agricultural 
land but at the relevant time, it was barren and was never converted 
to non-agricultural purpose. According to DW-1, the land was 
valueless as it came under ‘Blue Zone’; that the land was always 
covered by water whenever there was flood and that is the reason 
why the land was taken for the construction of flood protection wall 
and even the appellant executed a Rajinama letter. DW-1 stated that 
he had consulted the Town Planning Authority and collected the 
town planning map also.  

8 
10.  In the cross-examination on 22.01.2008 , DW-1 deposed that he 
had not brought the original map on the basis of which Exh.141 was 
prepared and that he was not in a position to say in which year 
Exh.141 was prepared.  He though added that it could have been 
prepared probably in 1998-99 but even he could not definitely 
provide the date and month of its preparation.  DW-1 also stated that 
after joint measurement, the Taluka Inspector of Land Records 
(TILR) office gave the measurement map and in that map the ‘Blue 
Zone’ is not shown. He denied the suggestion that there was no joint 
measurement and no map was prepared.  
11.   DW-2 Laxman Bhika Raut, Land Acquisition Officer, deposed 
that he visited the site and inspected the same and found the land to 
be in the river bed and comes under ‘Blue Zone’. DW-2 stated that 
in the award he had not noted the location and other descriptions of 
the property and he could not assign any reason as to why he had not 
so mentioned in the award. DW-2 admitted that he did not mention 
in the award about the inspection of the property. DW-2 stated that 
the sale instance referred to in the case of Brijmohan Bhartiya was 

9 
not considered as that land was far away from the suit property. DW-
2 admitted that there was no reference in the award Exh.46 to the 
effect that the suit property was in a 'Blue Zone' and that he could 
not assign any reason why it was not so referred.  
B. Findings of the Reference Court 
12.     The Reference Court, by its judgment dated 02.08.2008, after 
setting out the legal position that the potentiality of the acquired 
lands is to be seen as relevant consideration, set out to analyze the 
evidence. It noticed the deposition of the claimant witnesses to the 
effect that the land was abutting the Akola Gaothan; that adjoining 
properties have been converted to non-agricultural purpose; that the 
suit property was surrounded by residential houses, societies, sub-
markets and luxury bus stand; that maps and photographs 
establishing the said fact have been produced and held that the 
claimant had discharged the initial onus. Dealing with the evidence 
of the State, it held that maps produced at Exh.57 to Exh.59 and 
Exh.141 only showed that a small strip of blue colour was shown as 
passing through the suit property and that it was not clear whether 

10 
the whole area of the property is covered under 'Blue Zone'. It 
highlighted the fact that in the award Exh.46 there was no reference 
about the suit property falling in the 'Blue Zone' and that the said 
factor had no bearing while computing the award amount. After 
discussing the proximity of the property to developed areas, it held 
that the acquired property was within the municipal limit of Akoli 
city and that evidence on record showed that the property was 
surrounded by public offices, roads and Government residential 
quarters.  
13.   The Reference Court held that the Land Acquisition Officer had 
not worked out the market value properly since many relevant factors 
were ignored. It referred to Exh.71 Sale Exemplar dated 10-5-1999 
and the index II extracts at Exh.73(14-7-98) and Exh.74(27-8-1998) 
to conclude that the suit property had high potential value. It noticed 
that under award Exh.46, the suit property (Survey No. 1), Survey 
No. 5/2, Survey No. 7 and Survey No. 2 situated at Akoli (Bk) were 
acquired by the same notification for the same purpose of 
construction of the said protection wall. On that basis, it held that the 

11 
claimants were entitled to get the compensation at the same rate. It 
took on record the certified copy of the award passed in LAC No. 
183 of 2000 dated 15.10.2005 at Exh.88 and found that in that case 
the Reference Court determined the market value @ of Rs. 100/- per 
sq. ft. It also noticed that copy of the award of LAC No. 209 of 2022 
dated 10.08.2006 with regard to Survey No. 6, Survey No. 7 and 
Survey No. 60 of Akoli Khurd were acquired by another notification 
for the same purpose. In that case also, the Reference Court  
determined the market value @ of Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. Though the 
certified copy of the said award was not exhibited, it was taken on 
record as Exh.131 C. Thereafter, it held that the appropriate market 
value would be Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. for the acquired property and 
ordered the same with all the other consequential benefits. 
C. Findings of the High Court 
14.  The appellant and the State filed Appeals and cross Appeals 
before the High Court. The High Court held that on perusal of the 
maps, it was clear that the suit land was just on the bank of the river 
Morna and that the other Survey Nos. 5, 6 and 7 [which were the 

12 
lands acquired in the awards relied upon by the Reference Court] 
were well above survey no. 1 beyond the Gaothan of Akoli (Bk) 
away from the river. The High Court found that Survey Nos. 5, 6 and 
7 were further sub-divided and Survey No. 7/2 had been converted 
to non-agricultural use by order dated 08.07.1982. According to the 
High Court, the sale deed (Exh.71) dated 10.05.1999 was in respect 
of Plot No. 50 admeasuring 3000 sq. ft. from Survey No. 7/2 @ of 
Rs.175 per sq. ft. The High Court held that the sale deed (Exh.71) 
could not be taken into account since the acquired land in the present 
appeals (Survey No. 1) were never converted to non-agricultural use.  
Insofar as the sale deed (Exh.72) dated 17.11.1999 was concerned, it 
rejected the same holding that the sale deed was after the Section 4 
notification and that the sale deed dealt with a small piece of land 
and also appeared to be suspicious for the reason that while Exh.71 
showed value @ of Rs. 175 per sq. ft., Exh.72 which was after the 
notification under Section 4 showed value @ of Rs. 601 per sq. ft. 
Insofar as Exh.33 was concerned, the High Court held that it was not 

13 
shown from which survey number it arose and as to when the 
property was converted to residential use.  
15.     The High Court further held that the acquired land in the appeal 
was situated on the bank of river Morna and relied on the evidence 
of DW-2 Laxman Bhika Raut, the Land Acquisition Officer in 
support of the same. It relied on the findings of the Reference Court 
with regard to the blue colour only affecting a small strip of the land 
and held that the appellant had not seriously challenged the findings. 
It further held that upon perusal of Exh.141 map the finding of the 
Reference Court that only a small strip of land was affected by blue 
colour was also wrong since in Exh.141, major area of the suit land 
was in the 'Blue Zone'. Thereafter, it held that since the suit property 
was affected by the 'Blue Zone', the same could not have been 
converted into non-agricultural use like other adjoining survey 
numbers and observed that perhaps that was why  no attempt to 
convert the land to non-agricultural use was made. It relied on 
Exh.67 dated 25.02.2000 which was a communication by the 
Assistant Director, Town Planning, Akola to the Land Acquisition 

14 
Officer. That letter mentioned in para 2 that the acquired land in the 
appeal fell in a no development zone and as such was not eligible to 
be converted to non-agricultural purpose.  
16.   Thereafter, the High Court concluded that the suit land was not 
having non-agricultural potential unlike Survey Nos. 5/2, 6, 7 and 8. 
It held that the award @ of Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. was incorrect. It 
rejected the contention about the proposed layout of 43 plots since 
the land could not be converted.  
17.   In spite of noticing that certain areas claimed by the appellant 
as developed areas were reckoned and excluded from the 
computation of market value, the High Court still held that the value 
required for carrying out development ought to be deducted. Holding 
so, it held that deduction to the extent of 70% area was required to 
be made and as such went on to allow the appeal of the State and 
restored the award of the Land Acquisition Officer. It further ordered 
refund by the appellant of the compensation withdrawn with interest 
@ 9% p.a. Ultimately, the Appeal of the appellant was dismissed and 

15 
that of the State allowed. Aggrieved, the appellant is in Civil Appeal 
Nos.  6776-6777 of 2013 before us.  
D. Contentions:  
18.     Mr. Himanshu Chaubey, learned counsel, diligently presented 
the case for the appellant.  Learned Counsel  contended that Exh.141 
was prepared on the basis of another map and admittedly the original 
map was never produced in Court; that under Section 83 of the Indian 
Evidence Act, plans made for the purpose of any cause must be 
proved to be accurate; that DW-1 K.S. Bhoyar (Sub Divisional 
Engineer) deposed that Exh.141 was prepared as part of joint 
measurement to show the exact situation of the land and hence 
presumption of Section 83 is not available to the State; that Exh.141 
was at best a secondary evidence and is admissible only if it is proved 
that the original has been destroyed or lost or when the party offering 
evidence of its contents cannot, for any other reason not arising from 
his own default or neglect, produce it in a reasonable time and as 
such argued that the ingredients for admitting secondary evidence 
has not been established.    

16 
19.     Learned counsel further argued that there was no notification 
or order brought on record by the respondent to prove that the subject 
land was specified as a 'Blue Zone' and that the development plan, 
as placed on record by the appellant, showed that no markings were 
present. Learned counsel relied on Section 14(j) and 22(j) of the 
Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 (hereinafter 
referred to as the 'MRTP Act') to contend that the master plan must 
show the flood control area as the 'Blue Zone’ and contended that no 
such marking was in the master plan. Learned counsel argued that no 
rules or regulations have been brought on record to prove that 
respondent no. 2 the Special Land Acquisition Officer is authorized 
to prepare the map in the absence of any order; that the High Court 
erred in only going by the evidence of DW-1, particularly when  
DW-1 did not remember as to when the map was made and 
furthermore the author of the map-Sh. A.K. Kulkarni was also not 
examined. Learned Counsel relied on the affidavit filed by the State 
of Maharashtra dated 02.04.2024, to buttress his submission.  

17 
20.     Learned counsel contends that admittedly as on the date of 
issuance of Section 4 notification i.e. 03.06.1999, the blue zone lines 
had not been demarcated and the construction was solely governed 
by the 1974 byelaws. Learned counsel contends that even the 
documents sought to be relied upon by the respondent-State have 
been brought on record for the first time before this Court and 
admittedly other than the map i.e. Exh.141, no other document has 
been brought on record to establish that the land of the appellant fell 
under the 'Blue Zone'. Learned Counsel contends that the High Court 
has failed to consider Exh.52, namely, the map issued by the 
Authority whereby the land of the appellant was granted Nazul Sheet 
No. 28-D and Plot No. 20. Learned counsel contends that any land 
for which Nazul Sheet is issued is considered as a non-agricultural 
land and relies on the award dated 05.02.2008 in relation to 
acquisition of Survey No. 11 Shahnawazpur, Akola City. Learned 
counsel contended that the Land Acquisition Officer did not whisper 
about the 'Blue Zone' issue in his award; and that the Land 
Acquisition Officer proceeded on the basis of the exemplar from 

18 
Survey No. 9/1A and the issue of the 'Blue Zone' was raised for the 
first time before the Reference Court.  
21.   Learned counsel argued that the potentiality of the land as 
established by the evidence has been ignored by the High Court. 
Learned counsel submits that pending the Appeal before the High 
Court, the Income Tax Department had passed an order dated 
31.08.2012 wherein the land of the appellant was considered as an 
urban land and a non-agricultural land. Learned counsel stated that 
the respondent in the said proceedings did not object to the same and 
rather acceded to the finding that the land of appellant which is 
acquired is a non-agricultural land.  
22.   Learned counsel relying on the standardized building byelaws 
and Government resolution of 02.04.1974 contended that the 
acquired land was not in a no-construction zone and argued that the 
State Authorities have failed to bring on record any document to 
establish any average flood mark. Learned Counsel stated that as per 
the Joint Measurement Report submitted by the respondent-State 
Irrigation Department before this Court, the distance between the 

19 
land of the appellant and the defined boundary of the water course is 
between 15 to 20 meters and therefore, as per the extant byelaws the 
land of the appellant is outside the no-construction zone. The learned 
counsel argued that the said Joint Measurement Report was prepared 
by the respondent at the time of the acquisition and has even been 
referred to in the evidence of DW-1. It is stated that DW-1 further 
admitted that based on Exh.32 there was an open land between the 
river Morna and Survey No. 1. According to the learned counsel, the 
explanation offered by the VIDC (Vidarbha Irrigation  Development 
Corporation) during the hearing that the gap is due to the curved bank 
of the river and ought not to be considered as a gap is unacceptable. 
According to the learned counsel, such an argument is itself an 
admission to the fact that firstly the land of the appellant was at a 
height from the river and secondly that there is a gap between the 
river and the land of the appellant. According to the learned counsel 
for the appellant, the width of the flood wall is 30 meters taking the 
measurement from the defined boundary water course till the end of 
the wall; that as per the Joint Measurement Map the width of the 

20 
appellant land is on an average between 50 to 55 meters and the 
counsel contended that hence the total distance from the boundary of 
the water course till the end of the appellant land is 65 meters. 
Learned counsel contended that in spite of the rules declaring that 
only land upto 15 meters from the defined boundary of the water 
course as falling under the no development zone, the whole land of 
the appellant has been considered as falling under the no 
development zone.  
23.      The learned counsel assailed the finding of the High Court 
about failure to convert the land to non-agricultural by contending 
that the appellant had obtained a Nazul Plot No. from the revenue 
authority and carved out 43 plots and even fees were paid and the 
receipt was placed on record; and that the only reason why steps 
could not be taken was in the meantime Section 4 notification came 
to be issued. Learned counsel contended that sale instances cited 
have not been taken into consideration by the High Court. In this 
regard, he relied on Exh.33 (Rs. 422 per sq. ft.), Exh.71 (Rs. 175 per 
sq. ft.) and the sale index of Survey No. 5/1,in Akholi Bk  where 

21 
there was a transaction of sale deed dated 12.02.1999 of Rs. 
1,50,000/- for 1500 Sq. ft. area of plot no 78. Learned counsel 
contended that the highest exemplar should have been considered. 
Learned counsel argues that the question of development charges 
does not arise since that purpose of acquisition did not entail any 
development.  
24.   Mr. Uday B. Dube, learned Counsel for the Vidarbha Irrigation 
Development Corporation (VIDC) strongly opposed the appellant’s 
submissions and contended that admittedly the land is situated on the 
bank of the river and concurrent findings have been recorded in that 
regard. Learned counsel placed reliance on the evidence of DW-1 in 
respect of the location of the land. Learned counsel relied on Exh.67 
dated 25.02.2000 wherein it is recorded that Survey No. 1 fell in a 
no development zone. Learned counsel relied on the evidence of 
DW-2-the Special Land Acquisition Officer. Learned Counsel 
argued that the soil for the wall was obtained from digging the land 
of the appellant. Learned counsel submits that the appellant in spite 
of being a developer has not obtained a non-agricultural use 

22 
permission; learned counsel contends that the land was prone to 
floods and that the award of Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. in the case of 
appellant was totally untenable. Learned counsel stated that the map 
relied upon by the appellant to show that there was a road in between 
the land of the appellant and river is completely incorrect and that 
the dotted land denoted the slope. Learned counsel prayed that the 
map produced during the hearing in this Court should be rejected. 
25.     Insofar as the issue of 'Blue Zone' is concerned, learned counsel 
contended that it was the duty of the Irrigation Department to draw 
blue or red line and that the Irrigation Department has done its duty. 
In the written submission of VIDC, it is categorically averred as 
follows :- 
“Mere failure on the part of the Town Planning Department 
to give effect to it in Development Plan would not have any 
bearing on the valuation”. 
26.   Learned counsel submitted that three sale deeds produced in the 
matter of Bhartiyas (LAC No. 183) were suspicious transactions 

23 
between related parties, and hence prayed that the Appeals be 
dismissed.  
27.   We have also heard Mr. Shrirang B. Varma, the learned counsel 
for the State who has placed reliance on the affidavit dated 
02.04.2024 filed by them pursuant to the order of 20.03.2024. We 
have considered the affidavit in detail hereinbelow. 
28.  We have given our anxious consideration to the contentions 
urged by the parties. 
E. Questions 
29.   The following questions arise for consideration: 
 (i) What should be the market value of the land of the appellant 
as on 03.06.1999? To answer this, the following further 
questions need to be considered. 
(a)  Does the site of the appellant fall within ‘Blue Zone’ as 
contended by the acquiring body –VIDC? 

24 
(b) If it falls within the ‘Blue Zone’, what should be the market 
value for the land? 
(c)  If the land or any part thereof is not to be determined as a 
‘Blue Zone’, what was the ‘No Construction Zone’ as per the 
extant laws and what should be the market value payable for that 
portion? 
(d) What should be the market value payable for any portion, 
falling outside the ‘No Construction Zone’? 
Reasoning and conclusion: 
We have considered question no. 1(a) to 1(d) together for 
convenience. 
30.  During the course of hearing on 20th March, 2024, we made the 
following order: 
“1. Arguments by the parties remained inconclusive. Meanwhile, 
original records have been requisitioned. 
2. Learned counsel for the parties seek and are granted time to 
inspect the original record and make further submissions. 

25 
3. An officer of the Irrigation Department is present along with 
some latest photographs of the site. However, he has not brought 
the original record regarding fixation of blue line by the Irrigation 
Department in purported exercise of its power under the 
Maharashtra Regional & Town Planning Act, 1966. 
4. Mr. Uday B. Dube, learned counsel for the respondent 
Corporation undertakes to produce such record.” 
31.  Pursuant to the said Order, a duly sworn affidavit of 2nd April, 
2024 has been filed by the Assistant Director of Town Planning 
(Branch Office, District Akola) which reveals certain telling facts. 
The affidavit states that its contents are confined to marking of flood 
lines in the city Akola and the maps thereof. It avers that the land in 
question in these Appeals was situated outside the Municipal 
Council of Akola which fact, however, is disputed by the appellant. 
Be that as it may, the affidavit acknowledges that under Section 14(j) 
of the MRTP Act, the proposals for irrigation, water supply and 
hydro-electric, works, flood control and prevention of river pollution 
are the constituents of the regional plan. It further avers that as per 
the provisions of Section 22(j) of the MRTP Act, the proposals for 
flood control and prevention of river pollution are constituents of the 
development plan.  

26 
32.  Digressing a bit from the affidavit, it may be pointed out herein 
that under the MRTP Act, Section 2(25) defines regional plan to 
mean a plan for the development or redevelopment of a region which 
is approved by the State Government and has come into operation 
under the Act. Under Section 21, development plan is defined to 
mean a plan for the development or redevelopment of the area within 
the jurisdiction of a planning authority and includes revision of a 
development plan and proposals of a special planning authority for 
development of land within its jurisdiction. Section 14 which deals 
with the contents of the regional plan along with sub-clauses - a and 
j are extracted herein below:  
“14. Contents of Regional Plan 
Subject to the provisions of this Act and any rules made thereunder 
for regulating the form of a Regional Plan and the manner in which 
it may be published, any such Regional plan shall indicate the 
manner in which the Regional Board propose that land in the 
Region should be used, whether by carrying out thereon 
development or otherwise, the stages by which any such 
development is to be carried out, the network of communications 
and transport, the proposals for conservation and development of 
natural resources, and such other matters as are likely to have an 
important influence on the development of the Region; and any 
such plan in particular, may provide for all or any of the following 

27 
matters, or for such matters thereof as the State Government may 
direct, that is to say- 
(a) allocation of land for different uses, general distribution and 
general locations of land, and the extent to which the land may be 
used as residential, industrial, agricultural, or as forest, or for 
mineral exploitation; 
xxx    xxx 
(j) proposals for irrigation, water supply and hydro-electric works, 
flood control and prevention of river pollution;” 
 
33.  Section 21 speaks of the Development plan and Section 22 
which speaks of the contents of the development plan, insofar as they 
are relevant, are extracted herein below: 
“21. Development Plan 
(1) As soon as may be after the commencement of this Act, but not 
later than three years after such commencement, and subject 
however to the provisions of this Act, every Planning Authority 
shall carry out a survey, prepare an existing land-use map and 
prepare a draft Development plan for the area within its 
jurisdiction, in accordance with the provisions of a Regional plan, 
where there is such a plan [publish a notice in the Official Gazette 
and in such other manner as may be prescribed stating that the draft 
Development plan has been prepared] and submit the plan to the 
State Government for sanction. The Planning Authority shall also 
submit a quarterly Report to the State Government about the 
progress made in carrying out the survey and prepare the plan. 
22. Contents of Development Plan 

28 
A Development plan shall generally indicate the manner in which 
the use of development land in the area of a Planning Authority 
shall be regulated, and also indicate the manner in which the 
development of land therein shall be carried out. In particular, it 
shall provide so far as may be necessary for all or any of the 
following matters, that is to say,— 
(a) proposals for allocating the use of land for purposes, such as 
residential, industrial, commercial, agricultural, recreational; 
.... 
(j) proposals for food control and prevention of river pollution;” 
34.  Reverting to the affidavit of the State dated 02.04.2024, the 
affidavit avers that the draft regional plan was of the year 2002 and 
the draft development plan (revised) was of the year 2000. It is 
averred that under Section 26(1) of the MRTP Act, the publication 
of notice of draft development plan was of 03.02.2000. The affidavit 
avers that the notice of regional plan for Akoli Washim District in 
draft form under Section 16 was published on 25.12.2002. The draft 
regional plan itself is of 2002 and the affidavit indicates that it was 
sanctioned under Section 15(1) of the MRTP Act on 23.04.2012 and 
came into force on 15.06.2012.  

29 
35.  The State makes out a case that both for the draft regional plan 
of 2002 for the Akola Washim region as well as draft development 
plan (revised) 2000, the blue and red flood lines which have been 
produced by the concerned Executive Engineer, Irrigation Section 
Akola vide letter dated 18.01.1999 were taken into consideration as 
constituents. It is a case that the blue and red flood lines were shown 
on the maps of the peripheral plan of the Akoli City based on the 
proposal of the Executive Engineer.  
36.  The affidavit has certain other interesting averments. It avers 
that the development plan for the original limits of the Akola 
Municipal Council was in force from 01.04.1977 where Survey no. 
1 wherein appellant’s land is situated, was not included in the No 
Development Zone. Thereafter, the development plan for the 
extended limits of the Akola Municipal Council was sanctioned by 
the Government on 30.12.1992 and came into force from  
01.03.1993. In the said development plan, the affidavit states that the 
land in question was not part of the sanctioned development plan. 

30 
The affidavit states that the Municipal Council was converted into 
Municipal Corporation since 01.10.2001 and that the revised 
development plan which came into force on 15.12.2004 also did not 
include the appellant’s land. Thereafter, the following crucial paras 
occur in affidavit which have a great bearing in deciding the present 
controversy, particularly the issue as to whether the land of the 
appellant falls in the Blue Zone:-  
“vii. Meanwhile, the Regional Plan for Akola – Washim Region 
was published in the year 2002 wherein for the first time the Blue 
and Red flood lines were incorporated by taking into consideration 
the letter and circular of the concerned Irrigation Department as 
mentioned above. The said map of the Peripheral Plan of the said 
Regional Plan which further has been sanctioned by the 
Government in Urban Development Department vide Notification 
No. TPS-2502/205/CR-106/2009/UD-30, dated 23.04.2012 which 
came in force from 15.06.2012. 
viii) According to the Peripheral Plan of the said Regional Plan, 
the land bearing Survey No. 1 of Mouza Akoli (Budruk) was 
included in the "Agriculture Zone/No Development Zone and also 
the part of this land is situated within the River Bank and Blue 
Flood Line, whereas, the other lands bearing Survey No. 6 and 7 
of Mouza Akoli (Khurd) are included in Residential Zone. A true 
copy of the part plan of the said Peripherial Plan showing the 
aforesaid lands is annexed herewith and marked as Annexure R-5. 
ix) Now, the Development Plan for the whole limits of the 
Municipal Corporation, Akola named as Draft Development Plan 

31 
of Original Limit (2nd revision) + First Extended Limit (R.) + 2nd 
Extended Limit is being prepared for which notices has been 
published in the Maharashtra Government Gazette dated 25 - 
31/01/2024 under the provisions of the section 26 of MRTP Act 
and further process is in progress as per the legal framework of the 
said Act. 
x) According to the said draft Development Plan, the land under 
reference bearing Survey No. 1 & 7 of Mouza Akola (Budruk) and 
other lands bearing Survey No.6, 7 & 60 of Mouza Akoli (Khurd) 
are proposed to be included in 'Residential Zone'.  
In the said draft proposed development plan, the Blue and Red 
Flood lines are shown as per the information available from Akola 
Irrigation Department, Akola vide letter No. 5396/Line- 1/2023, 
dated 06/10/2023. A true copy of the letter dated 06.10.2023 is 
annexed herewith and marked as Annexure R-6. 
xi) The land under reference bearing Survey No.1 of Mouza Akoli 
(Budruk) is situated between the Blue and Red Flood lines.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
37. The affidavit clearly indicates that on the date of Section 4 
notification i.e. 03.06.1999 there was no published notice of draft 
regional plan or draft development plan. The attempt made is to rely 
on the letter of the Executive Engineer of 18.01.1999 containing 
proposals for demarcation of red and blue lines. The affidavit further 
avers that on 03.06.1999 the statutory scheme that was in force was 
the Standardized Building Byelaws and Development Control Rules 

32 
for ‘B’ and ‘C’ Class Municipal Councils of Maharashtra which were 
applicable for the outside Municipal limits as per Government 
resolution dated 02.04.1974. The affidavit avers that according to 
Rule No. 17.1.2 no permission to construct a building on a site shall 
be granted, if  
“the site is within 9 (nine) meters of the highest water mark, and if 
there be major water course nearby the distance of the plots from 
the same shall be 9 m. from average high flood mark or 15 mt. from 
the defined boundary of water course whichever is more." 
38. The appellant has filed a response to the affidavit on 15.04.2024. 
The appellant has pointed out that the map annexed to the Engineer’s 
letters as produced by the State Government in its affidavit of 
02.04.2024 is at variance with Exh.141 produced before the 
Reference Court and submits that either of them cannot be correct. 
The appellant also controverts the fact that the land was outside the 
municipal limits and relies on the letter of 25.02.2000 issued by the 
Deputy Director, Town Planning indicating that the land was within 

33 
the municipal limits. The appellant avers that as on date of the 
acquisition admittedly none of the sanctioned development/regional 
plan demarcated the whole area of survey no. 1 as No Development 
Zone. The appellant also relied on the Standardized Building 
Byelaws and Development Control Rules for ‘B’ and ‘C’ Class 
Municipal Councils of Maharashtra referred to in the affidavit of the 
State Government.  
39.   In the written submissions of the appellant, it is submitted that 
since there is no valid document determining the flood mark, the no 
construction zone will have to be determined with reference to the 
defined boundary of the major water course. According to the 
appellant, as per the Joint Measurement Report submitted by the 
respondent-Irrigation Department, the distance between the land of 
the appellant and the defined boundary of the water course is 15 to 
20 meters. The appellant disputes the explanation of the VIDC that 
the dotted lines indicate the curved bank of the river.  

34 
40.   Be that as it may, the appellant submits that as per the Joint 
Measurement Map, the width of the appellant land is between 50 to 
55 meters. The appellant submits that the extant rules declare that 
only in land up till 15 meters from the defined boundary of the water 
course shall fall in the no development zone and as such the whole 
land could not have been considered as falling under no development 
zone.  
41.    Having considered the facts and circumstances including the 
affidavit of the State filed before us, we are constrained to hold that 
the High Court was not justified in declaring the entire land of the 
appellant as falling within the blue zone.  
42.  As has been demonstrated hereinabove, the statutory documents 
under the MRTP Act demarcating the blue zone/blue line came in its 
draft form only in 2000 as far as the development plan was concerned 
and in 2002 as far as the regional plan was concerned. The Section 4 
notification under the Act in this case is of 03.06.1999. Before the 
Reference Court, the document that was available was Exh.141 map. 

35 
However, we are not inclined to place any reliance on the same for 
the reason that DW-1 K.S. Bhoyar, Sub-Divisional Engineer, who 
filed his affidavit in chief on 05.01.2008 clearly deposed that he was 
not in a position to definitely say as to in which year Exh.141 was 
prepared. He also deposed that he had not brought the original map 
on the basis of which Exh.141 was prepared. Since under the MRTP 
Act, there is a procedure for notifying the plans and since the whole 
process commenced after the Section 4 notification dated 03.06.1999 
was issued, it will be very unsafe to proceed on the basis of the 
proposal, if any, in the letter of the Executive Engineer dated 
18.01.1999, though it may have the basis for ultimately drafting the 
regional plan and the development plan.  
43.   If an acquiring body relies on a statutory injunction, to establish 
that the land has no potential, then the burden is on the said acquiring 
body to demonstrate without any ambiguity that such a statutory 
interdict is in place. In the present case, the VIDC has not discharged 
the burden in demonstrating that statutorily there was a valid 

36 
demarcation of a “Blue Zone” on the date of the Section 4 
notification, under the Act. What has been established is only the 
existence of the byelaw i.e. “Standardised Building Byelaws and 
Development Control Rules for “B” and “C” Class Municipal 
Councils of Maharashtra”. 
44.  The statutory regime that was in force admittedly, according to 
the State, was the Standardized Building Byelaws and Development 
Control Rules for ‘B’ and ‘C’ class Municipal Councils of 
Maharashtra which by a Government resolution of 02.04.1974 was 
even made applicable to lands outside Municipal limits. Going by 
that, the building permissions could be denied only if the site was 
within 9 meters of the highest water mark and if there be a major 
water course nearby, the distance of the plot from the same shall be 
9 meters from the average high flood mark or 15 meters from the 
defined boundary of water course whichever is more.  
45.  There is no definitive evidence on record to indicate as to what 
was the highest water mark or the average high flood mark, with the 

37 
result we conclude, in the peculiar facts of the case, that as on 
03.06.1999, i.e. the date of the Section 4 notification for the 
appellant’s land, the no construction zone can only be taken as 15 
meters from the defined boundary of the water course which is the 
Morna river. If the site to the extent it is within the 15 meters of the 
defined boundary of water course, that part alone could be said to 
have no potential for development. The land beyond the 15 meters 
mark from the defined boundary of the water course in the site of the 
appellant should be treated independently and as to what would be 
the value thereof, we shall discuss herein below. For the land up to 
15 meters (in the event of the site or part of the site falling within 15 
meters of the defined boundary of the water course) shall be paid the 
amount as determined by the Land Acquisition Officer in the award 
dated 04.08.2000. 
46.  Now that we have concluded that the land of the appellant except 
to the extent of 15 meters from the defined boundary of the water 
course is not covered by the no construction zone, the question arises 
as to what should be the market value payable as on 03.06.1999.  As 

38 
has been narrated earlier, the LAO in his Award (Exh. 46) awarded 
an amount of Rs.5,61,000/- per hectare for the entire extent of      
1,25, 937 sq. ft. which works out to Rs. 5/- per sq. ft.  The Land 
Acquisition Officer relied on a sale transaction pertaining to one 
parcel of land in Survey No. 9/1A dated 24.04.1998.  On a reference 
under Section 18, after noticing the status of the land and after 
concluding that the land is not covered under the blue zone and after 
finding that the Land Acquisition Officer made no reference to the 
land being on the blue zone in the award, the Reference Court 
awarded a sum of Rs.100/- per sq. ft.   
47.   The Reference Court found that the property was within the 
Akoli City Municipal limits and referring to Exh. 71, 73 and 74 had 
concluded that the land had high potential and value.  Thereafter, it 
relied on the award of the Reference Court in LAC No. 183 of 2000 
(Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6820 of 2023 and Civil 
Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 2753 of 2023) and LAC No. 209 
of 2002 dated 10.08.2006 (Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 

39 
6817 of 2023  and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 2324 of 
2023) which are appeals in this very batch. 
48.  Our discussion hereinbelow on LAC No.183/2000 dated 
15.01.2015 shall insofar as they are relevant, also apply to the 
disposal by this judgment of Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 
6820 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP(C) No. 2753 of 
2023.  Similarly, our discussion on LAC No. 209 of 2002 dated 
10.08.2006 shall insofar as they are relevant also apply to the 
disposal by this judgment of Civil Appeal arising out of SLP(C) No. 
6817 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP(C) No. 2324 of 
2023. 
49.  In Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6820 of 2023 and 
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 2753 of 2023, the Section 4 
notification was common.  In those appeals, the land was situated in 
Survey No. 7/2 of Akoli Village Bujurg (Bk).  The Reference Court 
by judgment dated 15.01.2005 in LAC No. 183 of 2000 awarded Rs. 
100 per sq. ft. which was the same rate awarded in LAC No. 209 of 

40 
2002 dated 10.08.2006, though in those matters lands were situated 
in Survey Nos. 6,7 and 60 at Akoli Khurd Village.   
50.   In matters involved in LAC No. 183 of 2000, the Land 
Acquisition Collector awarded Rs.5,61,000/- per hectare. It is 
important to note that even though the land was situated in Survey 
No. 7/2 of Akoli Bujurg, the Land Acquisition Collector awarded 
equal value for the lands in Survey No. 1 (the present appeals) as 
well as Survey No. 7/2 and the Reference Court also awarded 
Rs.100/- per sq. ft. for both the Survey Nos.  
51.   In LAC No. 209 of 2002, the Land Acquisition Officer awarded 
Rs.72,400/- per hectare for the land situated in Survey Nos, 6,7 and 
60 of Akoli Khurd Village.  The Reference Court and the High Court 
have awarded Rs.100/- per sq. ft. even for those set of lands, for 
plotted area of 359684.44 sq. ft. 
52.  The only reason why in the present the High Court did not award 
Rs.100/- per sq. ft. was the finding that the land was on the blue zone, 
which 
finding 
we 
have 
already 
set 
aside.                           

41 
The Land Acquisition Officer found similarity between the lands that 
are subject matter of LAC No. 183 of 2000 dated 15.01.2005 and the 
present land. If we are persuaded to hold that the order of the 
Reference Court in LAC No.183 of 2000 with regard to the land in 
Survey No. 7/2 of Akola Bujurg Village is correct then there is no 
reason why the same value should not be awarded to the present 
appellant except to that extent of the land, if any, falling within the 
15 meters restriction from the defined boundary of the water course 
as explained earlier.   
53.  If we peruse the award of the Reference Court dated 15.01.2005 
in LAC No. 183 of 2000, as an exemplar, a sale deed marked in that 
case as (Exh. 45) executed by one Usha Santosh Gode in favour of 
Ashok Krushnarao Sapkal dated 12.02.1999 in respect of plot no. 78 
was relied upon. This is the sale deed set out in the present case in 
the claim statement as well as in IA No. 85664 of 2019 which is an 
application for permission to file additional documents as Annexure-
A3.  Though what is given in the present case is an index of sale-

42 
purchase details as on 21.05.1999, the sale Exh.45 referred to in C.A. 
arising out if SLP (C) No. 6820 of 2023 and C.A. arising out of SLP 
(C) No. 2753 of 2023, is mentioned at entry No. 8 dated 12.02.1999.  
There an extent of 1500 sq. ft. was sold for Rs.1,50,000/- which 
would be @ 100 per sq. ft.  Ultimately in the order of the Reference 
Court in LAC No. 183 of 2000 dated 15.01.2005, the Court 
considered the valuation offered by the valuer in that case of Rs.200/-  
per sq. ft.; sale instance of Rs.175/- per sq. ft. in one of the exemplars 
and after reducing the value of the land for fluctuations in the market 
value and the prevailing ambience had arrived at a figure of    
Rs.100/-. This coincidentally tallies with the sale instance mentioned 
in Exh. 45 therein.  In that case, other statutory benefits were 
awarded.  
54.   Be that as it may, in law what is mandated is to examine the 
potentiality of the land.  Indisputably, by a common award the 
appellant’s land and the land in Survey No. 7/2 in Akoli Bujurg were 
treated on par by the Land Acquisition Officer.  Admittedly, the 

43 
surrounding areas have lands for which non-agricultural permission 
had been given.  It has also come in evidence that the land is in a 
locality surrounded by bustling commercial establishments and 
educational institutions and even the evidence of the acquiring body 
admits that the Tehsil’s office and Collector’s office in Akola 
District and Akola Taluk are located in the nearby area (evidence of 
DW-1).  Photographs produced by PW-2 also show that there have 
been developments around the area.     
55.  The question here is whether in the present appeals the Reference 
Court was justified in following the award in LAC No. 183 of 2000.  
The High Court has held that the land fell in the blue zone which 
finding we have set aside. It further held that while the land of the 
appellant was on the bank of the river Morna, other Survey Nos., 
namely, Survey Nos. 5, 6 and 7 were above Survey No.1 and beyond 
the Gaothan of Akoli Bk. and away from the bank of river Morna.  It 
also held that Survey No.7/2 was converted into non-agricultural use. 
It held that Survey No. 1 was never converted to non-agricultural 

44 
land and hence Exh.71 sale deed of 10.05.1999 could not be relied 
upon.  The High Court also relied on Exh.67 a letter dated 
25.02.2000 wherein it is mentioned in para therein that Survey No. 
1 (suit land) Survey No. 5/2, Survey Nos. 5/1, 7, 8 2, 25, 9/1-A of 
mauza Akoli fell in the no Development zone and therefore could 
not be converted into non-agricultural purpose though the said lands 
fell within the municipal town. This finding has been countered by 
the appellant by stating that in fact non-agricultural permission has 
been granted for Survey Nos.5/1, 7 8, 9/1-A and 28 in the written 
submissions. The same has not been converted by the respondent-
authorities.  
56.  The surrounding land to the appellant’s land has already been 
converted and the appellant has been granted the Nazul sheet and 
necessary charges have also been paid. We say nothing more on this 
aspect except that while determining the market value we are really 
concerned with the potentiality of the land. If except to the extent of 
15 meters from the defined boundary of the water course the other 

45 
land was not in the no construction zone, there is no reason why the 
same market value could not be awarded. In view of the above, 
considering the potentiality of the land and its situs, except for the 
lands upto 15 meters from the defined boundary of the water course, 
we are inclined to award Rs.100/- per sq.ft. for 68.3% of the total 
admeasuring area.  It should not be forgotten that the LAO treated 
the land in Survey No. 7 Akoli Bk. No.1, namely, the appellant’s 
land alike. The Reference Court also awarded them @ Rs. 100/-.  The 
High Court proceeded on the basis that the land was purportedly in 
the blue zone and set aside the order of the Reference Court and the 
award.  
57.  We are inclined to restore the award insofar as the land if any 
within the 15 meters of the defined boundary of the water course and 
for the rest of the land in Survey No.1 belonging to the appellant for 
the 68.3% of the balance area, we award the rate of Rs.100/- per sq.ft.   
58.  LAC No. 209 of 2002 dated 10.08.2006, is the Reference Court 
order which is under consideration in C.A. No. @ SLP (C) No. 6817 

46 
of 2023 and C.A. No. @ SLP (C) No. 2324 of 2023 which are part 
of this very batch of matters. The Land involved in the said reference 
case is situated in village Akoli Khurd bearing Survey Nos. 6, 7 and 
60. Here again, the Section 4 notification was issued on 03.06.1999. 
The lands were no doubt converted to non-agricultural use on 
03.03.1983. 
59.  The plot area involved in LAC No. 209/2002 is 33415.50 sq. mts 
and the applicants were claiming for the plotted area and not 
claiming compensation for the open area and roads. In LAC No. 
209/2002, the LAO awarded Rs. 72,400 per hectare resulting in a 
reference under Section 18. There is no case for the government that 
the land is adjacent to Morna river. The Land in question in LAC No. 
209/2002 was situated near several educational and other religious 
institutions. The claim for enhancement in LAC No. 209/2002 was 
based on Exh. 78 dated 10/11.05.1999 where plot no. 50 Survey No. 
7/2 of Akoli Bk. was sold @ Rs. 175/- per sq. ft. The LAO admits 
that the Akoli (Bk) and Akoli Khurd are adjoining twin villages. It is 

47 
also recorded that the lands lying therein are similar in nature. Based 
on the previous award Rs.100/- per sq. ft. was awarded. The High 
Court upheld the said award. Exh. 75 was the sale deed of 12.02.2009 
of plot no. 75 of Akola Survey No.8 and Survey No. 5/1. The price 
in the said sale deed was Rs. 100 per sq.ft. for an area of 1500 sq.ft. 
This is the document which is Exh.45 in C.A.No. @ SLP (C) No. 
6820 0f 2023 and C.A. No. @ SLP (C) No. 2753 of 2023 and this 
document is also one of the basis for the enhancement.  According 
to our conclusion in this batch of appeals, decided hereinabove, the 
High Court was right in rejecting the other sale deeds.  
Relevant Legal Principles: 
60.    It is well settled that in determining the compensation the court 
would take into consideration the potentialities of the land existing 
as on the date of the notification published under Section 4(1) (State 
of Orissa vs. Brij Lal Misra and Others, (1995) 5 SCC 203) 
61.   This Court in Sardara Singh and Others v. Land Acquisition 
Collector, Improvement Trust, Rupnagar and Others, (2020) 14 

48 
SCC 483, has held that the rates of compensation awarded in 
adjacent villages cannot be disregarded if in the given set of facts 
and evidence, similarity is established.  Similarly, in Om Parkash 
and Others v. State of Haryana, (2016) 13 SCC 190, the Court held 
that compensation awarded in the adjoining village can be 
considered when there was similarity in potentiality. [See also 
Special Land Acquisition Officer v. Karigowda and Others, (2010) 
5 SCC 708]. In view of this settled position of law, we see no ground 
to interfere with this finding.  
62.   When there is a choice between an exemplar where the 
transaction is between unrelated parties dealing at arm's length and 
between an exemplar where the transaction is between related parties 
of a higher value, both of which are broadly around the same period, 
prudence would dictate and common sense would command that we 
accept the value of set out in the transaction between unrelated 
parties. We are inclined to accept the transaction which is at arm’s 

49 
length and accept the market value of the amount of Rs. 100/- per sq. 
ft. and reject the claim of Rs. 175/- per sq. ft. 
63.  It is well settled that market value is determined based on the 
price of a willing buyer- a willing seller at arm’s length. In 
Administrator General of West Bengal Vs. Collector, Varanasi 
(1988) 2 SCC 150, it was held : 
“8. The determination of market value of a piece of land with 
potentialities for urban use is an intricate exercise which calls for 
collection and collation of diverse economic criteria. The market 
value of a piece of property, for purposes of Section 23 of the Act, 
is stated to be the price at which the property changes hands from 
a willing seller to a willing, but not too anxious a buyer, dealing at 
arm’s length. The determination of market value, as one author put 
it, is the prediction of an economic event viz. the price outcome of 
a hypothetical sale, expressed in terms of probabilities. Prices 
fetched for similar lands with similar advantages and potentialities 
under bonafide transactions of sale at or about the time of the 
preliminary notification are the usual, and indeed the best, 
evidences of market value. Other methods of valuation are resorted 
to if the evidence of sale of similar lands is not available.” 
 
64.  In this case, when we have two exemplars, one between two 
independent parties and the other between two admittedly related parties 
and both transactions have taken place without much of a time gap. 

50 
65.  Insofar as the where the exemplar is a small extent of land is 
concerned, it is now clear that even in these lands in Survey No. 1 where 
the permission is not yet obtained, except to the extent of those lands 
falling within the 15 meters from the defined boundary of the water 
course, they were also ripe for use for building purposes and hence to 
adopt the same value as was done in the case of sale deed dated 
12.02.1999 @ Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. is justified. There is evidence on record 
to the effect that the area was plotted to the extent of 7948 sq. mtrs. and 
there were 43 plots.  It is also in evidence given by them that roads were 
constructed.  Though this is disputed in the evidence of the acquiring 
body, the evidence led by them is to the effect that the land is of 
agricultural use, barren and there is no development.  There is no specific 
denial that there were no demarcated plots.  It is also true that on the date 
of the acquisition there was no non-agricultural permission though the 
case of the appellant is he had taken preparatory steps and deposited the 
fees.           

51 
66.  In Administrator General of West Bengal (Supra) dealing with the 
aspect of valuing large tracts of land based on the price fetched for smaller 
plots, this Court held as under: 
“12. It is trite proposition that prices fetched for small plots cannot 
form safe bases for valuation of large tracts of land as the two are not 
comparable 
properties. 
(See Collector 
of 
Lakhimpur v. B.C. 
Dutta [(1972) 4 SCC 236] ; Mirza Nausherwan Khan v. Collector 
(Land Acquisition), Hyderabad [(1975) 1 SCC 238] ; Padma 
Uppal v. State of Punjab [(1977) 1 SCC 330] ; Smt Kaushalya Devi 
Bogra v. Land Acquisition Officer, Aurangabad [(1984) 2 SCC 324]  
The principle that evidence of market value of sales of small, 
developed plots is not a safe guide in valuing large extents of land 
has to be understood in its proper perspective. The principle requires 
that prices fetched for small developed plots cannot directly be 
adopted in valuing large extents. However, if it is shown that the 
large extent to be valued does not admit of and is ripe for use for 
building purposes; that building lots that could be laid out on the land 
would be good selling propositions and that valuation on the basis of 
the method of hypothetical lay out could with justification be 
adopted, then in valuing such small, laid out sites the valuation 
indicated by sale of comparable small sites in the area at or about the 
time of the notification would be relevant. In such a case, necessary 
deductions for the extent of land required for the formation of roads 
and other civil amenities; expenses of development of the sites by 
laying out roads, drains, sewers, water and electricity lines, and the 
interest on the outlays for the period of deferment of the realisation 
of the price; the profits on the venture etc. are to be made…. …”  
 
The appellant was claiming compensation @ Rs. 500 per sq. ft. and 
examined the valuer to substantiate the same which the Reference Court 
was not inclined to award and we agree with the Reference Court in that 

52 
regard.   We are also not awarding any amount for the 32% (approx.) of 
the land which, even according to the claimant, pertain to the area covered 
by roads and open space.  We are not inclined to award any compensation 
or damages.  Additionally for that reason also, we are not inclined to make 
any deductions from the market value fixed @ Rs. 100 per sq. ft. for the 
68.3% (approx.) of the land.  We have evidence to show that the land was 
ripe for use for building purposes. We are not inclined to, in the special 
facts and circumstances of the case, to order any deduction based on 
extent of land and the cost for incurring development.  The LAO in the 
award which in law is an offer, treated the appellant’s land and the land 
in Survey No. 7/2 (subject-matter of LAC No. 183/2000) on par and the 
Reference Court also treated them on par. 
67.  In this case since the acquisition is for construction of a flood 
protection wall, the question of there being any development or any cost 
thereof cannot arise. It is well settled that the purpose for which the land 
is acquired must be taken into consideration while determining 
development charges.    

53 
68.  In Himmat Singh & Ors. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. 
(2013) 16 SCC 392, this Court, dealing with the issue of deduction of 
development charges in the context of acquisition for a railway line held 
as under: 
“33. The approach adopted by the Reference Court and the High 
Court 
in 
making 
deductions 
towards 
the 
cost 
of 
development/development 
charges 
from 
the 
market 
value 
determined on the basis of the sale deeds produced by the appellants 
was clearly wrong. The respondents had not even suggested that the 
development envisaged by the Reference Court i.e. laying of roads, 
drains, sewer lines, parks, electricity lines, etc. or any other 
development work was required to be undertaken for laying the 
railway line. Therefore, 25% deduction made by the Reference Court 
and approved by the High Court under two different heads is legally 
unsustainable.” 
 
69.    Insofar as the Development charge is concerned, as held in 
Himmat Singh, where no Development is envisaged like laying of 
roads, drains, sewer lines, parks etc. and what is required is only 
construction of a flood control wall, the question of deducting any 
development charge cannot arise. [See also Nelson Fernandes vs. 
Land Acquisition Officer (2007) 9 SCC 447].   
70.  The VIDC has relied upon certain circulars to show the 
consequence of blue zone.  Since the finding is that no construction 

54 
area is limited to 15 meters from the boundary, the circulars do not 
carry the case of the State any further.  In any event, the State 
Government’s affidavit has clearly stated that what was in vogue in 
the relevant time was the Standardized Building Byelaws and 
Development Control Rules for B and C Class Municipal Councils 
of Maharashtra which was made applicable to even areas outside 
Municipal limits by Government resolution of 02.04.1974. The State 
does not in its affidavit make any reference to any applicable 
circular.  
71.   The appellant had averred that out of the total extent of 
125937.8 sq. ft., he had claimed @ Rs, 500/- per sq. ft. for 84481 sq. 
ft. which constitutes 68.3% (approx.) of the total extent.  The 
balance area of 41404 sq. ft. which constituted approximately 32%, 
according to him were the area covered by roads and open space.  
He had claimed Rs.25 lakhs for the extent of making the roads and 
also prayed for damages at Rs. 50 lakhs.   

55 
72.    In view of our judgment, the appellant will be entitled to 
Rs.100/- per sq. ft. for the 68.3% (approx.) of the balance area, after 
excluding the land area, if any, which falls within the 15 meters from 
the defined boundary of the water course. For the land falling within 
the no construction zone, if any, as per the Standardized Building 
Byelaws, he will be paid at the rate determined by the Special Land 
Acquisition Officer in the award.  Insofar as the market value of the 
land in question and other statutory benefits are concerned, the 
judgment of the Reference Court will continue to operate, subject to 
one modification.  The possession of the land in this case was taken 
on 15.11.1998 before the issuance of Section 4 notification. In 
another Appeal decided by us in this batch today, we have held the 
appellant entitled to rental compensation at the rate of 8% of the 
awarded amount for the period from 15.11.1998 to 04.08.2000, the 
date of the award. In view of the same, direction no. 5 in the 
operative order of the Reference Court requires to be modified. That 
direction was under Section 28 of the Act. In view of the entitlement 
for the rental income till 04.08.2000, the appellant shall be entitled 

56 
to interest on the enhanced amount at 9% for a period of one year 
from 04.08.2000 and at the rate of 15% for the period thereafter till 
payment of amount in the court. If the amount is already deposited, 
nothing further needs to be done.  If not, the State may pay the 
deficit, if any.  
73.  In view of our findings hereinabove, Civil Appeal Nos. 6776-
6777 of 2013 are partly allowed. The impugned judgment dated 
17.06.2013 in First Appeal No. 1210 of 2008 and First Appeal No. 
6 of 2009 are set aside and will stand superseded by our present 
judgment.  No order as to costs.   
II. Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 21611 of 2018 (Kazi 
Akiloddin Sujaoddin Vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors.)  
74.     Leave granted. 
75.   In this case, the facts are identical with Civil Appeal Nos. 6776-
6777 of 2013. The question involved is about the payment of rental 
compensation for the period from 15.11.1998 (when the possession 
of the appellant’s land was taken) to 04.08.2000 (when the award 
was passed by the Land Acquisition Officer). After the Reference 

57 
Court enhanced the compensation on 02.08.2008, the appellant and 
the State filed Appeals and cross Appeals in the High Court, namely, 
First Appeal No. 1210 of 2008 by the appellant and First Appeal No. 
6 of 2009 by the State. Pending the Appeal in the High Court, the 
appellant applied to the 3rd respondent herein, the Special Land 
Acquisition officer, for grant of rental compensation on the basis of 
enhanced compensation awarded by the Reference Court by its order 
dated 02.08.2008. Receiving no reply, the appellant filed Writ 
Petition No. 2763 of 2009 before the High Court. That Writ Petition 
was disposed off on 06.07.2009 by recording the statement of the 
Assistant Government Pleader that the application of the appellant 
would be decided on merits at the earliest.  
76.   Thereafter, on 05.10.2009, the application was rejected on the 
ground that order of the Reference Court was under challenge before 
the High Court.  
77.    Aggrieved, the appellant filed Writ Petition No. 3883 of 2010. 
By the judgment of 15.09.2011, Writ Petition No. 3883 of 2010 was 
allowed directing that enhanced rental compensation @ 8% of the 

58 
enhanced amount as directed to be paid by the Reference Court, be 
deposited in the High Court. It further directed that the appellant 
could withdraw half the amount by furnishing the security and 
remaining amount to be kept in fixed deposit. It is undisputed that 
8% was calculated for the period 15.11.1998 till the date of award 
i.e. 04.08.2000.  
78.   The State Government did not challenge the order dated 
15.09.2011 
which 
determined 
the 
entitlement 
for 
rental 
compensation from 15.11.1998 (the date of taking advance 
possession) till 04.08.2000 (date of the award). The appellant, 
aggrieved by the judgment of 15.09.2011 in Writ Petition 3883 of 
2010, filed Civil Appeal No. 5084 of 2013 before this Court which 
was disposed off on 3rd July, 2013, directing that in case 
compensation is enhanced, the appellant shall be entitled for the 
rental compensation as per the enhanced amount. It did not interfere 
with the order of the High Court directing the State Government to 
deposit the rental compensation @ of 8% of the amount awarded by 
the Reference Court with the Appellate Court and allowing the 

59 
appellant to withdraw only half the amount. Liberty was also 
reserved to the appellant to claim proportionate higher rental 
compensation, if the order of the Reference Court is upheld or further 
enhancement of compensation is made by the Appellate Court. So 
holding, the Appeal of the appellant was dismissed.  
79.    What is significant is that this Court by its judgment referred 
to above of 3rd July, 2013 in Civil Appeal No. 5084 of 2013 [Kazi 
Akiloddin Sujaoddin Vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors.] reported in 
(2013) 14 SCC 8, in the absence of any appeal by the State had no 
occasion to disturb the mandamus issued in Writ Petition 3883 of 
2010 by the High Court, insofar as it fixed the entitlement to the 
rental compensation for the period 15.11.1998 till 04.08.2000. 
Hence, the State cannot challenge the period for which the appellant 
was entitled to rental compensation, in these proceedings.  The rental 
compensation and the period were based on the Government 
Resolutions dated 02.05.1961, 01.12.1972, 02.04.1979 and 
24.03.1998. 

60 
80.     Hence, the appellant is entitled for the rental compensation for 
the period 15.11.1998 till 04.08.2000 on the basis of 8% of the 
awarded amount as decided by us today in Civil Appeal Nos. 6776-
6777 of 2013 by this very judgment. The Civil Appeal is allowed in 
the above terms and the impugned judgment in Writ Petition No. 
4062 of 2018 dated 10.07.2018 stands superseded by the present 
judgment. No order as to costs.    
III.    Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6490 of 2022 (Sau. 
Dwarkabai Vs. The State of Maharashtra & Anr.) 
81.     Leave granted. 
82.   The present Appeal arises from the judgment of the High Court 
of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, Nagpur in First Appeal No. 
896 of 2016 dated 18.02.2021. The facts are as follows. Section 4(1) 
notification under the Act was published on 11.03.1999. The land of 
the appellant situated in Field Gut No. 4/2 admeasuring 0.86 
Hectares i.e. 2 acres and 6 Gunthas at village Hingana Mhaispur, Tq. 
& District Akola (Maharashtra) was sought to be acquired by the 
respondents for the purpose of construction of a flood protection wall 

61 
for Akola city. Thereafter, on 22.06.2000, award was passed 
awarding a total compensation of Rs. 56,588/- per hectare. On a 
reference being made under Section 18 of the Act, the appellant 
claimed higher compensation. Four witnesses were examined on the 
side of the appellant.  The appellant examined himself as PW-1.  A 
map was produced by him to show that the surrounding area was 
completely non-agricultural and developed.  Three certified copies 
of sale deeds, one of which is a post-notification deed was also 
produced.  A list pertaining to plots sold in Survey Nos. 7/1 and 7/2 
of Akola Bujurg was also produced.  The appellant contended that 
the situation of the land was in a developed area adjoining to 
Ramakrishna Vivekanand Vikri Kendra, Maratha Sewa Sangh, 
Vyankatesh Restaurant, Agricultural Produce Market Committee 
etc.  Strangely, the State did not subject the appellant to any cross-
examination.   
83.    The appellant examined two Talathies of the village, namely, 
Sudhakar Namdeorao Ambuskar (PW-3) and Bhagwan Shamrao 
Thite (PW-4).  PW-3 marked the sketch of Hingana Mhaispur to 

62 
establish that towards the north of the property is a cart track and 
towards the south of the cart track is the boundary of village Akoli.  
In the cross-examination, he deposed that Survey No.4 was adjacent 
to the river and since there was a possibility of proceeding of water 
only, it was not useful for non-agricultural purpose.  To the similar 
effect is the evidence of PW-4.     
84.  The respondents did not adduce any evidence. The Reference 
Court awarded Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. Para 9, 10 and 11 of the order of 
the Reference Court are extracted herein below: 
“9. The acquired land physical situation is supported by oral 
evidence of P.W. Nos.3 and 4, who are Talathi and concern with 
the said landed portion. Both these witnesses have proved the 
vicinity of the landed portion, which is acquired. Not only the oral 
evidence of P.W. Nos.3 and 4 support to the vicinity of landed 
portion allegedly contended by the petitioner, but it is also 
supported to the blue-print map, which is available on record and 
other maps also available, which are drawn by the revenue 
authorities itself. There are two maps filed on record. One is of 
Akoli Kd. and another is of Hingana Mhaispur. These two lands 
appears to be accessible and fetchable for the residential purposes 
before the time of notification. There is no any rebuttable evidence 
regarding the physical status of landed area in question and 
objection raised by respondent in their written statement. 
 
10. It is exfacie proved on the basis of sale-deeds, maps, oral 
evidence in support of petitioner's case that the landed zone of 

63 
Akoli Kd. and Hingana Mhaispur having concern with the 
residential zone, and therefore, there are so many possibilities of 
high escalation in market value that too, since the time of 
notification. 
 
11. ...On the basis of materials on record and the oral evidence 
supported to the case, the petitioner's case for enhancement of the 
compensation appears to be well founded. Not only this, petitioner 
has 
supported 
with 
the 
relevant 
judgment 
passed 
in 
L.A.C.No.183/2000 dated 15/01/2005. Certified copy is on record, 
which clearly shows the fetchable prevailing rate as per market 
valuation of the concern land was Rs.100/- per square feet. This 
rate cannot be remained constant. In the present circumstances, 
there must be escalation in the market valuation. Considering this 
fact, petitioner did not make any amendment in his pleading. At 
the stage of argument vide written argument Exh.48 on Page No.8 
of it, claiming the enhanced compensation at the rate of Rs.100/-, 
that found me justifiable and natural and supported with all 
backgrounds about market valuation.” 
 
Other statutory benefits were also awarded. 
 
85.  Aggrieved by the order of the Reference Court, the State 
preferred First Appeal No. 896 of 2016 before the High Court. The 
State contended that reliance placed by the Reference Court on LAC 
No. 183/2000 was not justified as the judgment in the said LAC No. 
183/2000 was pending Appeal in the High Court; that the land that 
was subject matter of LAC No. 183/2000 was located in a different 

64 
village and the land was not similar in nature; that the judgment in 
LAC No. 183/2000 has been mechanically relied upon without 
considering its applicability to the case at hand; that the sale deeds 
relied upon related to small non-agricultural plots which had 
construction potentiality and are not comparable instances. The State 
further argued that in another First Appeal No. 1210 of 2008 arising 
from LAC No. 140/2000 (subject matter of the Appeal in Civil 
Appeal Nos. 6776-6777 of 2013 herein), the Appeal of the State was 
allowed and the compensation fixed at Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. was set 
aside and the compensation fixed by the Land Acquisition Officer at 
Rs. 5.30/- per sq. ft. was restored. 
86.  Mr. Nishant Katneshwarkar, learned counsel for the appellant 
contended that though the land is situated in Village Hingana 
Mhaispur, the said village is separated from Village Akoli (Bk) only 
by a bullock-cart track; that civic amenities were available in and 
around the acquired land; that the land had construction potentiality; 
that the judgment in LAC No.183/2000 was not the only basis and 
that sale deeds dated 04.05.1999 (Exh.40), 11.06.1998 (Exh.41) and 

65 
15.07.1998 (Exh.42) were relied upon which showed that the land 
located in the same vicinity was sold @ of Rs. 110/- per sq. ft., Rs. 
60/- per sq. ft. and Rs. 50/- per sq. ft. It was also submitted that there 
was no evidence to show that the land was along the riverbank and 
was prone to flooding. It was also submitted that the judgment in 
First Appeal No. 1210 of 2008 (subject matter in Civil Appeal 
Nos.6776-6777 of 2013 herein) had not attained finality. 
87.    The High Court, in the impugned order, proceeded as if the 
only basis of the judgment of the Reference Court was the order in 
LAC No. 183/2000. That is clear from the reading of para 8 of the 
impugned order which states that “the Reference Court has 
determined the market rate of the acquired land on the basis of the 
judgment in LAC No.183/2000.” This may not be entirely an accurate 
statement as a careful perusal of the portions of the Reference Court 
judgment extracted herein above indicates that the order in LAC No. 
183/2000 was an additional factor. Be that as it may, the High Court 
held that the land in LAC No. 183/2000 pertained to a small plot, 
namely, Survey No. 7/2 which was converted to non-agricultural use 

66 
way back in the year 1982. It was also found that unlike the present 
plot, the land that was subject matter in LAC No. 183/2000 was not 
on the riverbank. The High Court found that the sale deed of 
04.05.1999 (Exh.40) was a post notification transaction. As far as the 
sale deeds dated 11.06.1998 (Exh.41) and 15.07.1998 (Exh.42) are 
concerned, the High Court held that they pertained to plot nos. 117, 
162 and 12 respectively carved out from Survey Nos. 6, 7 and 60 of 
village Akoli (Khurd) which was converted to non-agricultural land 
way back in the year 1982. Thereafter, the High Court held as 
follows:  
“11. The Respondent had also relied upon the sale-deed dated 
04/05/1999 at Exh.40, which is a post notification transaction. 
The said sale-deed as well as sale-deeds dated 11/06/1998 at 
Exh.41 and 15/07/1998 at Exh. 42 relate to plot Nos.117, 162 
and 12 respectively carved out from Survey No.6, 7 and 60 of 
village Akoli (khurd), which was converted to non-agricultural 
land way back in the year 1982. These sale-deed plots were sold 
at the rate of Rs. 50-60 per sq.ft. It is not in dispute that these 
sale-deed plots are situated in village Akoli khurd which is 
separate from village Hingana by a bullock cart track. These 
sale-deed plots were small in size and were suitable for 
construction purpose. Moreover, these sale-deed plots were 
away from the river bank and were not prone to getting 
submerged during rainy season or floods. 
 
12. As compared to the sale-deed land, the acquired land is a 
vast track of agricultural land, along the river bank and was 

67 
prone to getting inundated during rainy season and hence was 
not suitable for construction purpose. On account of these 
dissimilarities, the acquired land would not have fetched the 
same price as that of the sale-deed land. The above stated 
disadvantageous factors possessed by the acquired land would 
warrant appropriate deductions. 
 
13. The above referred sale-deed plots were sold in the year 
1998 at the rate of Rs. 50-60 per sq.ft.. Considering the fact that 
the notification under Section 4 is of the year 1999, and further 
considering increase in the price of land at 10% per annum, the 
rate of these developed plots can be considered at Rs.60/- per 
sq.ft. upon deducting 30% towards development charges, 30% 
towards the difference in area and 15% in view of 
disadvantageous location of the acquired land vis-a-vis the sale-
deed land, the price works out to Rs.15/- per sq. ft.”  
 
So holding, the compensation was fixed at Rs. 15/- per sq. ft. The 
High Court not only deducted 30% towards development charges, 
which we find is unjustified, it further went on to deduct 30% 
towards the difference in area and 15% in view of the 
disadvantageous location.  
88.     We notice that the State is not in the Appeal in this matter and 
there is no dispute about the applicability of the exemplars Exh.41 
dated 11.06.1998 and Exh.42 dated 15.07.1998 to determine the base 
value.  We also note that the appellant’s own witness PW 3 and 4 

68 
deposed in cross-examination that the land could not be put to non-
agricultural use. The appellant did not re-examine them.  
89.    While we do not fault the judgment of the High Court in fixing 
Rs. 60/- per sq. ft and applying 30% towards difference in area, we 
feel that further deduction towards development charges while the 
acquisition was for the construction of the wall involving no 
development and further 15% due to disadvantageous location was 
completely unjustified. Hence, we award the compensation for the 
land in question in this Appeal @ of Rs. 42/- per sq. ft. The Rest of 
the order with regard to the statutory benefits and interest is 
maintained. We are conscious that the amount of Rs. 42 per sq. ft. 
awarded by us is above the amount claimed.  
90.        In the affidavit-in-chief of the appellant, there is a poignant 
averment to the following effect “…. But as I could not be able to 
arrange for the Court fee, I have claimed the price of the land @ Rs. 
30/- per sq. ft. which comes to Rs.19,35,000/-.  The Land Acquisition 
Officer paid Rs. 56,585/- towards the value of the land and hence I 
am claiming Rs.18,78,450/- towards the balance market value of the 

69 
land along with all other benefits, interest and solatium and also give 
other benefits given to landless persons.  I have no land on my own 
now.”  
91.   We are supported in this course of action by the earlier 
judgments of this Court in Bhag Singh and Others vs. Union 
Territory of Chandigarh through the Land Acquisition Collector, 
Chandigarh, (1985) 3 SCC 737 where Chief Justice Bhagwati held 
while tempering law with justice:-  
“3… The learned Single Judge and the Division Bench should 
not have, in our opinion, adopted a technical approach and 
denied the benefit of enhanced compensation to the appellants 
merely because they had not initially paid the proper amount of 
court fee. It must be remembered that this was not a dispute 
between two private citizens where it would be quite just and 
legitimate to confine the claimant to the claim made by him and 
not to award him any higher amount than that claimed though 
even in such a case there may be situations where an amount 
higher than that claimed can be awarded to the claimant as for 
instance where an amount is claimed as due at the foot of an 
account. Here was a claim made by the appellants against the 
State Government for compensation for acquisition of their land 
and under the law, the State was bound to pay to the appellants 
compensation on the basis of the market value of the land 
acquired and if according to the judgments of the learned Single 
Judge and the Division Bench, the market value of the land 
acquired was higher than that awarded by the Land Acquisition 
Collector or the Additional District Judge, there is no reason 
why the appellants should have been denied the benefit of 
payment of the market value so determined. To deny this benefit 

70 
to the appellants would tantamount to permitting the State 
Government to acquire the land of the appellants on payment of 
less than the true market value. There may be cases where, as 
for instance, under agrarian reform legislation, the holder of 
land may, legitimately, as a matter of social justice, with a view 
to eliminating concentration of land in the hands of a few and 
bringing about its equitable distribution, be deprived of land 
which is not being personally cultivated by him or which is in 
excess of the ceiling area with payment of little compensation 
or no compensation at all, but where land is acquired under the 
Land Acquisition Act, 1894, it would not be fair and just to 
deprive the holder of his land without payment of the true 
market value when the law, in so many terms, declares that he 
shall be paid such market value. The State Government must do 
what is fair and just to the citizen and should not, as far as 
possible, except in cases where tax or revenue is received or 
recovered without protest or where the State Government would 
otherwise be irretrievably be prejudiced, take up a technical plea 
to defeat the legitimate and just claim of the citizen. We are, 
therefore, of the view that, in the present case, the Division 
Bench as well as the learned Single Judge should have allowed 
the appellants to pay up the deficit court fee and awarded to 
them compensation at the higher rate or rates determined by 
them.” 
 
The said principle has been followed in other cases including in 
Ashok Kumar and Another vs. State of Haryana, (2016) 4 SCC 544 
wherein para 7 it was held as under: - 
“7. The pre-amended provision puts a cap on the maximum : the 
compensation by court should not be beyond the amount 
claimed. The amendment in 1984, on the contrary, puts a cap on 
the minimum : compensation cannot be less than what was 
awarded by the Land Acquisition Collector. The cap on 
maximum having been expressly omitted, and the cap that is put 
is only on minimum, it is clear that the amount of compensation 

71 
that a court can award is no longer restricted to the amount 
claimed by the applicant. It is the duty of the court to award just 
and fair compensation taking into consideration the true market 
value and other relevant factors, irrespective of the claim made 
by the owner.  
 
92.   The above are classic instances where this Court ensured that 
justice and fairness triumphed over technicalities.  By the said 
course, it is ensured that a balance was struck between recognizing 
the right of the State in exercising its power of eminent domain with 
the right of the citizen to receive what was legally due.  In accordance 
with the above judgment, we also direct that the deficit court fee 
which will now become payable when compensation is awarded @ 
of Rs. 42/- per sq. ft along with other statutory benefits shall be 
payable by the appellant.  
93.  The Civil Appeal is allowed in the above terms and the 
impugned judgment dated 18.02.2021 in First Appeal No. 896 of 
2016 stands set aside and will be superseded by the present judgment 
insofar as fixing the market value is concerned.  All statutory and 

72 
other benefits as ordered by the Reference Court shall continue to 
operate.  No order as to costs. 
IV. Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6817 of 2023 (Smt. 
Vijayadevi Navalkishore Bhartia & Ors. Vs. State of 
Maharashtra & Anr.) and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) 
No. 2324 of 2023 (The Executive Engineer Vs. Smt. Vijayadevi 
Navalkishore Bhartia & Ors.)   
94.    Leave granted in both the matters. 
95.   Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) 6817 of 2023 is filed by the 
family of landowners aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court 
of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, Nagpur in First Appeal No. 
643 of 2006 dated 27.09.2022.  Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) 
2324 of 2023 is filed by the State against the dismissal of their First 
Appeal No. 541 of 2007 by the same judgment dated 27.09.2022. By 
virtue of the said judgment, the High Court confirmed the judgment 
of the Ld. Ad-hoc Additional District Judge, Akola awarding 
compensation @ of Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. for the plot area admeasuring 
359684.44 sq. ft., further @ of Rs. 50/-per sq. ft. for open belt area 

73 
admeasuring 108501.12 sq. ft. and @ of Rs. 25/- per sq. ft. for the 
plot area created due to division admeasuring 28809.84 sq. ft. with 
consequential benefits.  
A. Brief Facts: 
96.    Brief facts giving rise to the case are as follows. The lands of 
the claimants are situated in Survey Nos. 6, 7 and 60 at Mauza Akoli 
Khurd district Akola. According to the appellants, on 03.03.1983 the 
land was converted to non-agricultural use. Survey No. 7 was 
reserved for development of residential tenements by the Nagpur 
Housing and Area Development Board vide gazette notification 
dated 11.10.1984. A notification under Section 4 of the Act was 
issued on 03.06.1999 for acquiring the land for construction of flood 
protection wall. On 06.10.1999, notice under Section 6 of the Act 
was published. On 09.04.2001, an award was passed @ of Rs. 
72,400/- per hectare. The appellants have a case that originally the 
award was proposed for higher amount but the same was re-
evaluated and reduced ultimately in the final award of 09.04.2001. 
This issue need not detain the Court as ultimately there is no dispute 

74 
that the amount as awarded by the Land Acquisition Officer was Rs. 
72,400/- per hectare. In fairness to the claimant owners, no serious 
argument in this Court was even canvassed. In fact, a Writ Petition 
was filed, namely, Writ Petition No. 753 of 2003 challenging the 
decision of the Commissioner in reducing the compensation. That 
Writ Petition was dismissed and in Civil Appeal No. 2045 of 2003 
filed in this Court, an order was made on 12.02.2004. By the said 
order, the claimant owners were asked to raise all the issues before 
the Reference Court.  
97.    In the meantime, on 13.05.2002, aggrieved by the award passed 
by the Land Acquisition Officer, the appellants filed reference 
application bearing LAC No. 209 of 2002. Evidence was adduced 
about the situs of the land and a claim was made that compensation 
should be awarded @ of Rs. 175/- per sq. ft. Primarily, four sale 
deeds were relied upon being (i) Exh.75 dated 12.02.1999 pertaining 
to plot no. 78 of Akoli (Bk) from Survey Nos. 8 and 5/1. The total 
area of the plot was 1500 sq. ft. and it was sold @ of Rs. 100/- per 
sq. ft. (ii) Exh.76 dated 04.05.1999 pertained to plot no. 58 from 

75 
Survey Nos. 6, 7 and 60 of Akoli (Kh) and it was sold @ of Rs. 100/- 
per sq. ft. (iii) Exh.77 dated 04.05.1999 was in respect of plot no. 
117 from Survey Nos. 6, 7 where the plot wasa sold at Rs. 110/- per 
sq. ft. and (iv) Exh. 78 is the sale deed of Plot No. 50 dated 
11.05.1999 from Survey No. 7/2 of Akoli (Kh) and it was sold @ of 
Rs. 175/- per sq. ft. 
98.   The main case of the claimant owners is that compensation 
should have been awarded based on the sale deed of 11.05.1999 
which pertained to plot No. 50 from Survey no. 7/2 of Akoli (Bk) 
where the price was Rs. 175/- per sq. ft.  
99.   By the judgment of 10.08.2006, the Reference Court awarded 
enhanced compensation. For the plot area admeasuring 359684.44 a 
sum of Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. was awarded. For area under open belt 
admeasuring 108501.12 sq. ft. enhanced compensation at Rs. 50 per 
sq. ft. was awarded. For the balance area of divided plots 
admeasuring 28809.84 sq. ft., Rs. 25/- per sq. ft. was awarded.  
100.  This judgment dated 10.08.2006 was challenged by filing First 
Appeal No. 643 of 2006 by the claimant owners and the First Appeal 

76 
No. 541 of 2007 by the State. The High Court by the impugned 
judgment has affirmed the findings of the Reference Court. The 
appellants and the State are in Appeal.  
B. Contentions: 
101.   Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned  senior counsel for the appellants 
contended that land was developed non-agricultural land converted 
to non-agricultural use on 03.03.1983; that the area around the land 
is fully developed and is abutting the road leading to national 
highway at 1 km; that roads are available; development works were 
going on and that the land did not fall under ‘Blue Zone’ and in any 
case the said contention was given up by the State insofar as the 
appellant’s land was concerned. The learned senior counsel further 
contended that the highest exemplar at Rs. 175/- per sq. ft. ought to 
have been taken and the stand that the sale was between the related 
parties ought to be rejected since there was no evidence to show that 
the sale was intended to obtain higher compensation. Additionally, 
the sale was in favour of the legal entity. The learned counsel relied 
upon the judgments in Munusamy v. Land Acquisition Officer, 

77 
(2021) 13 SCC 258 and Mehrawal Khewaji Trust (Registered), 
Faridkot and Others v. State of Punjab and Others, (2012) 5 SCC 
432 to contend that Exh. 78 the sale dated 11.05.1999 of plot no. 50 
in Survey No. 7/2 of Akoli (bk) should have been taken being the 
highest exemplar. The learned senior counsel also submits that no 
deduction for development charges ought to have been made. 
According to learned counsel, since it is for the construction of a 
flood wall no development is required and in any event no 
compensation has been awarded for the portions of the land 
consisting of roads, lanes and open space. Learned counsel relied on 
Bhagwathula Samanna and Others Vs. Special Tahsildar and 
Land 
Acquisition 
Officer, 
Visakhapatnam 
Municipality, 
Visakhapatnam, (1991) 4 SCC 506; Charan Dass (Dead) by LRs. 
Vs. H.P. Housing & Urban Development Authority & Ors., (2010) 
13 SCC 398 and State of M.P. vs. Radheshyam, 2022 SCC OnLine 
SC 162.  
102.   Rebutting the arguments, Shri Uday B. Dube, learned counsel 
for the Vidharbha Industrial Development Corporation (hereinafter 

78 
referred to as ‘VIDC’) contends that of the four sale deeds, Exh.75 
dated 12.02.1999 was a transaction between unrelated parties. The 
other three Exh.76, Exh.77 and Exh.78 were also executed just prior 
to the issuance of the Section 4 notification and were between the 
related parties. The sale deeds were executed just prior to the 
initiation of the acquisition and according to the State, the parties had 
full knowledge regarding sanction of the project for construction of 
flood control wall and as such sale deeds are suspicious in nature and 
are intended only for the purpose of getting more compensation for 
the plots which could not be sold for 15 to 16 long years. The State 
relied upon State of Maharashtra and Others Vs. Digamber 
Bhimashankar Tandale & Ors. (1996) 2 SCC 583 to contend that 
though the lands were converted for non-agricultural purpose, there 
was no development and hence compensation on per sq. ft. basis 
could not have been awarded. According to the State, the claimant 
owners were not available to sell a single plot for 15 to 16 long years.  
103.     It is further contended that the land extend to more than 7 lac 
sq. ft. in all the matters pertaining to the family and as such 

79 
compensation at Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. relying on an exemplar sale deed 
involving sale of an area measuring 1500 sq. ft. was not justified.  
104.    The State vehemently argues that the intra family sale deed 
Exh. 78 dated 11.05.1999 executed just twenty-three days prior to 
the notification under Section 4 cannot be the basis for the award of 
compensation @ of Rs. 175/- per sq. ft. In fact, the claimants prayed 
only for an average compensation of Rs. 121.25/- per sq. ft. So 
praying, the State prayed for restoration of the award passed by Land 
Acquisition Officer.  
C. Findings of the High Court: 
105.   The High Court in the impugned order has found that the land 
was reserved for development of residential tenements. It relied on 
Exh. 67 a notification dated 21.09.1984 published in the Government 
Gazette. In fact, the High Court records that the witness for the 
respondent-State had not countered this fact that the document was 
produced and the document had remained unrebutted. Dealing with 
the argument of the claimants/land owners that the Commissioner 
could not sit in appeal against the proposed award, the High Court 

80 
rightly rejected the plea stating that in the reference proceedings all 
the issues have been raised and as such no prejudice has been caused 
to the claimant land owners. Dealing with the situs of the land, the 
High Court recognized the fact that the land was in close proximity 
to the various institutions of prominence in Akola City. It recorded 
the following finding:  
“20.  ….It is to be noted that in the award passed by the SLAO, 
a reference has been made to the prominent location of the 
acquired land. The distance of the acquired land from various 
institutions of prominence and the close proximity of the land 
to Akola city has been mentioned. It has been proved that on the 
Northern side of the acquired land, there are police quarters 
known as Rahat Nagar, Sneh Nagar and to the North-west, there 
is Ambedkar Nagar, Vijay Oil Industries and Krushi Utpanna 
Bazar Samiti market. So also, near the acquired land, there are 
Ramkrushna Vivekanand Ashram, Maa Sharda Balak Mandir, 
Ramkrushna Vivekanand Sahitya Kharedi Vikri Kendra and 
Saint Anne's School of Hyderabad etc. It has been proved that 
temple of Lord Vyankatesh Balaji, Maratha Seva Sangh, Swami 
Vivekanand High School, Jijau Vasatigruha. Vyankatesh 
Restaurant, Wholesale Grain Merchant's Housing and 
Commercial Complex Society and Alankar Petrol Pump, are 
located in the close proximity of the acquired land. 
 
21. PW2 Brijmohan Modi, a registered valuer, examined by the 
claimants has proved the Valuation Reports at Exhs.63 and 64. 
The map drawn by the valuer is at Exh.83. On the basis of the 
evidence of PW1 and PW2, prominent location of the acquired 
land in close proximity of Akola city has been proved. It has 

81 
been proved that in the vicinity of the acquired land, there has 
been development. There are residential and commercial 
complexes. Evidence adduced in rebuttal by the respondents is 
not sufficient to disprove the above aspects. The only statement 
reiterated time and again by the respondents is that the acquired 
land being situated on the bank of Morna river, it had no future 
prospects of development. In our opinion, this contention of the 
respondents cannot be accepted in view of the positive evidence 
adduced by the claimants. Learned Presiding Officer of the 
Reference Court has accepted this evidence. We do not see any 
reason to discard or disbelieve this evidence.” 
 
106.   Analysing Exh. 75 to Exh. 78 relied upon by the Appellants, 
the High Court observed as follows: 
23. In order to prove that the market price of the land on the date 
of Section 4 notification was not less than Rs.200/- per sq.ft., 
the claimants have placed on record four sale instances at 
Exhibits-75 to 78. Exh.75 is the sale deed dated 12.02.1999 of 
plot no.78 of Akoli (Bk.) from survey nos. 8 and 5/1. Total area 
of the plot was 1500 sq.ft. It was sold @ Rs.l00/- per sq.ft. It has 
come on record that this plot was sold by one Usha Santoshrao 
Gole to Ashok Krushnarao Sapkal and Shalikram Ramkrushna 
Zamre. It is to be noted that this sale transaction has been made 
the basis for quantifying the enhanced compensation by the 
learned Presiding Officer of the Reference Court. The vendor 
and vendee are not concerned with the claimants in any manner. 
In our opinion, therefore, the contention of the respondents that 
this sale instance was brought into existence to claim excessive 
and exorbitant compensation by the claimants cannot be 
accepted. On a perusal of the oral evidence adduced by the 
claimants and supporting documentary evidence, we do not see 
any reason to discard and disbelieve this sale instance.” 

82 
 
107.    Hence, the High Court ultimately confirmed the order of the 
Reference Court relying upon Exh. 75 sale deed dated 12.02.1999 
for Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. It expressly recorded that the vendor and 
vendee were not concerned with the claimants in any manner and 
that was also the admitted case of the State. Rejecting Exh. 76, Exh. 
77 and Exh. 78, the High Court recorded that the sale deeds were 
executed by members of the family and as such it did not chose to 
rely upon the same.  
Findings: 
108.  We have already in this judgment while dealing with Civil 
Appeal Nos. 6776-6777 of 2013 hereinabove, discussed the 
correctness of the judgment and order in LAC No. 209 of 2002, 
which reference concerned the present appellants. We have also 
discussed the law on reliance of exemplars of unrelated parties and 
related parties and as to how when there are two exemplars, one 
between unrelated parties at arm’s length and the other between 
related parties mentioning a higher value and when both are within 

83 
reasonable time gap, prudence would dictate and common sense 
would command the acceptability of the exemplars involving 
unrelated parties.  The same reasoning applies here also.  
109.   We have also therein discussed the law on the applicability of 
the development charges and also dealt therein the aspect of in what 
circumstances the value fetched by smaller plots can be applied in 
valuing larger tracts of land.  Additionally, it has also to be borne in 
mind that while Rs.100/- per sq. ft. was awarded by the Reference 
Court for plotted area admeasuring 359684.44 sq. ft., for the open 
belt area admeasuring 108501.12 sq. ft., the enhanced compensation 
was only @ Rs. 50/- per sq. ft.  Additionally, for the plot area created 
due to division admeasuring 28809.84 per sq. ft., the enhanced 
compensation was @ Rs. 25/- per sq. ft.  For this reason also, 
additionally, we are not inclined to make any deduction in the 
amount of Rs.100/- per sq. ft. awarded for the plot area admeasuring 
359684.44 sq. ft.   In view of the above, both the Civil Appeals are 
dismissed.  No order as to costs. 
 

84 
V. Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6819 of 2023 
(Vijayadevi Navalkishore Bhartia & Ors. vs. The State of 
Maharashtra & Anr.) and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) 
No. 2892 of 2023 (The Executive Engineer Vs. Smt. Vijayadevi 
Navalkishore Bhartia & Ors.)   
110.    Leave granted in both the matters. 
111. These Appeals are similar to Civil Appeal arising out of SLP 
(C) 2324 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6817 
of 2023. The only difference being that the land is situated in Survey 
No. 6 and Survey No. 7 in Akoli (kd) and measures 26016.59 sq. ft. 
Section 4 notification under the Act was dated 21.07.2000; and 
Section 6 notification of the Act was dated 02.02.2001. The Special 
Land Acquisition Officer published the award on 27.06.2002 @ of 
Rs. 96364/- per hectare. On 20.04.2006, the Reference Court allowed 
LAC No. 53/2005 and granted Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. The High Court 
has dismissed the First Appeal No. 384/2006 filed by the claimant 
and First Appeal No. 621/2006 filed by the respondents. Both parties 
have relied on the arguments raised in Civil Appeal arising out of 

85 
SLP (C) No. 2324 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) 
No. 6817 of 2023 and as such whatever has been held therein holds 
good for these Appeals also. In view of the above, both the Civil 
Appeals are dismissed.  No order as to costs.   
VI. Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6820 of 2023 (Smt. 
Taradevi Chimanlalji Bhartia & Ors. Vs.  The State of 
Maharashtra & Anr.) and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) 
No. 2753 of 2023 (The Executive Engineer Vs. Smt. Taradevi 
Chimanlalji Bhartia & Ors.)    
112.   Leave granted in both the matters. 
113.  The claimants filed First Appeal No. 282 of 2005 and the State 
filed First Appeal No. 155 of 2005 arising out of LAC No. 183/2000. 
The facts are same as in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 
6817 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 2324 of 
2023. The slight difference being the area involved i.e. plot area of 
15562 sq. ft. and open sub divided area of 9464 sq. ft. On 03.06.1999, 
Section 4 notification under the Act was issued and Section 6 
notification under the Act was issued on 02.12.1999. On 04.08.2000, 

86 
the LAO made award @ of Rs. 5,61,000/- per hectare. On a reference 
being filed, the Reference Court in LAC No. 183/2000 awarded 
compensation @ of Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. Both the claimants and the 
State filed Appeals. We have already in this judgment affirmed the 
findings in LAC No. 183/2002 out of which these Appeals arise. By 
the impugned order, the High Court confirmed the order of the 
Reference Court. Arguments are similar, hence, whatever has been 
held in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6817 of 2023 and 
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 2324 of 2023 would hold 
good for these Appeals also. In view of the above, the Civil Appeals 
of the appellant landowners as well as the acquiring body are 
dismissed.  No order as to costs.
