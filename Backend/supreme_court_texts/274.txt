2.
The brief facts leading to this appeal are that in the year 2012
Respondent No.2-complainant placed a purchase order for the supply
of  “Promotec  Fiber  Laser  Cutting  Machine” to  the  company  (M/s
Farmax) of the appellant. For the said purchase, an advance amount
of Rs.1,55,00,000 was paid to the company of the appellant. All the
same, for some reasons, M/s Farmax failed to procure and supply this
machine  to  respondent  No.2-complainant.  Thereafter,  the  appellant
issued 5 cheques to the complainant towards return of the advance
money. Admittedly, some of these cheques were dishonoured and in
Nov-Dec 2013 the  complainant initiated proceedings under section
138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (hereinafter referred to as “NI
Act”). Additionally,  in January  2014  complainant filed  a  complaint
under Section 156(3) of Criminal Procedure Code (hereinafter referred
to as ‘CrPC’) which  led  to  an FIR No.35  of  2014  at  Police Station

Mahesh Nagar (Ambala) under Sections 406, 420 and 120B of Indian
Penal  Code  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  ‘IPC’)  against  the  appellant,
wherein it was said that the appellant had wrongfully retained the
hard-earned  money  of  the  complainant  and  had  cheated  her.  The
charge sheet dated 21.07.2014 under Sections 406, 420 r/w 120B of
IPC was filed against the appellant and trial commenced in the said
FIR case.
3.
In  NI  Act  case,  the  trial  court  vide  order  dated
25.05.2015/29.05.2015 convicted the appellant under Section 138 of
the NI Act and sentenced him to 2 years of rigorous imprisonment
along with direction to pay the amount of cheques. In the appeal filed
by appellant before the Additional Sessions Judge, both sides made an
effort to settle the dispute and consequently the matter was placed
before  the  Lok  Adalat,  where  after  negotiations,  parties  reached  a
settlement.   Consequently,  the  Additional  Session  Judge,  Pre-Lok
Adalat, Amabala passed the settlement order dated 05.12.2015 where
the appellant agreed to pay back the entire amount of Rs.1.55 crore,
which was to be paid within a period of about 16 months.  Once the
entire amount was paid, the entire proceedings under Section 138 of
NI Act as well as offences under Section 406, 420 read with 120B of
IPC arising out of the FIR had to be compounded.  This was also
2

mentioned  in  the  settlement  order  dated  05.12.2015,  the  relevant
portion of the said order is reproduced below: 
“That  if  appellant  shall  pay  entire  amount  as  per
settlement, then the offence u/s 138 of NI Act shall be
compounded and FIR bearing No.35 of 2014 u/s 420,
406, 120-B, PS Mahesh Nagar, Ambala Cantt. shall be
treated either as quashed or offences shall be treated
as compounded.”
However, the appellant could not discharge his liability in terms of the
settlement and the Additional Sessions Judge passed an order dated
11.07.2016  holding  that  the  settlement  dated  05.12.2015  stood
frustrated. 
4.
During  2016-2020,  appellant  approached  various  courts
including this Court seeking an extension of time to pay back the
amount and meanwhile a substantial amount has been paid to the
complainant. Finally, this matter came before this Court in SLP(Crl)
No.10560 of 2019 filed by the appellant’s wife and this court vide
order dated 29.11.2019 passed an order directing the appellant’s wife
to deposit Rs.20 lacs before the trial court within three weeks as only
Rs.20 lacs was the outstanding amount out of the total amount of
Rs.1.55 crore at that relevant time. Appellant’s wife failed to comply
with this Court’s order dated 29.11.2019 and that SLP was dismissed
vide order dated 14.02.2020.
5.
Thereafter,  the  appellant  approached  the  trial  court  and
3

presented a Demand Draft dated 12.02.2020 of Rs.20 lacs in favour of
the complainant as repayment towards the remaining amount of Rs.20
lacs.  In  this  application,  the  appellant  prayed  that  criminal
proceedings pending against the appellant, initiated on the instance of
the complainant, should either be compounded or quashed. However,
considering the submission of counsel of the complainant that SLP in
which the appellant’s wife was directed to deposit the amount before
the trial court has already been dismissed, the trial court vide order
dated 09.02.2021 refused to accept the Demand Draft presented by
the appellant by noting that such an application is not maintainable.
6.
This order dated 09.02.2021, where the trial court refused to
accept the DD for the remaining Rs.20 lacs, was challenged by the
appellant before the High Court through an application under Section
482 of CrPC. Vide impugned order dated 29.11.2022, the High Court
dismissed  the  application  of  appellant  on  the  ground  that  the
appellant failed to deposit the remaining Rs. 20 lacs within the time
stipulated (3 weeks) in the Supreme Court order dated 29.11.2019.
Now, the appellant is before us in the present appeal.
7.
On 14.03.2023, this Court passed an interim order directing the
appellant to deposit Rs.20 lacs before the trial court and sought a
compliance  report  from  the  trial  court.  This  Court  order  dated
4

14.03.2023 reads as follows:
“The petitioner shall deposit the sum of  ₹ 20 lakhs
before the trial court within two weeks. The trial court
shall  pass  an  order  recording  the  deposit  and  also
indicate whether the petitioner has duly complied with
the present order.
A copy of this order shall be communicated directly to
the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Ambala (seized of
Criminal Case No. 78 of 2014 arising out of FIR 35 of
2014).
The  trial  court  shall  then  report  compliance  to  the
Registry to this Court.
List after three weeks.”
Pursuant to the aforesaid order of this Court, appellant submitted two
cheques of amount Rs.10 lacs each before the trial court and the trial
court forwarded a compliance report to this Court mentioning that
appellant has duly complied with the interim order dated 14.03.2023.
Thereafter,  on the next date of hearing on 08.08.2023, this Court
recorded  the  compliance  of  its  previous  order  and  directed  the
appellant to further deposit Rs.10 lacs towards interest for delayed
payment. To make the matter clear, we would like to reproduce that
interim order of this Court, which read as follows:
“It is submitted that the petitioner has deposited  ₹20
lakhs  in  trial  court,  having  regard  to  the  delay  in
payment (8 years). In the circumstances of the case,
justice  would  demand  that  the  petitioner  deposits  a
further  sum  of  ₹10  lakhs  towards  interest  for  the
delayed payment (working out to 6% p.a. for the last 8
years). This amount shall be deposited in Court within
four weeks from today. The demand draft which has
been  deposited  before  the  trial  court  shall  be  re-
5

validated, in case it has expired in the meanwhile.
List after six weeks.”
8.
Trial Court vide order dated 01.09.2023 noted the compliance of
the above order of this Court. In this way, the appellant has by now
returned  the  entire  due  amount  and  also  paid  Rs.10  lacs  more
towards the interest for the delayed payment. When the matter again
came up  for  hearing  on 12.02.2024,  this  Court  recorded  that the
entire amount had been paid and, at the request of both sides, granted
time to both sides to draw a settlement. Later on, 11.03.2024, the
counsel representing the appellant stated that a settlement had been
reached between the parties whereas counsel for respondents sought
some  time  to  verify  the  same,  and  consequently,  the  matter  was
adjourned for today.
9.
Today, we heard both sides again. The counsel of Respondent
No.2 i.e., the complainant states that there is no settlement between
the  parties  and  the  complainant  is  not willing  to  compromise the
matter.  After  the  passing  of  the  previous  order  dated  11.03.2024,
Respondent No.2 (Complainant) has also filed an affidavit stating that
no settlement has been reached between the parties as alleged by the
appellant. On the other side, the counsel of the appellant contended
that since the appellant has paid back the entire amount of Rs.1.55
crore and has also paid a further sum of Rs.10 lacs towards the
6

interest, there is no ground left for continuing criminal proceedings
against the appellant.
10.
The significant fact here is that pending appeals before Additional
Sessions Judge against the appellant’s conviction under Section 138 of
the NI Act, initially both the sides had entered into a settlement in the
Lok Adalat, where they agreed that if the appellant compensates the
complainant by repaying the entire amount of Rs.1.55 crore then they
would get the offences compounded or quashed. However, the trial
court by order dated 11.07.2016 declared the settlement as frustrated
on the ground that the appellant could not pay the complainant on the
deadlines stipulated in the said settlement and the trial court might
have been right in doing so because settlement itself had a clause
which read as follows:
“5. That in case of default of making payment well in 
time according to dates mentioned above, the 
settlement shall be frustrated with immediate effect 
and then appeal shall be decided on merit.”
     Be that as it may,  it is also true that the complainant had
accepted the amount from the appellant later when the appellant
approached  higher  courts  showing  his  willingness  to  pay  the
amount as agreed between the parties.
11.
As per section 147 of the NI Act, all offences punishable under
the Negotiable Instruments Act are compoundable. However, unlike
7

Section 320 of CrPC, the NI Act does not elaborate upon the manner in
which offences should be compounded. To fill up this legislative gap,
three Judges Bench of this Court in  Damodar S. Prabhu  v. Sayed
Babalal H. (2010) 5 SCC 663, passed some guidelines under Article
142 of the Constitution of India regarding compounding of offence
under Section 138 of NI Act. But most importantly, in that case, this
Court  discussed  the  importance  of  compounding  offence  under
Section 138 of the NI Act and also the legislative intent behind making
the dishonour of cheque a crime by enacting a special law. This Court
had observed that:
“4. ………….  What must be remembered is that the
dishonour  of  a  cheque  can  be  best  described  as  a
regulatory offence that has been created to serve the
public  interest  in  ensuring  the  reliability  of  these
instruments.  The  impact  of  this  offence  is  usually
confined to the private parties involved in commercial
transactions.
5. Invariably, the provision of a strong criminal remedy
has encouraged the institution of a large number of
cases that are relatable to the offence contemplated by
Section 138 of the Act. So much so, that at present a
disproportionately large number of cases involving the
dishonour of  cheques  is  choking  our criminal  justice
system,  especially  at  the  level  of  Magistrates'
Courts……..”
Further, after citing authors pointing towards compensatory 
jurisprudence within the NI Act, this Court observed that:
“18. It is quite obvious that with respect to the offence 
of dishonour of cheques, it is the compensatory aspect 
8

of the remedy which should be given priority over the 
punitive aspect.”
12.
This Court has time and again reiterated that in cases of section
138 of NI Act, the accused must try for compounding at the initial
stages instead of the later stage, however, there is no bar to seek the
compounding of the offence at later stages of criminal proceedings
including after conviction, like the present case (See: K.M Ibrahim v.
K.P Mohammed & Anr. (2010) 1 SCC 798 and  O.P Dholakia  v.
State of Haryana & Anr. (2000) 1 SCC 762). 
In the case at hand, initially, both sides agreed to compound the
offence at the appellate stage but the appellant could not pay the
amount  within  the  time  stipulated  in  the  agreement  and  the
complainant now has shown her unwillingness towards compounding
of the offence, despite receiving the entire amount. The appellant has
paid the entire Rs.1.55 crore and further Rs.10 lacs as interest. 
As far the requirement of ‘consent’ in compounding of offence
under section 138 of NI Act is concerned, this Court in JIK Industries
Limited & Ors.  v. Amarlal V. Jamuni & Anr. (2012) 3 SCC 255
denied the suggestion of the appellant therein that ‘consent’ is not
mandatory in compounding of offences under Section 138 of NI Act.
This Court observed that:
“57. Section  147  of  the  Negotiable  Instruments  Act
9

reads as follows:
“147.Offences
 
to
 
be
 
compoundable.—
Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  the  Code  of
Criminal  Procedure,  1973  (2  of  1974),  every  offence
punishable under this Act shall be compoundable.”
58. Relying  on  the  aforesaid  non  obstante  clause  in
Section 147 of the NI Act, the learned counsel for the
appellant argued that a three-Judge Bench decision of
this Court in Damodar [(2010) 5 SCC 663 : (2010) 2
SCC (Civ) 520 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 1328] , held that in
view of non obstante clause in Section 147 of the NI Act,
which is a special statute, the requirement of consent of
the person compounding in Section 320 of the Code is
not required in the case of compounding of an offence
under the NI Act.
59. This  Court  is  unable  to  accept  the  aforesaid
contention for various reasons……”
Further this Court observed in para 89 of the said judgement that:
“Section 147 of the NI Act must be reasonably construed to
mean that as a result of the said section the offences under
the NI Act are made compoundable, but the main principle
of such compounding, namely, the consent of the person
aggrieved or the person injured or the complainant cannot
be wished away nor can the same be substituted by virtue
of Section 147 of the NI Act.”
This Court in Meters and Instruments private Ltd. And Another.  v.
Kanchan  Mehta  (2018)  1  SCC  560 after  discussing  the  series  of
judgments including the JIK Industries Ltd. (supra) observed that even
in the absence of ‘consent’ court can close criminal proceedings against
an accused in cases of section 138 of NI Act if accused has compensated
the complainant. The exact words of this Court were as follows:
10

“18.3. Though compounding requires consent of both
parties, even in absence of such consent, the court, in
the  interests  of  justice,  on  being  satisfied  that  the
complainant  has  been  duly  compensated, can  in  its
discretion  close  the  proceedings  and  discharge  the
accused.”
In our opinion,  Kanchan Mehta  (supra) nowhere contemplates that
‘compounding’ can be done without the ‘consent’ of the parties and
even  the  above  observation  of  Kanchan  Mehta  (supra)  giving
discretion to the trial court to ‘close the proceedings and discharge the
accused’, by reading section 2581 of CrPC, has been held to be ‘not a
good law’ by this Court in the subsequent 5 judges bench judgement in
Expeditious Trial of Cases Under Section 138 of NI Act, 1881,
In re, (2021) 16 SCC 1162.
All  the  same,  in  this  particular  given  case  even  though  the
complainant  has  been  duly  compensated  by  the  accused  yet  the
complainant does not agree for the compounding of the offence, the
courts  cannot  compel  the  complainant  to  give  ‘consent’  for
compounding of the matter.  It is also true that mere repayment of the
amount cannot mean that the appellant is absolved from the criminal
liabilities under Section 138 of the NI Act. But this case has some
1 258. Power to stop proceedings in certain cases.—In any summons-case instituted otherwise
than upon complaint, a Magistrate of the first class or, with the previous sanction of the Chief
Judicial Magistrate, any other Judicial Magistrate, may, for reasons to be recorded by him, stop the
proceedings  at  any  stage  without  pronouncing  any  judgment  and  where  such  stoppage  of
proceedings is made after the evidence of the principal witnesses has been recorded, pronounce a
judgment of acquittal, and in any other case, release the accused, and such release shall have the
effect of discharge.
2 Para 20.
11

peculiar facts as well. In the present case, the appellant has already
been in jail for more than 1 year before being released on bail and has
also compensated the complainant. Further, in compliance of the order
dated 08.08.2023, the appellant has deposited an additional amount of
Rs.10 lacs. There is no purpose now to keep the proceedings pending
in appeal before the lower appellate court. Here, we would like to point
out that quashing of a case is different from compounding. This Court
in  JIK  Industries  Ltd.3(Supra)  distinguished  the  quashing  of case
from compounding in the following words:
“Quashing of a case is different from compounding. In 
quashing the court applies it but in compounding it is 
primarily based on consent of the injured party. 
Therefore, the two cannot be equated.”
 In our opinion, if we allow the continuance of criminal appeals
pending  before  Additional  Sessions  Judge  against  the  appellant’s
conviction then it would defeat all the efforts of this Court in the last
year where this Court had monitored this matter and ensured that the
complainant gets her money back. 
13.
As far as FIR case under Sections 406, 420, 120B of IPC against
the appellant is concerned, in any case we do not find any merit in the
allegations  that  the  appellant  from  the  very  beginning  had  the
intention of cheating the complainant. It is a fact that the appellant
3 Para 43.
12

failed  to  procure  and  supply  the  ‘machine’  even  after  taking  the
advance money from the complainant but there is nothing on record to
show that the appellant had any ill intention of cheating or defrauding
the complainant from the very inception. The transaction between the
parties was purely civil in nature which does not attract criminal law
in any way.
14.
Even though complainant is unwilling to compound the case but,
considering the totality of facts and circumstances of the present case
which we have referred above, we are of the considered view that these
proceedings must come to an end.  We, therefore, allow this appeal
and set aside the impugned order of High Court dated 29.11.2022. We
also quash all the criminal proceedings qua appellant arising out of
FIR No.35 of 2014 at P.S Mahesh Nagar, Ambala pending before Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Ambala.  Since, criminal appeals filed by present
appellant against his conviction under Section 138 of the NI Act are
also pending, we deem it appropriate that the said proceedings should
also be quashed.  Hence, in order to do complete justice, we exercise
our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, and hereby
quash all  the  pending  criminal  appeals  on  the  file  of  Additional
Sessions Judge, Ambala Cantt., against the appellant in the present
matter, and  set aside  the  conviction and  sentence  awarded  to  the
13

appellant by the trial court.
15.
We also direct the trial court to hand over the Demand Drafts
totalling the  amount of  Rs.30 lacs to the complainant which were
deposited in the trial court in pursuance of this Court's orders, if not
handed-over till now.
Pending application(s), if any, stand(s) disposed of.
