THE APPEALS 
2. The cross appeals, one by the Tamil Nadu Medical 
Services Corporation Limited1 and the other by the 
Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation Employees 
Welfare Union2, question the judgment and order dated 
9th August, 2019, passed by the High Court of 
Judicature at Madras in W.P.Nos.17133 of 2001 and 
15241 of 2009 respectively. The position of the 
parties is in accordance with SLP(C)No.30005 of 2019. 
3. The impugned judgment came to be passed in Writ 
Petition No.17133/2001 which was directed against 
order dated 31st March, 2001 of the Inspector of 
Labour, Circle-III, Chennai3, by which the claim of 
53 workmen to be conferred permanent status in the 
Corporation was accepted, while the claim of 42 others 
was rejected. 
4. W.P. No.15241 of 2009 was filed by 22 out of the 
said 53 workmen seeking a writ of mandamus to be 
granted employment in the Corporation as per the order 
of the Inspector of Labour.

QUESTIONS BEFORE THIS COURT 
5. The questions that this Court is to consider    
are – 
(i) Whether the Tamil Nadu Industrial 
Establishments (Conferment of Permanent 
Status to Workmen) Act, 1981 would apply 
to the parties? 
(ii)   Whether by way of the impugned 
judgment, the suggestion to institute an 
‘Industrial Disputes Claim’ questioning 
non-employment was sustainable, given that 
the Inspector of Labour had already passed 
orders in that regard? 
 
FACTS IN BRIEF 
6.  The Corporation was incorporated under the Indian 
Companies Act, 1956 on 1st July, 1994.  Its management 
is under the State of Tamil Nadu.  It has employed 
various workmen in different capacities, including 
the appellants in the appeal arising out of 
SLP(C)No.2649 of 2020.  Such employees had sought 
regularization under the provisions of Tamil Nadu 
Industrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent 

4|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
Status to Workmen) Act, 19814.  Such representations 
being unsuccessful, two Writ Petitions bearing 
Nos.17263 and 17147 of 1998 were preferred before the 
learned Single Judge of the High Court.   
7. The learned Single Judge5, vide judgment and order 
dated 21st July, 2000 passed the following directions: 
“19…. 
1. 
The 
Tamil 
Nadu 
Industrial 
Establishments 
(Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen) 
Act, 1981 (Tamil Nadu Act 46 of 1981) is 
applicable 
to 
the 
second 
respondent 
corporation. 
 
2. 
The ‘Inspector’ having jurisdiction over the 
second respondent is directed to inspect and 
verify the records of the second respondent 
corporation and pass appropriated orders under 
Sec.3 of the said Act with regard to the claim 
made by the members of the petitioner Union; 
 
3. 
The ‘Inspector’ is also directed to consider 
the claim made by the petitioner Union 
regarding employment on Saturdays to the 
members of the petitioner Union; 
 
4. 
The 
‘Inspector’ 
is 
further 
directed 
to 
determine the above referred questions within 
three months from the date of a copy of this 
order after affording an opportunity of being 
heard to both parties; and 
 
5. Till an order is passed by the ‘Inspector’ as 
stated above, status quo as on date shall be 
maintained by both parties.  Writ petitions 
are allowed to the extent mentioned above.  No 
costs.  All the miscellaneous petitions are 
closed.”  
 
 
4 Hereinafter ‘the Act’. 
5 Annexure P1, pg 61. 

5|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
 8.   Pursuant to the above order, the Inspector of 
Labour passed order dated 31st March, 20016, wherein 
the following issues were framed : 
“ISSUES 
(a) Whether the act pertaining to conferment of 
permanent status of Workmen could be made 
applicable to the respondent Establishment 
 
(b) Whether the authorized office under the 
aforesaid act being Labour Inspector has got the 
authority to try this case? 
 
(c) If, the respondent’s Management is covered by 
the Jurisdiction of the aforesaid Act what is the 
nature of relief that could be awarded to the 
petitioners?”  
  
 
9. The Inspector of Labour concluded that G. Sumathi 
and 52 other workmen were in the service of the 
Corporation continuously for 480 days over a period 
of 24 months and accordingly they could be granted 
permanent status.   
10. It is against this order that the judgment and 
order impugned before us, eventually came to be 
passed. An appeal assailing the order dated 21st July, 
2000 and, an independent writ petition was filed 
against the order dated 31st March, 2001 of the 
Inspector of Labour, and Division Bench vide order 
 
6 Annexure P3, pg.98. 

6|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
dated 10th  December 20097 in such proceedings, 
confirmed both these orders and the Corporation was 
directed to provide employment to the Respondents, 
such as those who were before the Court as petitioners 
(original writ petitioners) in those proceedings. 
Against such confirmation of the order of the 
Inspector of Labour, Civil Appeal Nos. 6567 and 6568 
of 2012 were preferred. 
11. Hence, this Court on 29th March 2010 while issuing 
notice, stayed the operation of the impugned judgment. 
Subsequently, on 10th March, 2016, while allowing the 
appeal, this Court remanded the matter to the High 
Court, thus- 
“3. It has been submitted that while deciding 
the writ petitions and the connected matters, 
the High Court did not consider the fact 
whether the aforesaid Act is applicable to the 
members of the respondent-Union and the said 
submission appears to be correct.  
4. In the afore-stated circumstances, the 
impugned judgment is set aside and the matters 
are remanded to the High Court for considering 
the same afresh in accordance with law. We are 
sure that the High Court will hear the matters 
afresh and decide the same in accordance with 
law.  
 5. Interim order dated 29th March, 2010 
granted by this Court shall continue till the 
High Court modifies the same after hearing the 
concerned parties…”

THE IMPUGNED JUDGMENT   
At this juncture, it is worth clarifying that the 
dismissal of the Writ Appeal Nos.1430 & 1431 of 2000 
was not challenged before this Court and what was 
challenged was the dismissal of W.P.No.17133/2001 and 
the directions in W.P.No.15241/2009, which took on 
Civil Appeal Nos.6567 and 6568 of 2012, wherein the 
Court remanded the matter.     
12. Pursuant to the above order of remand, The High 
Court in its judgment, recorded its agreement with the 
judgment of the learned Single Judge, reproduced 
supra. It was observed that the learned Single Judge 
had extensively examined the constitution of the 
management 
of 
the 
Corporation, 
the 
nature 
of 
activities conducted by it, et cetera and then 
concluded that the Act would apply on the ground that 
it was an industrial establishment under Section 
2(3)(e) of the Act, and that they (the learned 
Division Bench) concur with the same.  
13. It was further observed that since no appeal stood 
preferred after the writ appeals against the order of 

8|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
the learned Single Judge, were dismissed, the order 
of the Inspector of Labour had become final. On 
independent analysis with respect to the application 
of the act on the Corporation, it was observed as 
under:  
“50.  However on independent analysis of the 
facts, 
we 
categorically 
hold 
that 
the 
provisions of Tamil Nadu Act, 46 of 1981 are 
applicable to TNMSC Management, in view of the 
fact that, TNMSC Management is an industrial 
establishment as defined under section 2(3)(e) 
of the Act and that it is an establishment as 
defined under section 2 (6) of Tamil Nadu Act, 
36 of 1947. By the above reasoning be 
conclusively hold that TNMSC Management is an 
industrial establishment and is covered under 
the provisions of Tamil Nadu Act, 46 of 1981.” 
 
SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES  
14.  We have heard the learned counsel for the parties 
and perused the written submission.  On behalf of the 
appellant, it has been submitted :- 
a) That the order dated 10th March, 2016 of this 
Court was not complied with.  The specific plea of 
the appellant that the Act as also the Tamil Nadu 
Shops and Establishments Act, 19478 would not be 
applicable to the appellant.  However, the same was 
not considered by the High Court.  The only manner in 
 
8 Hereinafter 1947 Act 

9|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
which the said Act could be applicable was that the 
Corporation would fall under the definition of 
‘commercial establishment’ under Section 2(3) of the 
1947 Act. 
b) That the impugned judgment did not analyze 
whether any of the activities of the Corporation fell 
under Section 2(3) of the 1947 Act.  Section 7 of the 
Act exempts such of those industrial establishments, 
that are engaged in construction activities and since 
some of the activities of the Corporation, include 
construction, the Corporation would be exempt. 
c) That most of the 53 employees who are 
appellants in Appeal arising out of SLP(C)No.2649 of 
2020, who were directed to be given permanent status 
by the Inspector of Labour, have obtained other 
profitable employment and the Corporation cannot be 
forced to grant permanent status.     
15. The respondent-Union has submitted – 
(a) That 
the Corporation is 
attempting 
to 
distinguish the status of the respondents by applying 

10|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
the ratio of State of Karnataka v. Uma Devi9 after 
having exploited them for years together as temporary 
employees.  Reliance has been placed on Maharashtra 
State Road Transport Corporation v. Casteribe Rajya 
Parivahan Karmachari Sanghathana10 and particularly, 
paragraphs 32 to 36 thereof.   
(b) Relying on U.P. Power Corporation Limited & 
Anr. v. Bijli Mazdoor Sangh & Ors.11, it is submitted 
that the industrial adjudicator, although can vary 
terms of employment, but cannot do anything violative 
of Article 14 and if the case at hand is covered by 
the concept of regularization, the same Rule applies.   
(c) Relying on ONGC Limited v. Petroleum Coal 
Labour Union & Ors.12 and Ajay Pal Singh v. Haryana 
Warehousing Corporation13, it is urged that the powers 
of Industrial and Labour Courts were not in 
consideration in Uma Devi (supra).   
(d) A tabular chart has been provided in respect 
of the 12 appellants in the Appeal arising out of 
SLP(C)No.2649 of 2020 and it is submitted that since 
 
9 (2006) 4 SCC 1 
10 (2009) 8 SCC 556 
11 (2007) 5 SCC 755 
12 (2015) 6 SCC 494 
13 (2015) 6 SCC 321 

11|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
the Inspector of Labour vide its order has declared 
the eligibility of the said workmen for grant of 
permanent status, there falls no requirement to raise 
an industrial dispute questioning the non-employment.  
Such of those respondents who have reached the age of 
superannuation would be entitled to compensation in 
lieu of regularization as recognized in Ranbir Singh 
v. S.K. Roy, Chairman, Life Insurance Corporation of 
India & Anr.14.

(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any

who is in continuous service for a period of 
four hundred and eighty days in a period of

(2) A workman shall be said to be in

for that period, in uninterrupted service, 
including service which may be interrupted 
on account of sickness or authorised leave 
or an accident or a strike, which is not 
illegal, 
or 
a

fault on the part of the workman. 
 
[Explanation [I]. 
- [For

in sub-sections (1) and (2), a workman shall 
be deemed to be in continuous service during

[Explanation II. - For the purpose of 
this section, Law' includes any award, 
agreement, settlement, instrument or 
contract of service whether made before 
or after the commencement of this Act.]” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
17. The core issue here is the application of the Act 
to the Corporation qua the employees and their Union.  
In order to examine the same, what is to be considered 
is as to whether the Corporation can be termed as an 
industrial establishment as per the provisions 
reproduced supra and whether the members of the Union 
would qualify as workmen and therefore would be 
eligible for permanent status under Section 3 of the 
Act.   
18. The High Court considered this question in line 
with Section 2(3)(e), as above, i.e., the definition 
of ‘establishment’ provided under section 2(6) of the 
1947 Act.   It reads thus – 
“2. Definitions- In this Act, unless there is 
anything repugnant in the subject or context- 

14|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
x       
x    
x      x    
       
(6) ‘establishment’ means a shop. commercial 
establishment, 
restaurant, 
eating-house, 
residential hotel, theatre or any place of 
public amusement or entertainment and includes 
such establishment as the 1 [State] Government 
may 
by 
notification 
declare 
to 
be 
an 
establishment for the purposes of this Act;” 
 
19.      For an establishment to be covered under the 
definition thereof under the 1947 Act, unless it is 
one of those specifically mentioned, it must satisfy 
being a commercial establishment which is defined 
under Section 2(3) which is as under - 
“(3) 
‘commercial 
establishment´ 
means 
an 
establishment which is not a shop but which 
carries 
on 
the 
business 
of 
advertising, 
commission, forwarding or commercial agency, or 
which is a clerical department of a factory or 
industrial undertaking or which is an insurance 
company, joint stock company, bank, broker’s 
office or exchange and includes such other 
establishments as the State Government may by 
notification 
declare 
to 
be 
a 
commercial 
establishment for the purposes of this Act.” 
 
20. The affidavit dated 16th September, 2009 filed by 
the Corporation before the High Court records that 
the actual turnover for the year 2007-2008 is Rs.27.5 
crores, vis-à-vis, the value of drugs distributed 
being at Rs.186.60 crores.  The order of the Inspector 
of Labour records as under - 

15|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
  “Further 
the 
respondent 
advanced 
the 
arguments that the Tamil Nadu Medical Services 
Corporation is not functioning with any profit 
motive, that quality argues are being obtained 
from quality manufacturing and supplied the 
same to the consumers without obtaining any 
service charges and therefore, the respondent’s 
establishment 
is 
not 
attending 
to 
any 
commercial duty and while perusing all the 
aforesaid factors and also the audited balance 
sheets of the respondents filed on behalf of 
the petitioner i.e. for the years 1994-95, 1995-
96 and 1996-97 it is seen that for the year 
1994-95 the profit to the tune of Rs.6.96 lakhs 
and for 1995-96 Rs.8.44 lakhs and for 1996-97 
Rs.1.84 lakhs had been obtained.  Therefore it 
is 
clearly 
seen 
that 
the 
respondent’s 
establishment has no profit intention as 
mentioned by the respondent is not at all true.” 
 
 
21.  For any establishment to be commercial, it has to 
be established that the activities undertaken by it 
are for making some monetary gain.  Commercial in the 
most rudimentary sense means buying or selling of 
goods in exchange of money. As the above reproduced, 
uncontroverted paragraph (also recorded by the High 
Court) establishes, the commercial element was not 
absent.   
22. Further, it was submitted that the activities 
conducted by the Corporation did not fall under those 
mentioned under Section 2(3) of the 1947 Act. This 
submission 
too, 
is 
difficult 
to 
accept. 
The 
construction work, which the Corporation, by its own 

16|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
admission, carries out, is also for non-governmental 
bodies such as firms, companies, and individuals. It 
would be apposite to refer to the observations of the 
High Court in this regard, in particular, paragraphs 
37 and 38 of the impugned decision, which, for ease 
of reference are reproduced below : 
“37. TNMSC Management is a company registered 
under the Indian Companies Act, 1956 which iv 
wholly owned by the Government of Tamil Nadu.  
The objects of the company as seen from the 
memorandvm of articles of association are as 
follows : 
“(1) To buy or otherwise acquire all 
kinds and varieties of generic and patent 
medicines, drugs, mixtures, formulations, 
tablets, pills, powders, pharmaceutical and 
wadical 
products, 
needles, 
syringes, 
injectables, vaccinesr sera, immunogens, 
phylacogens, 
chemicals 
and 
surgical 
dressings, kits and instruments and to sell 
or supply to various hospitals and other 
health centres. 
    (ii) To 
purchase, 
distribute, 
assemble, install, maintain or otherwise 
deal in all types of capitai quipments and 
instruments required in hospitals. 
  
(iii)To 
undertake 
designing 
and 
construction of Hospitals and or other 
buildings for Government, or for any other 
person 
including 
local 
authorities, 
corporations, societies, trusts, companies, 
firms and individuals. 
  
(iv)To establish modern varehouses and 
Engineering 
workshops 
to 
manufacture, 
assemble, repair or otherwise maintain 
various 
medical 
equipments, 
surgical 
instruments, diagnostic equipments, fire-
fighting 
equipments, 
furniture 
and 
– 
fittings including, hospital furniture and 
also to undertake civil and other general 
maintenance of hospitals. 

17|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
  
(v)To 
establish 
research 
and 
development centres and institutes for 
medical and para-medical personnel for 
imparting 
training 
in 
various 
Techno-
Managerial fields.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
38. It is also seen that TNMSC Management has 
warehouses in channel and in all. The District 
Headquarters.  These warehouses are used for 
storing of medicines and drugs.  It has been 
specifically held as a fact by the Inspector of 
Labour in the order dated 31.03.2001, that TNMSC 
Management had earned profit of Rs.6.95 lakhs 
in the year 1994-95, Rs.8.44 lakhs in the year 
1995-96 mnd As.1.84 lakhs in the year 1996-97.  
Consequently, any contention raised that it is 
run on a “no profit basis” has to rejected.” 
 
23. It was argued that the Corporation’s activities 
included construction and therefore it would be exempt 
from the application of the Act.  Section 7 reads 
thus- 
“7. Act not to apply to workmen employed 
in certain industrial establishment. – 
Nothing contained in this Act shall apply 
to workmen employed in an industrial 
establishment 
engaged 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
buildings, 
bridges, 
roads, canals, dams or other construction 
work whether structural, mechanical or 
electrical.” 
 
The language of the provision is clear. It implies 
that this act shall not apply to those workmen who 
are engaged in the construction of buildings and the 
like or other construction work be it structural, 
mechanical, 
or 
electrical. 
Therefore, 
those 

18|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
establishments and their workmen shall be exempt, who 
are engaged exclusively, in the work of construction. 
The objectives of the Corporation, which have been 
reproduced15 in the affidavit of the Union before the 
High Court, state:- 
“ 
x  
 
     x 
 
 
 
       
x  
iii) 
To 
undertake 
the 
designing 
and 
construction of hospitals and other buildings 
for the Government, or any other person 
including local authorities, corporations, 
societies, 
trusts, 
companies 
firms 
and 
individuals.  
…” 
 
24. This, however, in our view would not allow the 
Corporation to wash its hands off the responsibilities 
or obligations under the Act, since the construction 
to be undertaken by the Corporation, is only one of 
the many activities to be undertaken by it. To take 
all the workers out of the purview of the Act, 
especially, when the said workers, like the members 
of the respondent union, were not the ones undertaking 
construction is unwarranted.  
 
15 Page 137 of the paperbook in SLP (c) 2649 of 2020 

19|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
25. It was further argued that many of the persons 
directed to be granted permanent employment by the 
order of the Inspector of Labour have found profitable 
employment elsewhere, and as such the SLP on their 
behalf should be dismissed. We cannot accept this 
submission.  Simply because some of the persons 
involved in the employment dispute have allegedly 
found other employment, that does not justify a 
dismissal 
of 
others’ 
claims. 
Per 
the 
written 
submissions of the appellants in the appeal arising 
out of SLP(C)No.2649 of 2020, twelve appellants have 
approached this court. And therefore, it must be seen 
to its logical conclusion. 
26. It was argued before the Courts below that the 
respondents had not continued in service after a 
certain point in time, however, the said argument was 
not accepted and we find no reason to take a different 
view on fact which since the year 1997 remains proven 
and recognized by the Courts.   
27. As such, both requirements, of the establishment 
being covered under the definition of industrial 
establishment as provided and that of the employee 

20|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
having uninterruptedly continued in service for 480 
days or more for 24 months, having been met we have 
no hesitation in holding that the Act would apply to 
the parties to the present dispute.   
28.  The next question to be considered is whether the 
High Court on remand, could have ignored the order of 
the Inspector of Labour and suggested that the 
employees raise an industrial dispute questioning 
their non-employment.  The reason for remand, as is 
seen from the judgment dated 10th March, 2016, was 
that the High Court had not considered that the Act 
would be applicable to the parties, which were the 
very same as the parties before us.  In other words, 
the scope of remand was limited.  The order of the 
Inspector of Labour was passed under the Act.  Since 
the High Court concluded that the Act would apply, 
there was no reason for it to disturb the finding of 
the Inspector of Labour and, therefore, it ought to 
have simply ordered that the order of Inspector of 
Labour which concluded that the members of the 
respondent-Union be given permanent employment, be 
complied with.  When an issue stands already decided 

21|SLP(C)30005/2019 
 
and such decision does not suffer from any vice of 
authority or jurisdiction then, putting those who 
enjoy an order in their favour through the wringer 
once more of having to re-establish their claim, this 
time before the authority under the Industrial 
Disputes Act, 1947, would be unjustified.     
29. The appeal filed by the Corporation (Appeal 
arising out of SLP(C)No.30005 of 2019) is, in terms 
of the above, dismissed and the appeal filed by the 
respondent-Union through its President, G. Sumathi 
(Appeal arising out of SLP(C)No.2649 of 2020) is 
accordingly allowed with all consequences in favour 
of the respondent-employees, under the law, to follow.  
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand 
disposed of.
