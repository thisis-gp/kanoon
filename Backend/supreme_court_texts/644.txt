the NCDRC dated 15.09.2023 partly allowing the 
complaint. 
3. 
The 
appellant 
-Dharmendra 
Sharma 
had       
applied 
for 
allotment 
and 
purchase 
of 
an        
apartment (residential flat) in the category of      
Super Deluxe 2 on 28.07.2011 and had deposited 
the booking amount of Rs.4,60,000/- along with 
the application. This application was submitted 
pursuant to an advertisement issued by the ADA 
for a group housing project lodged in the name of 
ADA Heights, Taj Nagari, Phase II at Fatehabad 
Road, near Taj Express Way, Ring Road, Agra. The 
allotment 
was 
done 
by 
lottery 
system 
on 
29.08.2011 whereby the appellant was allotted Flat 
No.DT-1/1204 which was communicated vide letter 
 
3 ADA 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 3 of 19 
 
dated 19.09.2011, according to which the tentative 
price of the apartment was Rs.56,54,000/- which 
could 
be 
deposited 
in 
24 
equal 
quarterly 
instalments or could be paid in full with certain 
other relaxations.  The appellant, opted for full 
payment 
and 
accordingly 
vide 
letter 
dated 
21.10.2011, attached two cheques, one by the 
appellant of Rs.6.94 lakhs and the other of Rs.45 
lakhs issued by the LIC Housing Finance Limited. 
Possession was to be given within six months under 
the scheme. 
4. 
Upon completion of six months, the appellant 
requested for possession vide communication dated 
03.04.2012. Apparently, the construction was not 
completed and, in any case, not ready for delivery 
of possession, as such no possession was delivered 
even after six months. The appellant thereafter 
received a communication dated 04.02.2014 
offering possession subject to further payment of 
Rs.3,43,178/- along with non-judicial stamp paper 
for 
execution 
of 
the 
deed 
amounting 
to 
Rs.3,99,100/-.  The demand so raised was under 
the following three heads: 
i) 
Rs.84,300/- for solar system; 
ii) 
Rs.46,878/- as leased premium; and 
iii) 
Rs.2,12,000/- for covered parking area. 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 4 of 19 
 
5. 
On receipt of the said letter, the appellant visited 
the site as also the office of ADA on 15.02.2014. He 
deposited the non-judicial stamp papers as 
required of Rs.3,99,100/-. But after inspection of 
the site, he found various deficiencies in the 
construction which were reported to the Assistant 
Engineer of the ADA with the request that once the 
deficiencies are removed, he may be communicated 
for taking over possession. ADA sent reminders 
dated 
22.09.2014 
and 
20/21.11.2014 
for 
depositing the balance amount of Rs.3,82,748/-.  
The appellant, on the other hand, was demanding 
for completion certificate. There is a further 
communication by the ADA dated 17.01.2018 
demanding an amount of Rs.6,11,575/- and for 
taking possession after depositing the same and 
getting the deed executed.  On the other hand, the 
appellant, vide communication dated 02.04.2018, 
requested for waiver of interest on the balance 
amount and also sought confirmation whether the 
flat was ready for physical possession.  
6. 
It was thereafter that the appellant along with letter 
dated 04.06.2019, sent a cheque dated 01.06.2019 
for 
Rs.3,43,178/- 
and 
again 
requested 
for 
confirmation of the date of possession. The ADA 
encashed the said cheque but did not inform any 
date for handing over possession.  It looks like the 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 5 of 19 
 
appellant got the loan transferred to the State Bank 
of India 4  whereupon the SBI is writing letters 
demanding the title deed of the apartment vide 
communications dated 14.03.2017, 25.06.2019 
and 19.10.2019. These communications further 
mention that in case the title deed is not deposited, 
then penal interest @2% p.a. would be levied.  The 
appellant again reiterated his earlier request for 
waiver of interest on balance amount vide reminder 
dated 
18.09.2019 
and 
again 
requested 
for 
confirmation whether the flat was ready for 
physical possession. The appellant again visited the 
office of ADA on 23.11.2019 and requested for 
completion certificate and firefighting clearance 
certificate, which were not provided.  He again 
visited the site and found that the apartment was 
not in a habitable condition.  The appellant thus 
proceeded to institute a complaint before the 
NCDRC on 10.07.2020 alleging deficiency in service 
as also unfair trade practice on the part of ADA.       
7. 
  The ADA filed its reply in which the amounts as 
deposited by the appellant, as noted above, were 
admitted.  Further, according to ADA, the 
construction was ready and possession was offered 
on 04.02.2014 along with demand of Rs.3,43,178/- 
which the appellant did not pay and continued to 
 
4 SBI 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 6 of 19 
 
claim for waiver of interest and had ultimately paid 
the said amount on 04.06.2019 vide cheque dated 
01.06.2019. According to ADA, after adjustment 
there 
was 
still 
an 
outstanding 
amount 
of 
Rs.4,71,159/- as on 05.02.2021. It was also stated 
in the written statement that in 2011, at the time 
of allotment, the tentative price was Rs.56,54,000/- 
and under Clause 45 of the Registration and 
Allotment Rules, it was clearly mentioned that the 
price could vary upto 10%.  Further, according to 
ADA, the demand raised by the letter dated 
04.02.2014 of solar system, lease premium and car 
parking were apart from the cost of the flat and not 
due to increased cost.  The appellant had 
unnecessarily delayed payment of the demand 
raised on 04.02.2014. It was also stated in the 
written statement that out of the 582 apartments 
built under the project in question, except for 20 
allottees, all other allottees had taken possession. 
The ADA further pleaded that the complaint was 
barred by time and secondly, that as the total 
payment 
made 
by 
the 
appellant 
was 
Rs.59,97,178/-, as such it would not fall within the 
pecuniary limit of the NCDRC, and therefore, the 
complaint was liable to be dismissed for the above 
two reasons also. 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 7 of 19 
 
8. 
The parties led their evidence.  The NCDRC rejected 
technical objections raised by the ADA regarding 
limitation as also the pecuniary jurisdiction.  In so 
far as the limitation is concerned, the NCDRC held 
that as subsequent demand and reminders were 
sent by the ADA and the ADA even accepted the 
cheque of Rs.3,43,178/- in 2019, it was not open 
for the ADA to raise the plea of limitation.  In so far 
as the pecuniary jurisdiction is concerned, the 
NCDRC held that the claim was of more than Rs.2 
crores as such the said objection was also not 
sustainable.  The NCDRC, however, held that the 
additional demand made by the ADA vide 
communication dated 04.02.2014 although was 
other than additional cost of 10% which was 
permissible but, in any case, it was within the 10% 
admissible clause, as such could not be held to be 
illegal. The NCDRC also held that if the possession 
was delayed beyond two years, the appellant would 
be entitled for a refund but in the present case, 
Clause 27 of the Registration and Allotment Rules 
would not be applicable.  The NCDRC further held 
that although the appellant had deposited the non-
judicial 
stamps 
worth 
Rs.3,99,100/- 
on 
15.02.2014 but he continued to delay payment of 
additional demand of Rs.3,43,178/- and was 
continuously requesting for waiver of interest 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 8 of 19 
 
resulting into the presumption that he was avoiding 
payment of the balance amount.  On such finding 
the NCDRC denied to grant interest from the date 
of deposit but made it applicable from the date of 
the filing of the complaint.  In so far as the 
deficiency in construction was concerned, the 
NCDRC found that only bald allegations have been 
made by the appellant and he never made any effort 
to get a report from the Commissioner and allowed 
the apartment in question to remain locked for six 
years. 
9. 
After considering the pleadings and evidence on 
record and in view of the above findings, the 
complaint was partly allowed by the NCDRC on 
15.09.2023.  
10. The appellant preferred a Review Application which 
was dismissed by the NCDRC by its order dated 
30th October, 2023. In the Review Application also, 
the NCDRC reiterated that the review was liable to 
be rejected as while offering possession, the ADA 
vide letter dated 04.12.2014 had made a further 
demand which amount was not deposited within 
the time and it was only deposited in 2019 and that 
too without interest and the complaint was made 
after six years and, therefore, the appellant would 
not be entitled to interest from the date of deposit.  

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 9 of 19 
 
11. In the two appeals filed by the appellant, the relief 
claimed is to the extent that the payment of interest 
be awarded from the date of deposit while refunding 
the same and not from the date of the complaint.  
Whereas in the appeal filed by the ADA, it is 
submitted that in view of the fact that the petition 
had been filed after six years from the date of 
offering possession, as such it was barred by 
limitation and also as the amount deposited was 
only Rs.59,91,000/- i.e. less than Rs.1 crore, the 
complaint ought to have been filed before the State 
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and the 
NCDRC would have no pecuniary jurisdiction to 
entertain the complaint with a value of less than 
Rs.1 crore. 
12. We have heard Shri Vipin Sanghi, learned senior 
counsel appearing for the appellant and Shri 
Sudhir Kulshreshtha, learned counsel for the ADA 
in all the three appeals. 
13. The facts as recorded above are not disputed. Even 
the NCDRC did not find any contradiction in the 
factual aspect.  The only issue is as to whether the 
possession as offered on 04.12.2014 should be 
taken as a valid offer of possession even if there was 
no completion certificate and also whether the 
firefighting clearance certificate was available with 
the ADA or not.  Despite specific requests and 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 10 of 19 
 
demands by the appellant for providing the 
completion certificate and firefighting clearance, 
the ADA failed to produce the same. Senior Counsel 
for the appellant has relied upon the following 
judgments in support of his submission that offer 
for possession would be invalid where the 
completion certificate and firefighting clearance 
certificate have not been obtained by the developer 
i.e. ADA: 
(a) Debashis 
Sinha 
& 
Ors. 
vs. 
R.N.R. 
Enterprise5 
(b) Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure 
Limited vs. Union of India & Ors.6 
(c) Treaty 
Construction 
vs. 
Ruby 
Tower 
Cooperative Housing Society Ltd.7 
 
It is then submitted that even before the 
NCDRC the completion certificate and the 
firefighting clearance certificate could not be 
produced by the respondent -ADA. 
14. It is also submitted on behalf of the appellant that 
under the provisions of RERA Act, 2016 as also the 
UP (Promotion of Apartment and Ownership and 
Maintenance) Act, 2010 offer of possession would 
be valid only after a developer obtains the 
 
5 (2023) 3 SCC 195 
6 (2019) 8 SCC 416 
7 (2019) 8 SCC 157 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 11 of 19 
 
completion certificate, which had not been done so 
far by the developer ADA in the present case.  On 
behalf of the appellant, it is also argued that the 
demand of Rs.3,43,178/- along with alleged offer of 
possession 
dated 
14.02.2014 
was 
totally 
unjustified and illegal. It was also submitted that 
the appellant having deposited the amount of 
approximately Rs.60 lakhs and that too after taking 
loan from financial institutions, cannot be deprived 
of counting the interest from the date of deposit 
rather than from the date of filing of the complaint. 
In support of this submission, reliance has been 
placed upon the following judgments: 
(a) Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. 
Balbir Singh8  
(b) Rishab 
Singh 
Chandel 
& 
Anr. 
vs. 
Parsvnath Developers Ltd. & Anr.9 
(c) Lucknow 
Development 
Authority 
vs. 
M.K.Gupta10 
(d) Marvel Omega Builders Pvt. Ltd. vs. Shri 
Hari Gokhale & Ors.11 
(e) Experion Developers Pvt. Ltd. vs. Sushma 
Ashok Shierror12 
15. On such submissions it was prayed by the 
appellant that his appeals be allowed and the 
 
8 (2004) 5 SCC 65 
9 Civil Appeal No.3053 of 2023 
10 (1994) 1 SCC 243 
11 (2020) 16 SCC 226 
12 (2022) 6 SCALE 16 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 12 of 19 
 
interest be awarded from the date of deposit and to 
that extent the impugned judgment and order of 
NCDRC be modified. Further that the appeal filed 
by the respondent be dismissed.  
16. Having considered the submissions of both parties, 
we are of the opinion that both have contributed to 
delays at various stages. The respondent ADA 
raised an objection that the complaint was barred 
by limitation, claiming that the complaint was filed 
on 10.07.2020, well beyond the statutory limitation 
period prescribed under Section 24A of the 
Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which mandates 
that a complaint must be filed within two years 
from the date on which the cause of action arises. 
ADA argued that the offer of possession made on 
04.02.2014 should have triggered the limitation 
period. However, the NCDRC, in its impugned order, 
rightly rejected this argument by considering that 
the respondent ADA issued reminders to the 
appellant 
on 
22.09.2014, 
21.11.2014, 
and 
17.01.2018. 
Additionally, 
ADA 
accepted 
the 
appellant's 
payment 
of 
Rs. 
3,43,178/- 
on 
20.06.2019 without any reservations. Given these 
facts, the NCDRC correctly applied Sections 18 and 
19 of the Limitation Act, 1963, which extend the 
limitation 
period 
where 
part 
payments 
or 
acknowledgments are made. Consequently, the 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 13 of 19 
 
cause of action continued to exist, and the filing of 
the complaint in July 2020 is within the limitation 
period. 
17. This Court concurs with the NCDRC's reasoning 
and affirms that the complaint was not barred by 
limitation. The ongoing interactions between the 
parties, including ADA's acceptance of part 
payment in 2019 and the reminders sent, effectively 
extended the limitation period under established 
legal principles. However, while the complaint is 
within limitation, we also recognize that the 
appellant delayed making the balance payment of 
Rs. 3,43,178/- for over five years, from 2014 to 
2019. This delay was largely due to the appellant’s 
requests for a waiver of interest, which, while 
understandable, contributed significantly to the 
delay in finalizing the transaction. 
18. In light of these circumstances, while the appellant 
is entitled to a refund along with interest, it would 
be inequitable to award interest from the date of the 
original payment in 2011 given the appellant’s role 
in the delay.  
19. The respondent ADA has also challenged the 
pecuniary jurisdiction of the NCDRC, contending 
that the total payment made by the appellant 
amounted to Rs. 59,97,178/-, which was less than 
Rs. 1 crore. As such, ADA argued that the 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 14 of 19 
 
complaint should have been filed before the State 
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and not 
the NCDRC, which has jurisdiction over matters 
exceeding Rs. 1 crore as per Section 21(a)(i) of the 
Consumer Protection Act, 1986. This Court finds 
no merit in ADA’s argument. The NCDRC, in its 
impugned order, correctly observed that the claim 
made by the appellant was not limited to the 
deposit 
amount 
alone 
but 
also 
included 
compensation for mental agony, harassment, and 
loss of income, which brought the total claim well 
above Rs. 1 crore. In consumer disputes, the value 
of the claim is determined not just by the amount 
deposited but by the aggregate relief sought, which 
includes 
compensation 
and 
other 
claims. 
Therefore, the NCDRC rightly held that it had the 
requisite pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the 
complaint, and this Court affirms that finding. 
 
20. The appellant’s key contention regarding the 
absence 
of 
the 
completion 
certificate 
and 
firefighting clearance certificate merits serious 
consideration. The appellant consistently raised 
this issue, asserting that a valid offer of possession 
cannot be made without these documents. Section 
4(5) 
of 
the 
UP 
Apartment 
(Promotion 
of 
Construction, Ownership & Maintenance) Act, 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 15 of 19 
 
2010 and Section 19(10) of the RERA Act, 2016 
mandate that a developer must obtain these 
certificates before offering possession. Despite the 
appellant's repeated requests, ADA failed to 
produce these certificates, rendering its offer of 
possession incomplete and legally invalid. 
21. The appellant has rightly cited relevant precedents 
to bolster this argument. In Debashis Sinha v. 
R.N.R. Enterprise (2023)13, this Court held that 
possession offered without the requisite completion 
certificate is illegal, and a purchaser cannot be 
compelled 
to 
take 
possession 
in 
such 
circumstances. The Court in that case held: 
“20. Finally, we cannot resist but comment on the 
perfunctory approach of Ncdrc while dealing 
with the appellants' contention that it was the 
duty of the respondents to apply for and obtain 
the completion certificate from KMC and that the 
respondents ought to have been directed to act in 
accordance with law. The observation made 
by Ncdrc of the respondents having successfully 
argued that it was not their fault, that no 
completion certificate of the project could be 
obtained, is clearly contrary to the statutory 
provisions. 
 
21. Sub-section (2) of Section 403 of the KMC Act 
was referred to by Ncdrc in the impugned order 
[Debashis Sinha v. R.N.R. Enterprise, 2020 SCC 
OnLine NCDRC 429] . Sub-section (1) thereof, 
which finds no reference therein, requires every 
person giving notice under Section 393 or Section 
394 or every owner of a building or a work to 
which the notice relates to send or cause to be 
delivered or sent to the Municipal Commissioner a 
notice in writing of completion of erection of 
 
13 (2023) 3 SCC 195 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 16 of 19 
 
building or execution of work within one month of 
such completion/erection, accompanied by a 
certificate in the form specified in the rules made 
in this behalf as well as to give to the Municipal 
Commissioner 
all 
necessary 
facilities 
for 
inspection of such building or work. 
 
22. Section 393 mandates every person, who 
intends to erect a building, to apply for sanction 
by giving notice in writing of his intention to the 
Municipal Commissioner in such form and 
containing such information as may be prescribed 
together with such documents and plans. 
Similarly, Section 394 also mandates every 
person who intends to execute any of the works 
specified in clause (b) to clause (m) of sub-section 
(1) of Section 390 to apply for sanction by giving 
notice in writing of his intention to the Municipal 
Commissioner in such form and containing such 
information as may be prescribed. 
 
23. It is, therefore, evident on a conjoint reading 
of Sections 403, 390 and 394 of the KMC Act that 
it is the obligation of the person intending to erect 
a building or to execute works to apply for 
completion certificate in terms of the Rules framed 
thereunder. It is no part of the flat owner's duty to 
apply for a completion certificate. When the 
respondents had applied for permission/sanction 
to erect, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation 
Buildings Rules, 1990 (hereafter “the 1990 Rules” 
for short) were in force. Rule 26 of the 1990 Rules 
happens to be the relevant Rule. In terms of sub-
rules (1) to (3) of Rule 26 thereof, the obligation as 
cast was required to be discharged by the 
respondents. 
Evidently, 
the 
respondents 
observed the statutory provisions in the breach.” 
 
This position is supported by other decisions, 
including 
Pioneer 
Urban 
Land 
and 
Infrastructure 
Ltd. 
(supra) 
and 
Treaty 
Construction (supra), where the absence of these 
certificates was found to constitute a deficiency in 
service. In the present case, the ADA’s failure to 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 17 of 19 
 
provide the required certificates justifies the 
appellant’s refusal to take possession. This 
strengthens the appellant’s claim for additional 
compensation to compensate for the delay caused 
by ADA’s breach of its statutory obligations.  
22. This Court is of the considered view that both 
parties have exhibited lapses in their respective 
obligations. On the one hand, the appellant, despite 
having paid the tentative price of Rs. 56,54,000/- 
in 2012, failed to remit the additional amount of Rs. 
3,43,178/-, as demanded by the ADA, even after 
being repeatedly reminded. Instead, the appellant 
persistently sought a waiver of the penal interest on 
the delayed payment, eventually settling the 
amount only on 04.06.2019, a significant delay that 
cannot be overlooked and that too without the 
interest component which had further accrued over 
a period of about five years. On the other hand, the 
ADA, despite making an offer of possession in 2014, 
did not fulfil its statutory obligations by providing 
the requisite completion certificate and firefighting 
clearance certificate, both of which are essential for 
a valid and lawful offer of possession. The absence 
of these documents, which were also not furnished 
before the NCDRC, unquestionably vitiates the offer 
of possession made by the ADA. 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024 
 
Page 18 of 19 
 
23. In light of the aforementioned observations and 
taking into account the shortcomings on the part of 
both the appellant and the ADA, this Court deems 
it appropriate to provide a compensation of Rs. 
15,00,000/- (Fifteen Lakhs only) apart from what 
was awarded by the NCDRC. Therefore, apart from 
the refund of the entire amount deposited by the 
appellant 
@ 
9% 
interest 
per 
annum 
from 
11.07.2020 till the date of refund, the ADA is 
directed to pay an additional amount of Rs. 
15,00,000/- (Fifteen Lakhs only) to the appellant. 
The entire amount should be rendered to the 
appellant within three months of this order. We also 
order the ADA to return the non-judicial stamp 
worth Rs. 3,99,100/- back to the appellant.  
24. Furthermore, we refrain from imposing any 
exemplary costs on either party, recognizing that 
both have contributed to the situation at hand. It is 
also to be noted that the ADA, being a civic body 
tasked with serving the public and operating on a 
non-profit basis, should not be unduly penalized in 
a manner that could impede its functioning. 
25. The Civil Appeals 2809-2810 of 2024 are disposed 
of accordingly. 
26. The appeal filed by the ADA i.e. Civil Appeal 
No.6344 of 2024 stands dismissed, as its primary 

C.A. No.2809-2810/2024

arguments regarding both limitation and pecuniary
