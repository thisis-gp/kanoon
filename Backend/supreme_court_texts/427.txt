FACTUAL ASPECT 
 
1. 
The issue involved in this appeal is about the legality of 
the imposition of a reliability charge by the appellant, a 
distribution licensee. The appellant is a company incorporated 
under the Companies Act, 1956. It is principally responsible 
for the distribution and supply of electricity in the entire State 
of Maharashtra, except the areas that expressly fall within the 
responsibility of the utilities like the Brihanmumbai Electric 
Supply and Transport Undertaking, TATA Power Company, 
Reliance Energy Limited, etc. The 1st respondent is a steel 
industry, which claims to be one of the largest consumers of 
electricity supplied by the appellant. The 1st respondent is 
exporting its end products and earning significant foreign 
exchange for the country.

2. 
On the petition filed by the appellant, the Maharashtra 
Electricity Regulatory Commission (for short, ‘the Commission’) 
passed a tariff order on 20th October 2006, imposing additional 
supply charges for uninterrupted power supply to the bulk 
consumers like the 1st respondent. In the next tariff order 
passed on 20th June 2008, the Commission discontinued the 
additional supply charges with immediate effect. It directed the 
appellant to refund the additional supply charges collected 
from bulk industries during the financial years 2006-07 and 
2007-08. According to the case of the 1st respondent, as it is a 
continuous process industry and a bulk consumer, the 
appellant did not subject them to load-shedding. Therefore, the 
tariff was specifically fixed slightly higher than that for HT non-
continuous process industries.  
3. 
The 
appellant 
submitted 
a 
petition 
before 
the 
Commission under the Electricity Act, 2003 (for short, ‘the 
2003 Act’) for approval of reliability charges to be recovered for 
implementing Zero Load Shedding (ZLS) in the area covered by 
Pen Circle in Maharashtra. Permission was sought to appoint 
the Humanist Consumer Council as an interim franchisee. As 
per the directions of the Commission, a public notice was 
published for inviting objections. The Commission conducted a 
public hearing. By the order dated 15th June 2009, the 
Commission allowed the petition filed by the appellant and 
imposed a reliability charge from 16th June 2009 to 31st 
March 2010 on account of ZLS, which was made payable by all 
the consumers in the Pen Circle area, including the 1st 
respondent. Being aggrieved by the said order of the 

            Civil Appeal No. 8413 of 2009 
      
 
 
 
          Page 3 of 6 
 
Commission, an appeal was preferred by the 1st respondent 
before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (for short, ‘the 
Tribunal’). By the impugned judgment, the order of the State 
Commission dated 15th June 2009 was set aside.  
SUBMISSION 
4. 
Learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant has 
taken us through the impugned order, and the order dated 15th 
June 2009 passed by the Commission. The learned senior 
counsel submitted that the reliability charge existed in Pune, 
Baramati, Vashi and Thane circles. Relying upon Section 62 (3) 
of the 2003 Act, he submitted that the Commission has 
adequate powers to bring in schemes to improve the nature of 
supply in a particular area. He submitted that though the 
Commission published a public hearing notice, the 1st 
respondent did not participate in the hearing. He submitted 
that non-participation in the public hearing amounts to 
consent given by the 1st respondent to pay the reliability 
charge. He would, therefore, urge that the 1st respondent had 
no locus to challenge the order of the Commission dated 15th 
June 2009, and its remedy was to apply for review. He pointed 
out that the reliability charge was imposed for a limited period 
between 16th June 2009 and 31st March 2010, and at the time 
of the extension of the scheme, the 1st respondent could have 
raised an objection. He submitted that the 1st respondent is a 
bulk electricity consumer, consuming about 45 per cent of the 
electricity consumed in Pen Circle. Still, the 1st respondent did 
not participate in the public hearing conducted by the 
Commission. He submitted that the 1st respondent was 

            Civil Appeal No. 8413 of 2009 
      
 
 
 
          Page 4 of 6 
 
enjoying ZLS and, therefore, was liable to pay the reliability 
charge, which HT industrial consumers are paying in Pune, 
Baramati, Thane and Vashi circles. He would, thus, submit 
that the view taken by the Tribunal is erroneous.  
5. 
Learned senior counsel appearing for the first respondent 
invited our attention to findings recorded by the Tribunal and 
submitted that the view taken by the Tribunal cannot be 
interfered with.  
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS 
6. 
The question which arose for consideration before the 
Tribunal was whether the 1st respondent was liable to pay the 
reliability charge. The Tribunal noted that the 1st respondent 
is undisputedly a continuous process industry on express 
feeder and is not subjected to load-shedding. In paragraph 18 
of the impugned judgment, the Tribunal held that the tariff of 
HT continuous industries, like the 1st respondent, has been 
fixed at a higher rate than that of the tariff rate applicable for 
HT non-continuous industries. In the same paragraph, the 
Tribunal noted the admitted position that effective from 1st 
June 2008, the continuous industries (on express feeder) were 
paying tariff of 4.30 paisa per kWh and non-continuous 
industries (not on express feeder) were paying tariff at the rate 
of 3.95 paisa per kWh. From 1st August 2009, the rates were 
increased to 5.05 paisa kWh and 4.60 paisa kWh respectively. 
Therefore, the Appellate Tribunal held that the 1st respondent 
had already been subjected to higher tariffs than consumers 
on non-express feeders. Thus, the appellant has already been 
compensated for providing continuous supply to the industries 

            Civil Appeal No. 8413 of 2009 
      
 
 
 
          Page 5 of 6 
 
like the 1st respondent. The Tribunal also held that neither 
Section 62(3) of the 2013 Act nor the Rules and Regulations 
framed by the Commission support the levy of reliability 
charge. The appellant in this appeal is unable to show any 
basis in the Statute or Statutory rules and regulations to 
support the levy of a reliability charge.  
7. 
As regards the failure of the 1st respondent to object at 
the time of the public hearing, the Tribunal recorded a finding 
of fact that Vidharba Industries Association, of which the 1st 
respondent is a member, had raised an objection by filing an 
affidavit. There is no dispute about this factual aspect.  
8. 
Under Section 111 of the 2003 Act, a statutory appeal is 
provided against an order of the Commission. The remedy is 
available to any aggrieved person. It cannot be disputed that 
the 1st respondent was directly affected by the levy of the 
reliability charge. Hence, the first respondent was the person 
aggrieved within the meaning of Section 111. In the appeal, the 
appellant was entitled to challenge the legality of the impugned 
order of the Commission. Nothing in the 2003 Act suggests that 
a consumer who does not participate in the Commission's 
public hearing and is aggrieved by an order of the Commission 
is disentitled to prefer an appeal. 
9. 
The Tribunal has also noted that the appellant filed a 
Review Petition before the State Commission on 27 July 2009 
to determine an additional supply charge instead of a reliability 
charge for the withdrawal of load-shedding in the area.  
10. 
It is an admitted position that 1st respondent, a 
continuous process industry on express feeder, paid a higher 

            Civil Appeal No. 8413 of 2009 
      
 
 
 
          Page 6 of 6 
 
tariff during the relevant period of July 2009 to April 2010 to 
enable it to get supply without load-shedding.  
11. 
We find no error in the view taken by the Tribunal that 
the appellant was not entitled to impose a reliability charge on 
customers like the 1st respondent.  
12. 
Hence, we find no merit in the appeal, and the same is 
dismissed.
