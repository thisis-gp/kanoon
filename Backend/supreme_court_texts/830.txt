"Disability only becomes a tragedy when society fails to provide the things we 
need to lead our lives – job opportunities or barrier-free buildings. It is not a 
tragedy to me that I'm living in a wheelchair."

1. This judgment arises from a Writ Petition instituted in 2005 seeking directions 
to ensure meaningful access to public spaces for persons with disabilities1. On 
15 December 2017, this Court rendered a judgement containing directions to 
all the States and Union Territories with eleven action points. In view of the slow 
progress in complying with the judgement, this Court appointed the Centre for 
Disability Studies, NALSAR University of Law2 to assess the situation on the 
ground and recommend steps to ensure compliance with accessibility 
standards for PWDs. We write this judgment in view of the report submitted by 
NALSAR-CDS to this Court and the submissions filed by the petitioner on the 
next steps to be taken. Submissions have also been filed by the Union of India. 
 
A. Background 
i. 
Genesis of the proceedings  
2. The Petitioner, Rajive Raturi, is a visually challenged person who works with a 
human rights organisation. He instituted a Writ Petition before this Court in 2005 
seeking directions to the respondents to take certain measures towards 
ensuring safety and accessibility in public spaces, such as roads, public

transport and other facilities for visually challenged persons. At the time of filing 
the petition, the legislation governing the rights of persons with disabilities was 
the erstwhile Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of 
Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. The current framework is governed by 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016.3  
 
3. By a judgment dated 15th December 2017,4 this Court, speaking through 
Justice AK Sikri, identified eleven action points pursuant to the RPWD Act and 
the Accessible India Campaign for compliance. These action points pertained 
to the accessibility of a range of infrastructure, including government buildings, 
railways, airports, ICT ecosystem and transport carriers. The Union of India, all 
States and Union Territories were directed to file their compliance affidavits, and 
the case was re-listed after three months. Most of the States and Union 
Territories did not provide the required information and failed to file their 
compliance affidavits within the period of three months.   
 
4. This Court issued several orders directing the States and Union Territories to 
provide the requisite information with details of the status of completion and 
compliance reports. On 25 July 2018, this Court noted that while the Union of 
India had filed its affidavit, the response was not in accord with the directions in 
the 2017 judgement and “lacked material particulars”. This Court stipulated a 
format in which affidavits were to be filed by the Union of India, the States and 
the Union Territories.

5. On 15 January 2019, when the case was placed before a bench comprising 
Justice AK Sikri and Justice Abdul Nazeer, all the States and Union Territories 
had filed their affidavits. However, this Court noted that many States and Union 
Territories had not filed their affidavits in the stipulated format or provided 
incomplete information about all the targets; and in cases where information 
was provided, it was not complete as target dates were not mentioned. The 
Court took strong exception to this and opined: 
“More than a year has passed since the judgment 
was delivered The indifferent attitude of the States 
and the Union Territories shows that they are not 
serious in complying with the directions contained in 
the judgment. It may be recapitulated that the 
directions which were given in the judgment dated 
25.07.2018 are simply to the effect that provisions 
contained in the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as “the said Act”) 
by providing necessary facilities to the persons 
suffering from different disabilities, should be 
provided with. 
 
The said Act specifically makes provisions for these 
facilities. The said Act also sets down the timelines 
within which these are to be provided. It is in the 
consonance with the aforesaid provisions that 
directions were given in the judgment and order 
dated 15.12.2017 whereas the Parliament has 
passed an enactment which entitles the persons 
suffering from different disabilities to get the said 
facilities as a matter of right and the States and the 
Union Territories cannot shy away from giving these 
facilities to such persons.” 
 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
 
6. Accordingly, the States and Union Territories were granted a final opportunity to 
submit the complete information in the stipulated format within three weeks. 
This Court directed that the Chief Secretaries of States and Union Territories 
which do not comply with these instructions to be personally present on the next 

PART A  
Page 6 of 51 
 
date of hearing. This Court also noted that the Union of India had failed to 
submit a proper affidavit and granted an additional three weeks to comply, 
failing which the  Secretary of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment 
(Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disability) was directed to be 
personally present.  
 
7. This Court also recorded the prayers in an interlocutory application seeking 
certain facilities for visually handicapped lawyers in the High Courts and this 
Court.  All the High Courts and the Secretary General of this Court were directed 
to submit their response to the reliefs sought in the application before the next 
date of hearing.  
 
ii. 
Assignment to NALSAR-CDS 
 
8. On 29 November 2023, when the case was placed before this Court, it was 
noted that several orders had already been passed regarding the poor progress 
made by the Union, States and Union Territories in implementing the provisions 
of the RPWD Act. Therefore, this Court was of the view that a comprehensive 
exercise was necessary to assess the situation on the ground. Accordingly, the 
NALSAR-CDS was directed to submit a report on the steps required to be taken 
in accordance with the guidelines and the Accessible India Campaign to, inter 
alia, make all State and Central Government buildings, airports, railway 
stations, public transport carriers, all Government websites, all public 
documents and the ICT ecosystem fully accessible to PWDs. It was directed 
that the report be completed within six months and the Department of 

PART A

Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, Union Ministry of Social Justice and 
Empowerment cooperate with the NALSAR-CDS by providing necessary 
logistical assistance.  
 
9. On 12 January 2024, pursuant to an email sent by Professor Amita Dhanda, 
Head of the NALSAR-CDS, this Court noted that NALSAR-CDS had accepted 
the assignment. It was further directed that the expenses which are incurred by 
the NALSAR-CDS shall be borne by the Union Ministry of Justice and 
Empowerment, and all reimbursements shall be made within a fortnight of the 
submission of invoices. The head of the NALSAR-CDS was granted liberty to 
chalk out the modalities for implementing the work, including engaging requisite 
experts and field workers to carry out the exercise in the States and Union 
Territories.  
 
10. Pursuant to the directions of this Court, the NALSAR-CDS submitted its report, 
which is aptly titled “Finding Sizes for All: A Report on the Status of the Right to 
Accessibility in India” to this Court. The NALSAR-CDS conducted surveys, 
expert interviews and first-person accounts to prepare its report and document 
accessibility barriers across various spheres.  
 
11. Before discussing the NALSAR-CDS report, we will briefly discuss the 
underlying theoretical framework that governs the right to accessibility and 
gives it meaning.

B. Understanding Accessibility 
 
12. Accessibility refers to the design of products, services, environments, and 
systems to ensure that all individuals, including those with disabilities, can 
access, use, and benefit from them fully and independently. This encompasses 
physical access, such as entry to buildings and transport, as well as access to 
information, communication, and digital platforms. It is essential for promoting 
inclusion and enabling participation in all aspects of public life. 
 
13. The World Report on Disability published by the World Health Organization and 
World Bank stresses that inaccessibility within the built environment, transport 
systems, and communication channels severely limits the opportunities for 
PWDs to live fully in society.5 This inaccessibility leads to exclusion from 
education, employment, healthcare, and public services, effectively reinforcing 
the social and economic marginalisation of PWDs. Moreover, the lack of 
accessibility exacerbates inequalities, as it limits the ability of PWDs to engage 
in community life, and often results in dependence on others, restricting their 
autonomy and opportunities for self-determination. This, in turn, results in 
broader societal costs, as PWDs are often prevented from contributing to the 
workforce and society, thus perpetuating a cycle of poverty and isolation.  
 
 
 
5 World Health Organization and World Bank, World Report on Disability (2011). See Summary, pp. 10. 
The report provides the best available evidence about what works to overcome barriers to health care, 
rehabilitation, education, employment, and support services, and to create the environments which will 
enable people with disabilities to flourish.

i. 
International Framework on Accessibility 
 
14. The evolution of accessibility as a right has been influenced by progressive 
international legal standards, which recognise it as integral to the dignity, 
equality, and autonomy of PWDs.6 The recognition of accessibility within the 
international human rights context highlights its importance as a prerequisite for 
the enjoyment of a range of rights, fostering a shift from charity-based 
approaches to rights-based ones.7 
 
15. Accessibility is woven throughout the United Nations Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities 8 as a cross-cutting right, reinforcing its critical role 
in achieving social inclusion. It is highlighted in paragraph (e) of the Preamble, 
which calls for an environment that supports full personal development and 
societal participation.9 Article 3 sets out accessibility as a general principle, 
which highlights the necessity of removing both tangible and intangible barriers 
to ensure that PWDs can fully exercise their rights.10 These barriers can be 
physical, such as inaccessible buildings and transportation systems, or 
intangible, such as discriminatory attitudes or inaccessible digital content.  
 
 
6 Fréderic Mégrét, ‘The Disabilities Convention: Human Rights of Persons with Disabilities or Disability 
Rights?’, Human Rights Quarterly 30, no. 2 (2008): 507.  
7 Accessibility was a key element of the third goal of the World Programme of Action (WPA), titled 
‘Equalization of Opportunities,’ as outlined in UN General Assembly Resolution 37/52, adopted on 3 
December 1982. Another crucial document addressing the principle of accessibility is the UN Standard 
Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities, adopted by the UN General 
Assembly in 1993 under Resolution 48/96, passed on 20 December 1993. 
8 “CRPD”  
9 CRPD, Preamble para. (e) states as follows: ‘Recognizing the importance of accessibility to the 
physical, social, economic and cultural environment, to health and education and to information and 
communication, in enabling persons with disabilities to fully enjoy all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms’. 
10 CRPD, Article 3.   

PART B 
Page 10 of 51 
 
16. Article 9 of the CRPD11 is particularly significant as it sets out explicit obligations 
for States Parties to promote accessibility as an essential right.12 Article 9(1) 
mandates that States take proactive steps to ensure persons with disabilities 
have equal access to public spaces, transportation, information, communication 
systems, and services.13 This directive encompasses the development, 
implementation, and monitoring of standards and guidelines that promote 
access. Article 9(2)(a) elaborates on these obligations by detailing the areas 
that require targeted action, such as ensuring that the design and construction 
of buildings and public facilities adhere to universal design principles. 14 This 
commitment extends to digital spaces and information technologies, reflecting 
 
11 Article 9 reads:  
(1) To enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, 
States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an 
equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and 
communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other 
facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas. These measures, 
which shall include the identification and elimination of obstacles and barriers to accessibility, shall apply 
to, inter alia: 
a) Buildings, roads, transportation and other indoor and outdoor facilities, including schools, housing, 
medical facilities and workplaces; 
b) Information, communications and other services, including electronic services and emergency 
services. 
12 Referred to Francesco Seatzu, ‘Article 9 [Accessibility]’, in The United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities: A Commentary, ed. Valentina Della Fina, Rachele Cera and 
Giuseppe Palmisano (Cham: Springer, 2017), 229.  
13 CRPD, Article 9(1). 
14 CRPD, Article 9(2); States Parties shall also take appropriate measures: 
a) To develop, promulgate and monitor the implementation of minimum standards and guidelines for 
the accessibility of facilities and services open or provided to the public; 
b) To ensure that private entities that offer facilities and services which are open or provided to the 
public take into account all aspects of accessibility for persons with disabilities; 
c) To provide training for stakeholders on accessibility issues facing persons with disabilities; 
d) To provide in buildings and other facilities open to the public signage in Braille and in easy-to-read 
and understand forms; 
e) To provide forms of live assistance and intermediaries, including guides, readers and professional 
sign language interpreters, to facilitate accessibility to buildings and other facilities open to the public; 
f) To promote other appropriate forms of assistance and support to persons with disabilities to ensure 
their access to information; g) To promote access for persons with disabilities to new information and 
communications technologies and systems, including the Internet; 
h) To promote the design, development, production and distribution of accessible information and 
communications technologies and systems at an early stage, so that these technologies and systems 
become accessible at minimum cost.

the need for inclusive approaches in an increasingly digital world. Accessibility 
under this article is meant to influence both public and private sectors, 
encouraging a society where all members can participate without barriers.15 
 
17. Article 9 emphasises that accessibility requirements for urban and rural areas 
must be all-encompassing, ensuring that measures address the needs of 
diverse environments.16 While urban areas may exhibit more advanced 
infrastructure due to better resources and policy implementation, they can still 
present challenges such as intricate layouts, insufficiently accessible public 
transit, and overcrowded spaces that hinder movement. On the other hand, 
rural areas frequently face a scarcity of basic facilities, transport options, and 
services, creating substantial barriers for PWDs. Recognising these disparities, 
Article 9 requires States to tailor their accessibility strategies to suit the specific 
conditions of both urban and rural regions.  
 
18. International Principles and Guidelines on Access to Justice for Persons with 
Disabilities reinforce the critical role of accessibility within legal systems, 
embedding it as a non-negotiable aspect of justice.17 Principle 2 emphasizes 
that justice facilities and related services must be universally accessible, thus 
preventing discrimination and ensuring that all individuals, regardless of 
disability, can fully engage in legal processes.18 This includes adapting all 
modes of transportation within the justice framework to be accessible, allocating

financial resources for necessary infrastructure changes, and embedding 
accessibility in both physical and digital environments. Furthermore, these 
guidelines call for procedural accommodations such as the use of assistive 
technologies, sign language interpreters, and simplified formats for legal 
documentation to remove communication barriers.  
 
ii. 
Accessibility as a Human Right 
 
19. The right to accessibility is not a new or separate human right, but rather an 
integral part of existing human rights frameworks. Accessibility is embedded 
within several international human rights treaties, reinforcing its foundational 
role in ensuring equality and dignity for all individuals, including those with 
disabilities. For example, access to the physical environment and public 
transportation is essential for the realisation of freedom of movement, which is 
guaranteed under Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights19 and 
Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.20 Similarly, 
access to information and communication is crucial for exercising the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, as articulated in Article 19 of the UDHR. 
These rights are foundational for enabling PWDs to live independently, 
participate in society, and enjoy their rights on an equal basis with others. 21

14 on the Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health, UN Doc. E/C.12/2000/4, para. 12, 2000.  

PART B 
Page 13 of 51 
 
20. The European Economic and Social Committee22, in its 2014 Opinion on 
Accessibility as a Human Right for Persons with Disabilities, recognized that 
Article 9 of the CRPD represents a human right in itself.23 The EESC stated that 
accessibility is a crucial prerequisite for ensuring the full enjoyment of civil, 
political, economic, social, and cultural rights for PWDs. 24 
 
21. The accessibility norm, as articulated in Article 9 of the CRPD, mandates that 
all individuals with disabilities have equal access to facilities, goods, and 
services, providing them with essential entitlements to ensure they can fully 
engage with and contribute to society.25 This framing situates accessibility as 
an essential human right that is indispensable for the realisation of broader 
social, economic, and political rights.  
 
22. Accessibility is not merely a convenience, but a fundamental requirement for 
enabling individuals, particularly those with disabilities, to exercise their rights 
fully and equally. Without accessibility, individuals are effectively excluded from 
many aspects of society, whether that be education, employment, healthcare, 
or participation in cultural and civic activities. Accessibility ensures that persons 
with disabilities are not marginalised but are instead able to enjoy the same 
opportunities as everyone else, making it an integral part of ensuring equality, 
freedom, and human dignity. By embedding accessibility as a human right

within existing legal frameworks, it becomes clear that it is an essential 
prerequisite for the exercise of other rights.   
 
iii. 
Accessibility Jurisprudence  
 
23. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has consistently 
highlighted accessibility as a key issue in its dialogues with State parties 
reviewing their initial reports. Accessibility has also been a focal point in 
jurisprudence. In the case of Szilvia Nyusti, Péter Takács and Tamás 
Fazekas v. Hungary26, the Committee emphasized that all public services must 
be accessible in accordance with Article 9 of the CRPD. The State party was 
specifically urged to ensure that blind individuals could access automatic teller 
machines (ATMs). 
 
24. Similarly, the European Court of Human Rights27 has recognized the 
importance of accessibility in its judgments, ruling that public buildings should 
be equipped with facilities for PWDs. 28 In 2022,  EtCHR in Lárusson v. Iceland 
recognized that accessibility falls within the scope of Article 8 of the European 
Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and 
family life. 29 The case involved the lack of accessibility to cultural event venues 
in the applicant’s municipality, which hindered his participation in cultural and

a town that was not his hometown.

social activities, including attending events with his children.30 The Court 
acknowledged that accessibility is essential for individuals with disabilities to 
live independently and fully participate in society. 31 The lack of accessibility 
affected the applicant's personal development and ability to form relationships.  
 
25. In Indian jurisprudence, several significant decisions have addressed 
accessibility within the built environment. This court in a catena of decisions has 
reinforced the principle of accessibility in public infrastructure. In Disabled 
Rights Group v. Union of India32, this Court directed all educational 
institutions run or aided by the Government to comply with their obligation to 
reserve 5% seats for the disabled and directed them to report their compliance 
with the same to authorities set up under the Act.33 This court also directed the 
setting up of a committee to suggest measures on how the physical 
infrastructure and methods of pedagogy adopted by educational institutions can 
be made accessible to the disabled within the stipulated time frame. 
 
26. Similarly, Justice A K Sikri in the 2017 Judgment grounded the right to 
accessibility in the fundamental rights chapter of the Constitution, emphasizing 
that access to public spaces and services is an essential aspect of the right to 
life and dignity. This Court observed:  
“The vitality of the issue of accessibility vis-à-vis visually disabled 
person’s right to life can be gauged clearly by the Supreme 
Court’s judgement in State of Himachal Pradesh v Umed Ram 
Sharma (1986) where the right to life under Article 21 has been 
held broad enough to incorporate the right to accessibility.”

32 Disabled Right Group v Union of India [2018] 2 SCC 397. 
33 Ibid.  

PART C 
Page 16 of 51 
 
27. The inclusion of accessibility within the fundamental rights framework ensures 
that PWDs are entitled to full participation in society under Articles 14, 19, and 
21 of the Constitution. Article 14 upholds equal access to spaces, services, and 
information; Article 19 guarantees the freedom to move and express oneself; 
and Article 21 ensures the right to live with dignity. Together, these provisions 
guarantee not only formal equality but also substantive equality, which requires 
the state to take positive steps to ensure that individuals can enjoy their rights 
fully, irrespective of disabilities. This Court in a plethora of judgments has 
repeatedly recognized that the right to dignity and the right to a meaningful life 
under Article 21 necessitate conditions that enable PWDs to enjoy the same 
freedoms and choices as others.34 Thus, the right to accessibility is 
foundational, enabling PWDs to exercise and benefit from other rights 
enshrined in Part III of the Constitution.   
C. Reaffirming Disability as a Social Model: Two-Pronged Approach 
 
28. The Social Model of Disability challenges the traditional understanding of 
disability, which often views it through the lens of the Medical Model. In the 
Medical Model, disability is seen as an individual problem or impairment that 
needs to be treated or fixed. However, the Social Model, introduced by disabled 
academic Mike Oliver in 1983, shifts the focus from the person’s condition to 
the barriers they face in society.35 It argues that disability is not inherent in the 
 
34 See Jeeja Ghosh v Union of India 2016 INSC 412; Rajive Raturi v Union of India 2017 INSC 1243; 
Ravinder Kumar Dhariwal v Union of India 2021 INSC 916; Vikash Kumar v Union Public Service 
Commission 2021 INSC 78.  
35 On the social model generally, see Michael Oliver, ‘If I had a Hammer’, in Implementing the Social 
Model of Disability: Theory and Research, ed. Colin Barnes and Geof Mercer (Leeds: The Disability 
Press 2004), 18–31.

person, but is created by external factors such as physical, organizational, and 
attitudinal barriers. These barriers prevent full participation in society and can 
be removed through societal change, promoting inclusion and equality for 
PWDs.  
 
29. The Social Model directly relates to the concept of accessibility. By focusing on 
removing societal barriers rather than "fixing" individuals, it advocates for 
accessible environments, services, and opportunities. 
 
i. 
Integrating a Universal and Inclusive Model of Design  
 
30. The goal of universal design is to create products and environments that are 
usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for 
adaptation or specialised design.36 Universal design emphasizes the 
importance of creating environments, services, and products that can be 
accessed by everyone, regardless of their ability, age, or status. This approach 
is rooted in the belief that inclusion should be integrated into the design process 
from the very beginning, rather than as an afterthought. 
 
31. Universal or inclusive design goes beyond just making things accessible; it 
encourages creative and imaginative engagement with the diverse needs of all 
users. This means considering not only physical accessibility but also 
addressing social, informational, and technological barriers. The objective is to 
 
36 The 7 Principles of Universal Design were developed in 1997 by a working group of architects, product 
designers, engineers and environmental design researchers in North Carolina State University (NCSU). 

PART C 
Page 18 of 51 
 
eliminate environments that disable people and replace them with enabling 
ones for everyone. 
 
32. The RPWD Act and the CRPD both define "universal design" in similar terms. 
Under Section 2(ze) of the RPWD Act, universal design refers to the creation 
of products, environments, and services that are usable by everyone, to the 
greatest extent possible, without the need for specialised adaptation.37 This 
also includes assistive devices and advanced technologies for specific groups 
of PWDs. The CRPD expands its scope to include the necessity of assistive 
devices for those who need them.38 
 
33. When considering the design of products and services, it is crucial to account 
for environmental and structural factors that impact accessibility. For example, 
transportation systems must be designed with features that cater to various 
needs - whether through accessible vehicles, infrastructure, or communication 
systems. These factors play a critical role in ensuring that all individuals, 
including those with disabilities, can engage fully with public services and 
transportation. 
ii. 
A two-pronged approach to accessibility  
 
34. Addressing accessibility requires a balanced approach that focuses on both 
adapting existing environments and proactively designing new spaces with 
 
37 Right of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, Section 2(ze). “universal design” means the design of 
products, environments, programmes and services to be usable by all people to the greatest extent 
possible, without the need for adaptation or specialised design and shall apply to assistive devices 
including advanced technologies for particular group of persons with disabilities. 
38 CRPD, Article 2. “Universal design” shall not exclude assistive devices for particular groups of 
persons with disabilities where this is needed.

accessibility in mind. A two-pronged approach is needed - one that focuses 
on ensuring accessibility in existing institutions/activities and the other 
that focuses on transforming new infrastructure and future initiatives. Both 
are essential to achieving true inclusivity in society. 
 
35. The first prong focuses on ensuring that existing institutions and activities 
are made accessible and inclusive for all. This approach emphasizes the 
importance of retrofitting existing systems and structures to meet the needs of 
PWDs, women, older individuals, children, and other vulnerable groups. While 
retrofitting is important, it is often more complex and expensive than designing 
inclusive spaces from the outset. 
 
36. The second prong is about transforming infrastructure - rethinking and 
redesigning physical spaces to accommodate PWDs. This transformation 
involves reimagining public spaces, transportation, educational institutions, and 
other facilities to ensure that accessibility is embedded from the very beginning, 
rather than retrofitted later. When introducing any new service, product, or 
feature - whether physical or functional - accessibility must be considered at the 
inception stage. It is far more efficient to integrate accessibility from the start 
than to make adjustments later. By embedding universal design principles into 
the core of our systems, processes, and infrastructure, we can ensure that they 
are usable by all, making inclusivity a foundational element rather than an 
afterthought.

iii. 
Reasonable Accommodation and Accessibility  
 
37. At this stage, it is also crucial to understand the relationship between 
reasonable accommodation and accessibility, as both are essential for 
achieving equality for PWDs. While accessibility generally refers to the removal 
of barriers in the environment or infrastructure to ensure equal access for all, 
reasonable accommodation is more individualised.39 It involves making specific 
adjustments to meet the unique needs of a person with a disability. In other 
words, accessibility ensures that environments are designed to be inclusive 
from the outset, while reasonable accommodation ensures that individuals who 
face specific challenges can enjoy their rights on an equal basis in particular 
contexts. 
 
38. As highlighted by the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 
General Comment 6, reasonable accommodation is integral to the principle of 
inclusive equality, acting as a facilitator for substantive equality.40 The General 
Comment articulated the relationship between reasonable accommodation and 
accessibility as follows:  
“22. Accessibility is related to groups, whereas 
reasonable accommodation is related to individuals. 
This means that the duty to provide accessibility is 
an ex ante duty. States parties therefore have the 
duty to provide accessibility before receiving an 
individual request to enter or use a place or service. 
States parties need to set accessibility standards, 
which must be negotiated with organizations of 
persons with disabilities, and they need to be

Disabilities and Non-Discrimination in Employment: Rising to the Challenges?’, in Disability Law and 
Policy: An Analysis of the UN Convention, ed. Charles O’Mahony and Gerard Quinn (Dublin: Clarus 
Press, 2017), 366.

specified for service-providers, builders and other 
relevant stakeholders. Accessibility standards must 
be broad and standardized. In the case of 
individuals who have rare impairments that were not 
taken into account when the accessibility standards 
were developed or do not use the modes, methods 
or means offered to achieve accessibility (not 
reading Braille print, for example), even the 
application of disability standards may not be 
sufficient to ensure them access. In such cases, 
reasonable accommodation may apply.  
 
23. 
The 
duty 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
accommodation is an ex nunc duty, which means 
that it is enforceable from the moment an individual 
with an impairment needs it in a given situation 
(workplace, school, etc.) in order to enjoy her or his 
rights on an equal basis in a particular context. Here, 
accessibility standards can be an indicator, but may 
not 
be 
taken 
as 
prescriptive. 
Reasonable 
accommodation can be used as a means of 
ensuring accessibility for an individual with a 
disability in a particular situation. Reasonable 
accommodation seeks to achieve individual justice 
in the sense that non-discrimination or equality is 
assured, taking the dignity, autonomy and choices 
of the individual into account. Thus, a person with a 
rare impairment might ask for accommodation that 
falls outside the scope of any accessibility standard. 
The decision to provide it or not depends on whether 
it is reasonable and whether it imposes a 
disproportionate or undue burden.” 
 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
 
 
39. It is crucial to reiterate that accessibility is an ex-ante duty, meaning that the 
State is required to implement accessibility measures proactively, before an 
individual even requests to enter or use a place or service. This proactive 
responsibility ensures that accessibility is embedded in the infrastructure and 
services from the outset. The State must establish broad, standardised 
accessibility standards in consultation with disability organizations, ensuring 
that these standards are enforced by service providers, builders, and all 

PART C 
Page 22 of 51 
 
relevant stakeholders. The state cannot negate its duty to accessibility by 
relying solely on existing standards or waiting for individual requests. For 
example, inaccessible information for a person with intellectual disabilities 
would require reasonable accommodation (such as a verbal explanation), 
whereas accessible information (e.g., in an easy-read format) would eliminate 
the need for such accommodation.41 
 
40. In such cases, reasonable accommodation may be necessary only as a 
complementary measure to ensure equal access. The duty to accommodate 
plays an important role in enabling people with disabilities to challenge 
accessibility barriers in particular, individualised cases. Compliance with the 
reasonable accommodation duty for one individual with a disability can, in turn, 
enhance the overall accessibility of structures for all people.  
 
41. In Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service Commission,42 this Court also 
highlighted that reasonable accommodation must consider not only the benefit 
to the individual but also to others in similar situations in the future. Accessibility 
and reasonable accommodation require a departure from the status quo and 
that challenges in implementing such measures should not be seen as barriers 
to inclusion. Complications in implementation are inevitable, but they should not 
be used as an excuse to deny accommodations.
 
 
 
41 There is a ‘close and mutually reinforcing relationship’ between reasonable accommodation and 
accessibility measures; See further Anna Lawson, ‘Reasonable Accommodation and Accessibility 
Obligations: Towards a More Unified European Approach?’, European Anti-Discrimination Law 
Review 11 (2011): 11–21.  
42 Vikash Kumar v Union Public Service Commission, 2021 INSC 78.  

PART D 
Page 23 of 51 
 
42. The RPWD Act and international frameworks such as the CRPD emphasize 
that accessibility should be built into systems and infrastructure from the outset. 
However, where this is not enough, reasonable accommodation comes into 
play to tailor solutions to individual needs. This dual approach ensures that all 
individuals, regardless of their impairments, have equal opportunities and 
access to participate fully in society. Both accessibility and reasonable 
accommodation 
must 
therefore 
be 
seen 
as 
interdependent 
and 
complementary, each reinforcing the other in the pursuit of full inclusion and 
equality.  
 
43. From the above, the following guiding principles emerge:  
a. Accessibility is not a standalone right; it is a prerequisite for PWDs to 
exercise other rights meaningfully; and   
b. Accessibility requires a two-pronged approach. One focuses on ensuring 
accessibility in existing institutions/activities often through retrofitting and 
the other focuses on transforming new infrastructure and future initiatives.  
 
D. NALSAR Report and its findings: Sector Wise 
 
44.  Having discussed the theoretical framework to understand accessibility, we will 
now briefly summarise the NALSAR-CDS Report. The NALSAR-CDS 
employed the following methodology in preparing its report:  
a. The NALSAR-CDS reached out to the Union and State governments, Union 
Territories, court administrations, and prison establishments to gather 
details on their accessibility initiatives. Responses were received from only 

PART D 
Page 24 of 51 
 
fourteen States, three Union Territories and the Union Ministry of Social 
Justice and Empowerment. The remaining fourteen States and five Union 
Territories did not respond;  
b. NALSAR-CDS also gathered individual affidavits from PWDs, including 
those whose impairments were not covered by the RPWD Act Schedule. 
The studies and surveys conducted were undertaken by individuals and 
organisations using their own resources;  
c. Expertise and lived experiences of PWDs were central to the report. Various 
organizations conducted surveys on the right to education, transportation, 
and sports to assess how access impacts these rights. Law students 
contributed by auditing accessibility in Mumbai;  
d. To understand the impact of the existing accessibility guidelines, NALSAR-
CDS conducted interviews with accessibility experts and organised focused 
group discussions with doctors with disabilities. Additionally, expert opinions 
were sought on how access affects higher education, and personal 
testimonies were included to reflect the lived experiences of PWDs;  
e. A draft of the report was shared for feedback with all contributors, ensuring 
accountability and recognition of their inputs; and 
f. The report was prepared using personal resources, and no financial claims 
have been made to the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.  
45. It is now necessary to look at the findings of the report. The report mentions 
that the 2021 Harmonising Guidelines marked a significant shift by including a 
chapter on "Accessibility, Diversity and Universal Design," broadening the focus 
to address all impairments and recognizing accessibility needs for groups 

PART D 
Page 25 of 51 
 
beyond individuals with disabilities, such as children, the elderly, and those 
temporarily disabled. However, the guidelines only briefly covered less-
discussed disabilities. The NALSAR-CDS documented these gaps through 
affidavits from individuals with conditions like autism, cerebral palsy, and 
ichthyosis.43 For example, individuals with autism emphasized the benefit of 
subsidized communication devices, while those with cerebral palsy highlighted 
the need for a register of scribes.  
 
46. The report explored the intersectional nature of the right to accessibility, aiming 
to demonstrate its impact on the enjoyment of other rights. It emphasised that 
the right to accessibility cannot be viewed in isolation but must be considered 
alongside other forms of disadvantage, such as caste, sex, region, and religion. 
The report also stressed the importance of addressing the compounded 
discrimination that arises when disability intersects with these other factors. It 
called for a more inclusive approach that takes into account the multiple 
dimensions of vulnerability and disadvantage, ensuring that policies and 
practices do not overlook these intersections. 
 
47. The report pointed out that inaccessibility often leads to compounded 
discrimination, creating additional layers of disadvantage for PWDs, particularly 
when these individuals are also subject to other forms of marginalisation. The 
findings emphasised the need for a comprehensive and intersectional approach 
to accessibility that recognizes and addresses these overlapping challenges.  
 
43 Ability Development and Inclusion (AADI), Muskaan, Action for Autism, National Platform for the 
Rights of the Disabled, and Surbhi Meshram facilitated the filing of affidavits by individuals with cerebral 
palsy, intellectual disabilities, autism, and sickle cell disease.  

PART D 
Page 26 of 51 
 
 
48. The report found the following with regard to compliance in various sectors:  
a. Accessibility in Courts – NALSAR- CDS engaged Ms. Roma Bhagat and 
Associates for a pilot survey assessing accessibility in all High Courts. No 
responses were received from the High Courts of Allahabad (both at 
Allahabad and Lucknow), Madhya Pradesh (all benches), and Jammu and 
Kashmir and Ladakh (Srinagar). The Madras High Court (Madurai Bench) 
replied after the data analysis, and Delhi High Court data remained 
unvalidated. Out of thirty High Court benches analysed, findings showed 
that accessibility for locomotor disabilities was relatively better. 44 However, 
only two courts had tactile guiding strips and interpreters for the hearing 
impaired. Awareness for intellectual and developmental disabilities stood at 
just 6.6%. The report also referenced a separate study by Mr Rajesh Deoli 
on accessibility within the courts of Uttarakhand, highlighting additional 
challenges and needs. Moreover, suggestions provided by Mission 
Accessibility were also noted, offering recommendations on how courts 
could be made more accessible for all individuals, including those with 
disabilities.45 
b. Accessibility in Prisons - The report found that most states claimed to 
provide wheelchairs, crutches, Western toilets, prosthetics, and medical 
referrals to civil hospitals, with some offering special diets and counselling. 
However, these facilities were mainly available in central and women's

PART D 
Page 27 of 51 
 
prisons, while district and sub-jails were less equipped. Key systemic issues 
identified include several shortcomings. First, many states do not officially 
recognize all categories of disabilities as defined in the RPWD Act, leading 
to underreporting and insufficient provision of services. Second, District and 
Sub Jails are significantly underserved. Third, there is a severe shortage of 
mental 
health 
professionals 
in 
prisons. 
While 
at 
least 
1,146 
psychologists/psychiatrists should be employed, only 69 positions have 
been sanctioned, and just 25 are filled.46 
c. Accessibility in Educational institutions - A survey involving 947 parents 
of children with disabilities across twenty three states highlighted significant 
educational access challenges.47 While 56% of children were enrolled in 
primary classes, enrolment dropped sharply in higher grades. Notably, 4% 
never attended school despite being enrolled, due to reasons like schools 
asking them not to come or inaccessible transport. Only 2% of students 
could access school toilets, and many could not participate in assemblies 
or receive mid-day meals. Just 17% were provided with learning materials 
and 64% faced barriers due to inaccessible formats. These issues 
contribute to children with disabilities feeling marginalized and overlooked, 
even when physically present in schools. 
d. Accessibility in Employment – NALSAR-CDS relied upon a report from 
Enable India which highlights barriers to employment for PWDs, including 
those with benchmark disabilities and high support needs.48 These barriers

Page 28 of 51 
 
occur both pre- and post-employment and vary based on geographic 
location and the nature of impairments. Key barriers include inaccessible 
job portals, lack of accessible educational facilities, and inconsistent 
implementation of accessibility standards. Specific issues for various 
impairments include: 
1) Visual impairments: Inaccessible job portals and complex application 
processes;  
2) Hearing and speech impairments: Lack of sign language recognition 
and inaccessible application methods;  
3) Locomotor disabilities: Physical infrastructure barriers and non-
compliance with accessibility standards;  
4) Neurodevelopmental disorders and learning disabilities: Rigid 
selection criteria and inaccessible assessment methods;  
5) Multiple disabilities: Need for inclusive recruitment processes and 
practical assessments;  
6) Acid attack survivors: Attitudinal barriers and lack of sensitization. 
e. Accessibility in Buildings and Transport - The report emphasizes that 
freedom of movement, a fundamental right, relies on both accessible 
transport and buildings. Accessibility in transport is essential for disabled 
individuals to access education, employment, healthcare, and social 
participation. For example, in Delhi, 3,775 low-floor CNG buses make 
transport accessible to wheelchair users, whereas Tamil Nadu has only 

PART D 
Page 29 of 51 
 
1,917 accessible buses out of 21,669.49 Accessible transport, such as 
buses with audio systems, enhances daily activities like healthcare 
appointments for visually impaired individuals. In contrast, inaccessible 
infrastructure, such as pothole-filled footpaths, hinders mobility and safety. 
In terms of building accessibility, a study by Dr Suman Kalani on Mumbai's 
infrastructure found mixed results.50 Newer facilities, like Andheri Metro 
Station, meet accessibility standards, but older buildings, such as the 
Bombay Art Gallery, lack basic features like accessible restrooms. This 
disparity affects the ability of disabled individuals to move freely and access 
opportunities. For example, the Andheri Metro Station provides 
independent commuting, while the inaccessible entrance of Krishna Curve 
Shopping Mall in Santa Cruz limits business and employment opportunities 
for PWDs.  
f. Right to form relationships - The report highlights the emotional and 
relational challenges faced by PWDs, particularly regarding access to love, 
desire, and intimacy. Abhishek Annica, a disability activist, emphasized that 
disabled life is often lonely and alienating, with public discourse on 
accessibility ignoring private, intimate needs like access to sex and 
relationships.51 Emotional needs, such as privacy and self-pleasure, are 
often overlooked, leaving disabled individuals, especially those living with 
families, without private spaces to express these needs.

g. Right to Health - In the realm of health, significant barriers persist for PWDs 
in accessing healthcare, primarily due to the medical establishment's 
pathologizing view of disabled bodies and minds. A panel discussion 
highlighted the positive impact of having doctors with disabilities in the 
healthcare system.52 However, disabled individuals still face significant 
obstacles in becoming healthcare professionals and obtaining necessary 
accommodations. Studies have revealed that many healthcare services 
lack proper accessibility, and healthcare professionals are often untrained 
in accommodating the needs of disabled individuals. A Survey by National 
Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People found that 
healthcare infrastructure is frequently not designed with accessibility in 
mind, which hinders the ability of disabled people to receive timely and 
appropriate care.  
h. Participation in Sports - In sports, accessibility remains a major issue. 
Only 21.4% of surveyed sports facilities had fully accessible restrooms, with 
just 3.6% providing sensory rooms for athletes with sensory processing 
disorders.53 89.3% of these venues lacked assistive listening systems. 
Additionally, communication accessibility was limited, with only 7.1% of 
locations offering captioning or sign language interpretation. When it comes 
to digital access, only 25% of sports websites were fully accessible, and 
merely 7.1% of apps met accessibility standards.

i. Political Participation - while temporary accessibility measures like ramps 
are erected during elections, these are removed afterwards, leading to 
inconsistent access.54 The report stresses the importance of permanent 
solutions, such as permanent ramps and facilities, to ensure reliable and 
ongoing accessibility for PWDs, enabling them to fully exercise their right to 
vote. 
E. Inconsistencies in the Existing Legal Framework  
 
49. In addition to reporting on inadequate accessibility measures in various 
spheres, as summarised above, NALSAR-CDS has reported that there is an 
inconsistency in the legal framework, which lies at the root of the slow progress. 
The report states that while the RPWD Act creates a mechanism for mandatory 
compliance with a set of non-negotiable accessibility rules, the Right of Persons 
with Disabilities Rules, 201755 create a mechanism which only prescribes self-
regulatory guidelines. Therefore, the report states, that Rule 15 of the RPWD 
Rules, which contains the accessibility standards, is ultra vires the RPWD Act. 
Further, it is contended that the situation on the ground reveals that the absence 
of non-negotiable rules and excessive reliance on guidelines, compromises the 
effective realisation of accessibility rights.   
 
50. With regard to this contention, Mr Colin Gonsalves, Senior Counsel for the 
petitioner submitted that Rule 15 of the RPWD Rules uses the term “shall” and 
thus, all the standards prescribed under the RPWD Rules are in fact mandatory. 
 
54 Disability Rights Alliance -Accessibility in Eiections-2024  
 
55 “RPWD Rules”  

PART E 
Page 32 of 51 
 
He seeks a declaration from this Court to the effect that Rule 15 and the various 
standards prescribed in the rule are mandatory. This entails, according to Mr 
Gonsalves, that new establishments which do not comply with the standards 
under Rule 15 cannot get clearances and old establishments must be 
mandatorily retrofitted in accordance with these rules. Mr Vikramajit Banerjee, 
the learned Additional Solicitor General, also conceded that Rule 15 read with 
Sections 44 to 46 of the RPWD Act prescribes a mandatory compliance 
framework. The Union has also filed written submissions detailing the various 
steps taken to comply with the standards prescribed in Rule 15 and towards the 
targets in the Accessible India Campaign. These submissions have been taken 
on record along with the compliance affidavits filed by the States and Union 
Territories. In the following section, we analyse the alleged inconsistency in the 
legal framework.  
 
i. 
Accessibility provisions in the RPWD Act and Rules 
 
a. RPWD Act 
 
51. The RPWD Act came into force on 19 April 2017.56 The long title of the Act 
states that it is “An Act to give effect to the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and for matters connected therewith and 
incidental thereto”.  
 
 
56 Notification No. S.O. 1215(E)  

PART E 
Page 33 of 51 
 
52. Chapter VIII pertains to the ‘Duties and Responsibilities of Appropriate 
Governments’. The term “appropriate government” has been defined in Section 
2(b).57 Section 39 imposes an obligation on the appropriate government, in 
consultation with the Chief Commissioner or State Commissioner, to conduct, 
encourage, support or promote awareness campaigns and sensitisation 
programmes in relation to the protection of the rights of PWDs.  
 
53. Section 40 pertains to “Accessibility” and states that the Central Government, 
shall, in consultation with the Chief Commissioner, formulate rules for “persons 
with disabilities laying down the standards of accessibility for physical 
environment, transportation, information and communication including 
appropriate technologies and systems, and other facilities and services 
provided to the public in urban and rural areas.” The word “shall” indicates that 
the Central Government is mandated to make rules laying down the standards 
of accessibility. Section 40 must be read with Section 100 of the Act, which 
prescribes the power of the Central Government to make rules.  
 
54. Section 41 deals with one aspect of accessibility, namely, ‘access to transport’. 
Sub-section (1) states that the appropriate government shall take suitable 
measures to provide: 
 
57 Section 2(b) states: “(b) “appropriate Government” means, —  
(i) in relation to the Central Government or any establishment wholly or substantially financed by that 
Government, or a Cantonment Board constituted under the Cantonments Act, 2006 (41 of 2006), the 
Central Government;  
(ii) in relation to a State Government or any establishment, wholly or substantially financed by that 
Government, or any local authority, other than a Cantonment Board, the State Government.” 
 

PART E 
Page 34 of 51 
 
a. facilities for PWDs at bus stops, railway stations and airports conforming 
to the accessibility standards relating to parking spaces, toilets, ticketing 
counters and ticketing machines;  
b. access to all modes of transport that conform to the design standards, 
including retrofitting old modes of transport, wherever technically feasible 
and safe for PWDs, economically viable and without entailing major 
structural changes in design; and 
c. accessible roads to address mobility necessary for persons with 
disabilities. 
Sub-section (2) mandates that the appropriate government develop schemes 
and programmes to promote the personal mobility of PWDs at an affordable 
cost to provide for incentives and concessions, retrofitting of vehicles, and 
personal mobility assistance.  
 
55. Sections 42 and 43 pertain to “information and communication technology” and 
“consumer goods”, respectively. Section 42 mandates that the appropriate 
government take measures to ensure that:  
a. all contents available in audio, print and electronic media are in accessible 
format;  
b. PWDs have access to electronic media by providing audio description, sign 
language interpretation and close captioning; 
c. electronic goods and equipment which are meant for everyday use are 
available in universal design.  

PART E 
Page 35 of 51 
 
Section 43 stipulates that the appropriate government shall take measures to 
promote the development, production, and distribution of universally designed 
consumer products and accessories for general use of PWDs.  
 
56. Section 44 deals with the mandatory observance of the accessibility rules 
framed by the Central Government under Section 40 and the consequence of 
non-compliance. Sub-section (1) states that no establishment shall be granted 
permission to build any structure if the building plan does not adhere to the rules 
formulated by the Central Government under Section 40. Sub-section (2) 
stipulates that no establishment shall be issued a certificate of completion or 
allowed to take occupation of a building unless it has adhered to the rules 
formulated by the Central Government. Therefore, at both stages – when the 
building plan is made and at the stage of completion – mandatory adherence to 
the accessibility rules is envisaged by the Act.  
 
57. While Section 44 deals with mandatory compliance with the accessibility rules 
for all new buildings, Section 45 deals with the “retrofitting” of existing public 
buildings to comply with the accessibility rules within a prescribed time period, 
subject to extensions on a case-by-case basis. Section 45 stipulates that all 
existing public buildings shall be made accessible in accordance with the rules 
formulated by the Central Government within a period not exceeding five years 
from the date of notification of such rules. The proviso to sub-section (1) allows 
the Central Government to grant an extension of time to the States on a case-
to-case basis for adherence with this provision depending on their state of 
preparedness and other related parameters. Sub-section (2) states that the 

PART E 
Page 36 of 51 
 
appropriate government and the local authorities shall formulate and publish an 
action plan based on prioritisation, for providing accessibility in all their buildings 
and spaces providing essential services such as all primary health centres, civil 
hospitals, schools, railway stations and bus stops.  
 
58. Section 46 pertains to the time limit for compliance with the accessibility rules 
by service providers. It stipulates that all service providers – both Government 
and private – shall provide services in accordance with the rules on accessibility 
within a period of two years from the date of notification of such rules. The 
proviso to the provision states that the Central Government, in consultation with 
the Chief Commissioner may grant an extension of time for providing certain 
categories of services in accordance with the accessibility rules.  
 
59. Section 89 prescribes punishment for contravention of provisions of the RPWD 
Act or its allied rules. It states that any person who contravenes any of the 
provisions of the RPWD Act or rules made thereunder shall be liable to pay a 
fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees for the first contravention, and a 
fine which shall not be less than fifty thousand rupees but which may extend to 
five lakh rupees, for subsequent contraventions.  
b. Chapter VI the RPWD Rules  
 
60. The RPWD Rules, issued by the Central Government, came into force on 15 
June 2017.58 At the heart of the issue before this Court lies Chapter VI of the 
 
58 Notification No. G.S.R. 591 (E). 

PART E 
Page 37 of 51 
 
RPWD Rules, which is titled “Accessibility”. Rule 15, in its original form, read as 
follows: 
“15. Rules for Accessibility. - (1) Every 
establishment shall comply with the following 
standards 
relating 
to 
physical 
environment, 
transport and information and communication 
technology, namely:-  
 
(a) standard for public buildings as specified in the 
Harmonised Guidelines and Space Standards for 
Barrier Free Built Environment for Persons With 
Disabilities and Elderly Persons as issued by the 
Government 
of 
India, 
Ministry 
of 
Urban 
Development in March, 2016;  
 
(b) standard for Bus Body Code for transportation 
system as specified in the notification of the 
Government of India in the Ministry of Road 
Transport and Highways, vide number G.S.R. 
895(E), dated the 20th September, 2016;  
 
(c) Information and Communication Technology-

Department of Administrative Reforms and Public 
Grievances, Government of India;  
(ii) documents to be placed on websites shall be in 
Electronic Publication (ePUB) or Optical Character 
Reader (OCR) based pdf format:  
 
Provided that the standard of accessibility in respect 
of other services and facilities shall be specified by 
the Central Government within a period of six 
months from the date of notification of these rules.  
 
(2) The respective Ministries and Departments shall 
ensure compliance of the standards of accessibility 
specified under this rule through the concerned 
domain regulators or otherwise.”  
 
61. Rule 15(1) provides that every establishment shall comply with the standards 
relating to the physical environment, transport and information and 
communication technology, prescribed in the subsequent clauses of the 

PART E 
Page 38 of 51 
 
provision. Barring the requirement in Rule 15(1)(c)(ii) which requires that the 
documents on websites be in ePUB or OCR-based pdf format, all the other 
clauses in Rule 15(1) refer to documents/guidelines issued by various Ministries 
of the Union Government. Originally, these prescribed ‘standards’ were: 
a. For public buildings – Harmonised Guidelines and Space Standards for 
Barrier-Free Built Environment for Persons With Disabilities and Elderly 
Persons issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Urban Development 
in March 2016; [Original Clause (a) of Rule 15(1)]

64. Therefore, at present there is a list of seventeen documents prescribed in 
clauses (a) to (p) of Rule 15(1), which comprise the “accessibility rules” that 
shall be complied with in accordance with the RPWD Act. Further, the 
Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities states on its website 
that more standards of accessibility are in the pipeline, and are to be included 
in Rule 15 after necessary steps are taken by the concerned ministries. These 
include (i) Accessibility Guidelines for Bus Terminals and Bus Stops from the 
Ministry of Road Transport and Highways; (ii) Accessible Tourism Guidelines for 
India from the Ministry of Tourism; (iii) Accessibility Standards for TV 
programmes for hearing and visually impaired from the Ministry of Information 
and Broadcasting; and (iv) Accessibility guidelines for pension, other financial 
institutions and insurance sector from the Department of Financial Service.  
 
65. Rule 16 mandates a review of accessibility standards, and states that the 
Central Government shall review from time to time the accessibility standards 
based on the “latest scientific knowledge and technology”.  
 
ii. 
Inconsistency between Rule 15 and the RPWD Act  
 
 
66.  The RPWD Act creates a mandatory compliance mechanism with regard to 
accessibility rules. Section 40 states that the Central Government “shall” frame 
rules which lay down the standards of accessibility. Sections 44, 45, 46 and 89 
indicate that these rules are mandatory, provide timelines for compliance, and 
prescribe consequences for non-compliance. Section 44 stipulates mandatory 
compliance of the accessibility rules by new establishments and provides 

PART E 
Page 43 of 51 
 
significant consequences for non-compliance with the rules. At the stage prior 
to construction, it is stipulated that no establishment will be granted permission 
to build the structure if the building plan does not adhere to the accessibility 
rules. At the stage after construction, it is stipulated that no establishment shall 
be issued a certificate of completion or take occupation of a building if it fails to 
comply with the accessibility rules. Therefore, Section 44 deals with the second 
prong of the right to accessibility identified above – planning for the future and 
ensuring that new infrastructure is accessible from its inception. Sections 45 
and 46 deal with the first prong, i.e. to retrofit existing inaccessible infrastructure 
to ensure accessibility. They provide a timeline for compliance with the 
accessibility rules. Section 45 lays down a timeline of five years from the date 
of the notification of the RPWD Rules for making existing public buildings 
accessible in accordance with the accessibility rules. Similarly, Section 46 
provides a timeline of two years for service providers to comply with the 
accessibility rules. As noted above, the RPWD rules came into force on 15 June 
2017 and thus, the timelines in these provisions have long passed.  
67.  The marginal note to Rule 15(1) states that it contains “Rules for 
Accessibility”. Further, Rule 15(1) uses “shall” in its chapeau indicating that 
the standards that follow in clauses (a) to (p) are mandatory. Till this 
understanding of the framework, the counsel for the petitioner, the Union of 
India and the NALSAR-CDS are all in agreement. The next step, therefore, is 
to look at the content of the various standards prescribed in Rule 15(1).  
 
68. A perusal of the “standards” for accessibility laid down in clauses (a) to (p) of 
Rule 15(1), in the form of the guidelines issued by the concerned ministries, 

PART E 
Page 44 of 51 
 
indicates that most of these documents do not contain mandatory or non-
negotiable prescriptions. The use of the term ‘guidelines’ rather than ‘rules’ in 
most of these documents is not a mere difference in nomenclature, but is 
evident in the content of these documents as well.75 To better appreciate this, 
we may refer to one of these standards, namely, HG 2021 which is prescribed 
under Rule 15(1)(a). The stated objectives of this document are as follows:  
 
 
“1.2 Objectives 
[…] following are the key objectives of these 
guidelines: 
1. Sensitize diverse stakeholders regarding the 
various accessibility needs and provisions for 
diverse population groups in the built environment. 
2. 
Introduce 
and 
orient 
universal 
design 
perspectives to all stakeholders for creating 
inclusive built environments for all.  
3. Recommend specific built environment elements 
along 
with 
their 
accessibility 
attributes 
and 
specifications.  
4. Develop a holistic approach to accessibility 
through integration of appropriate technologies.  
5. 
Guide 
accessibility 
assessment 
and 
implementation in built environments.” 
 
(Emphasis Supplied)  
 
69. The objectives extracted above indicate that the idea of the document is not to 
lay down rules, which are non-negotiable and have tangible consequences in 
case of non-compliance, but rather to merely “sensitize”, “recommend” and 
“guide”. Over 400 pages long, the HG 2021 contains guidelines which are 
couched in the language of a policy document. It uses discretionary terms, such 
as “recommend”, “may”, “it is desirable for…” and so on while laying down the 
 
75 Gulf Goans Hotels Co. Ltd. v. Union of India, (2014) 10 SCC 673 [15-16].  

PART E 
Page 45 of 51 
 
standards of accessibility. It is impractical, as to how guidelines framed in such 
terms, can be understood as “non-negotiable”, failing which certain 
consequences follow under the RPWD Act, including no permission to build, 
holding back of completion certificates or penal fines. 
 
70.  Similar objectives are found in the guidelines prescribed in other clauses of 
Rule 15 as well. Illustratively, at random, we may refer to the (i) Guidelines for 
Accessibility Standards in the Port Sector issued by the Ministry of Port 
Shipping and Waterways; and (ii) Accessibility Standards and Guidelines for 
Civil Aviation 2022. The stated objectives of these documents are as follows: 
 
“Accessibility Standards in the Port Sector 
 
“The guidelines provided here are illustrative in 
nature and not exhaustive. They intend to meet the 
immediate requirements of Accessibility to ensure 
that the facilities are made usable by the persons 
with disability and reduced mobility. Besides these 
guidelines, the sector specific detailed guidelines 
made by Experts such as the guidelines on 
Accessibility Standards prepared by Tourism and 
Travel Department, Transport Department, Hotel 
Industry, Commercial and Industrial Department 
may also be, to the extent relevant, relied upon and 
used at different places in the Port, Harbours and 
Piers. To this extent, these guidelines are not 
conclusive; but are open to continual improvement.” 
 
These guidelines can be used as broad guiding 
principles for planning of Accessibility Standards at 
the time of construction of Cruise and Passenger 
Terminals, Transport Hubs in the Ports and 
harbours as also in retrofitting the existing 
structures. To ensure that these guidelines remain 
practical for implementation, salient features of the 
guidelines have been discussed with the Nodal 
Officer 
for 
Cruise 
Tourism 
and 
the 
other 
Stakeholders.”

Accessibility Standards and Guidelines for Civil 
Aviation 
 
This document is a foundation stone in achieving 
accessible airports. It’s true success shall be seen 
in the implementation at various airports resulting in 
more safe, inclusive and convenient customer 
experience and we believe that it will happen over 
time.” 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
 
71. The above extracts indicate that these two documents also do not envisage 
mandatory rules and instead appear to be recommendatory guidelines. The 
Accessibility Standards in the Port Sector are conceived as “illustrative”, and 
“non-conclusive” and only as “broad guidelines” for both new construction and 
retrofitting. It is difficult to fathom how a document which is only illustrative and 
contains broad guidelines, can be mandatorily enforced, with consequences 
such as fines and withholding of completion certificates. Similarly, the 
Accessibility Standards and Guidelines for Civil Aviation also indicate that they 
seek to be achieved “over time”. As noted above, Section 44, which deals with 
new buildings, requires immediate compliance and Sections 45 and 46, which 
deal with existing infrastructure prescribe fixed timelines. Guidelines which are 
aspirational and require compliance “over time” run contrary to this legislative 
intent. Some other guidelines and documents prescribed in Rule 15(1), do state 
that they are “mandatory codes”, however, this segregation between mandatory 
and discretionary guidelines has not been carried out.  
 
72. Further, not only do several of these documents themselves state that they are 
guidelines or aspirational principles, but the NALSAR-CDS report indicates that 
even if this nomenclature is ignored, they cannot be practically enforced as 

PART E 
Page 47 of 51 
 
mandatory rules. This is because inter alia several of these guidelines contain 
different standards for the same or similar accessibility requirements and 
allegedly contain technical errors. For instance, with regard to “accessible 
toilets”, almost all the guidelines contain different requirements – both in terms 
of requirements and measurements. For instance, there is a difference in the 
requirements stipulated in HG 2021 and Accessibility Standards and Guidelines 
for Civil Aviation with regard to accessible toilets.76 It is difficult to fathom, 
therefore, which of the two requirements is “mandatory” to follow.  
 
73. It is trite law that the legislature cannot abdicate essential legislative functions 
to the delegated authority. The legislature can entrust subsidiary or ancillary 
legislation to the delegate. However, before such delegation, the legislature 
should enunciate the policy and the principles for the guidance of the delegated 
authority. As a corollary, the delegated authority must carry out its rule-making 
functions within the framework of the law. The delegated legislation must be 
consistent with the law under which it is made and cannot go beyond the limits 
of policy and standards laid down in the law.77  
 
74. Rule 15, in its current form, does not provide for non-negotiable compulsory 
standards, but only persuasive guidelines. While the intention of the RPWD Act 
to use compulsion is clear, the RPWD Rules have transformed into self-
regulation by way of delegated legislation. The absence of compulsion in the 
Rules is contrary to the intent of the RPWD Act. While Rule 15 creates an 
 
76 See Table 4.1, HG 2021.  
77 Gaurav Kumar v. Union of India & Ors., 2024 INSC 558 [27-29].  

PART F

aspirational ceiling, through the guidelines prescribed by it, it is unable to 
perform the function entrusted to it by the RPWD Act, i.e., to create a non-
negotiable floor. A ceiling without a floor is hardly a sturdy structure. While it is 
true that accessibility is a right that requires “progressive realization”, this 
cannot mean that there is no base level of non-negotiable rules that must be 
adhered to. While the formulation of detailed guidelines by the various ministries 
is undoubtedly a laudable step, this must be done in addition to prescribing 
mandatory rules, and not in place of it. Therefore, Rule 15(1) contravenes the 
provisions and legislative intent of the RPWD Act and is thus ultra vires, the Act.  
 
F. Conclusion  
 
75. In view of the above, we hold that several of the guidelines prescribed in Rule 
15, appear to be recommendatory guidelines, under the garb of mandatory 
rules. Rule 15(1) is thus ultra vires the scheme and legislative intent of the 
RPWD Act which creates a mechanism for mandatory compliance. Creating a 
minimum floor of accessibility cannot be left to the altar of “progressive 
realization”.  
 
76. The Union Government is, accordingly, directed to delineate mandatory rules, 
as required by Section 40, within a period of three months from the date of this 
Judgment. This exercise may involve segregating the non-negotiable rules from 
the expansive guidelines already prescribed in Rule 15. The Union Government 
must conduct this exercise in consultation with all stakeholders, and NALSAR-
CDS is directed to be involved in the process. It is clarified that progressive 
compliance with the standards listed in the existing Rule 15(1) and the progress 

PART F 
Page 49 of 51 
 
towards the targets of the Accessible India Campaign must continue unabated. 
However, in addition, a baseline of non-negotiable rules must be prescribed in 
Rule 15.  
 
77. Once these mandatory rules are prescribed, the Union of India, States and 
Union Territories are directed to ensure that the consequences prescribed in 
Sections 44, 45, 46 and 89 of the RPWD Act, including the holding back of 
completion certificates and imposition of fines are implemented in cases of non-
compliance with Rule 15. 
 
78. The following principles of accessibility should be considered while carrying out 
the above exercise: 
 
a.  
Universal Design: The rules should prioritize universal design principles, 
making spaces and services usable by all individuals to the greatest extent 
possible, without requiring adaptations or specialized design; 
b.  
Comprehensive Inclusion Across Disabilities: Rules should cover a 
wide range of disabilities including physical, sensory, intellectual, and 
psychosocial disabilities. This includes provisions for specific conditions 
such as autism, cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, psychosocial 
disabilities, sickle cell disease, and ichthyosis; 
c.  
Assistive Technology Integration: Mandating the integration of assistive 
and adaptive technologies, such as screen readers, audio descriptions, and 
accessible digital interfaces, to ensure digital and informational accessibility 
across public and private platforms; and 

PART F 
Page 50 of 51 
 
d.  
Ongoing Stakeholder Consultation: This process should involve 
continuous consultation with persons with disabilities and advocacy 
organizations to incorporate lived experiences and practical insights. 
 
79.  The Petitioner and NALSAR CDS have proposed a series of recommendations 
with regard to the existing legal framework. The Union Government is directed 
to meaningfully consider these recommendations while reworking the content 
of Rule 15.  
 
80. NALSAR-CDS states that the report has been prepared using their own 
resources, and no financial claims have been made to the Ministry of Social 
Justice and Empowerment. Annexure II of the NALSAR-CDS Report indicates 
that it has been prepared over a period of six months, after consulting fifty-two 
experts, receiving reports from fourteen states and three Union Territories, and 
with over hundred reports from organizations and individual testimonies. As the 
report states, it is “a present-day example of creating a knowledge commons.” 
This Court records its appreciation for and is cognizant of the labour of time, 
effort, and resources expended by the NALSAR-CDS in preparing this report. 
Accordingly, the Union of India in the Ministry of Social Justice and 
Empowerment is directed to pay NALSAR-CDS an amount of INR 50,00,000 
as compensation for the work, which was carried out in a timely and 
comprehensive manner. The amount shall be disbursed to NALSAR-CDS no 
later than 15 December 2024.

which date, the Union Government must report compliance to this Court.
