3.1 The respondent instituted a suit before the 
Munsiff Court, Tiruchengode registered as OS 
No.200/2011 claiming relief of declaration that 
the sale deed dated 10.02.2011 executed by the 
first defendant in favour of second defendant was 
null and void and to declare that suit property 
belonged to the plaintiffs and further for relief of 
an injunction against the defendants.  
3.2 According to the plaint case, the property in 
question originally belonged to one Avinashi 
Gounder 
who 
had 
four 
sons 
namely, 
Arunachalam, 
Arumugam, 
Ramasamy 
and 
Palaniyappan.  Plaintiff No.1 is the wife and 
plaintiff no.2 is the adopted son of Arunachalam. 
The 
first 
defendant 
is 
the 
daughter 
of 
Palaniyappan and the second defendant is the 
vendee of the suit property from defendant no.1. 
3.3 According to the plaintiffs, the four brothers had 
entered into an oral partition and the suit 
property came to the share of Arunachalam. 
Subsequently Arunachalam on 16.07.2003, had 
executed a will whereby the suit property and 
other properties belonging to Arunachalam were 
bequeathed in favour of the plaintiffs. Upon the 

SLP (C) Appeal No. 15541 of 2023 
 
Page 3 of 10 
 
death of Arunachalam on 30.04.2006, the 
plaintiffs became the absolute owners of the 
property in suit.  Further case of the plaintiffs 
was that plaintiff no.2 and defendant no.2 were 
running a partnership business and the property 
in suit was offered as a security to the Karur 
Vysya Bank. It was the second defendant who 
had signed the loan papers and the security 
papers with the Bank.  As the loan amount could 
not be repaid by defendant no.2, it was plaintiff 
no.2 who had cleared the outstanding loan of the 
Bank.  Further it is claimed that defendant no.2 
clandestinely 
obtained 
the 
sale 
deed 
on 
10.02.2011 in respect of the suit property from 
the first defendant. It was further the case of the 
plaintiff that the entire property which was 
allotted to Palaniyappan (father of defendant 
no.1) had been sold by defendant no.1 on 
15.07.1981 with specific boundaries to one 
Mathiyalagan.  It was thus the claim of the 
plaintiffs that the defendants would not have any 
right over the properties of Avinashi Gounder and 
that the plaintiffs were in possession and were 
cultivating the land in suit but as the defendant

Page 4 of 10 
 
no.2 tried to trespass the suit property on 
24.07.2011, the necessity for filing the suit arose.  
3.4 The defendants filed their written statement 
denying that there was any oral partition 
between the sons of Avinashi Gounder with 
respect to the suit property.  They also denied 
that plaintiff no.2 was the adopted son of 
Arunachalam.  The defendants had further 
pleaded that survey number in question had a 
total 
area 
of 
2.17 
cents 
in 
which 
Avanashigounder’s family had 1/3rd share i.e. 72 
cents.  These 72 cents were partitioned amongst 
the three sons of Avanashigounder namely, 
Arunachalam, Ramasamy and Palaniyappan.  
The fourth son Arumugam had died issueless 
and his share was equally shared by the three 
brothers. Thus, each brother became entitled to 
24 cents.  Palaniyappan, father of defendant no.1 
had 24 cents in this property, out of which 12 
cents fell to the share of defendant no.1, out of 
which, she sold 11 cents to the second 
defendant.  Plaintiffs had set up a case without 
any basis only in order to deprive the defendants 
of their property. It was also pleaded that there

were other co-owners in survey number in 
question who had not been impleaded as 
defendants, as such the suit was bad in law for 
non-joinder of necessary parties.   
4. The Trial Court framed the following six issues 
on the basis of the pleadings of the parties:  
(i). Whether the plaintiff is entitled for decree of 
declaration as prayed for? 
(ii). Whether the plaintiff is entitled for decree of 
permanent injunction as prayed for? 
(iii). Whether the husband of the 1st plaintiff 
executed a will on 16.07.2003? 
(iv). Whether the 2nd plaintiff is the legal heir of the 
deceased Arunachalam? 
(v). 
Whether the suit is bad for non-joinder of 
necessary parties?  
(vi). To what other relief? 
 
5. The parties led oral and documentary evidence.  
Both the plaintiffs examined themselves as PW 1 
and PW 2 and one Mathiyalagan was examined 
as PW 3 and they proved six papers Exh.A1 to 
A6. On behalf of the defendants one Balarajendra 
was examined as DW1 and he proved six papers 

SLP (C) Appeal No. 15541 of 2023 
 
Page 6 of 10 
 
Exh.B1 to B6.  Both the defendants did not enter 
the witness box.   
6. The 
Trial 
Court 
discussed 
the 
evidence 
threadbare and recorded the following findings: 
(i). Both 
the 
plaintiffs 
had 
pleaded 
that 
Arunachalam had executed a will on 16.07.2003 
but they failed to prove the said will deed in 
accordance to the statutory provisions contained 
in Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 
and also under Section 63 of the Indian 
Succession Act, 1956.  Thus, their claim on the 
basis of the will was not found to be 
substantiated; 
(ii). The suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary 
parties as the co-owners/co-sharers were not 
impleaded as defendants; 
(iii). The plaintiffs were not the owners of the property 
in suit, they had not been able to prove the oral 
partition and as such were found to be not 
entitled to any relief. 
7. Accordingly, it dismissed the suit, vide judgment 
dated 08.09.2015.  
8. The plaintiffs preferred an appeal which was 
registered as Appeal Suit No.55/2016.  The 

SLP (C) Appeal No. 15541 of 2023 
 
Page 7 of 10 
 
Subordinate 
Court, 
Tiruchengodu, 
vide 
judgment dated 27.11.2020, after considering 
the evidence on record, approved the findings 
recorded by the Trial Court and, accordingly, 
dismissed the appeal. Once again specific 
findings were recorded that the oral partition had 
not been proved by the plaintiffs.  For the said 
purpose, both the Courts below had relied upon 
the evidence led by the parties, both oral and 
documentary.   
9. The First Appellate Court also approved the 
finding regarding non-joinder of necessary 
parties.   
10. Aggrieved by the same, the plaintiffs preferred 
Second Appeal before the High Court, registered 
as Second Appeal No.351/2021.  The High Court 
proceeded on the premise that the only dispute 
was with respect to the oral partition, as to 
whether oral partition had taken place or not and 
if yes, whether it was duly proved? The High 
Court relied upon Ex.A-3, A-4 and Ex.B-3 to hold 
that there had been an oral partition.  Ex.A-3 is 
the Mortgage Deed dated 13.10.2009.  Ex.A-4 is 
the Sale Deed dated 15.07.1981. Ex.B-3 is the 

SLP (C) Appeal No. 15541 of 2023 
 
Page 8 of 10 
 
Sale Deed dated 02.05.2008.  All these three 
documents were relied upon only for the reason 
that they mentioned boundaries.  Based only on 
the finding that oral partition was proved, the 
High Court allowed the second appeal and after 
setting aside the judgments of the Courts below 
decreed the suit.  
11. Heard counsel for the appellants.  Despite service 
of notice, no one appeared on behalf of the 
respondents.  
12. The two sale deeds relate to different properties 
and not to survey number in question.  Whether 
any partition with respect to the survey number 
in question had taken place or not, is not borne 
out from the record. The suit property was never 
recorded in the name of the plaintiffs or for that 
matter, husband of plaintiff no.1, at any time.  
The will which was the basis of the claim of the 
plaintiff, had not been found to be proved in 
accordance to law. The Trial Court and the First 
Appellate Court had dealt with the documents 
Exh.A-4 and B-3, the two sale deeds, and found 
that these were not sufficient to prove the oral 
partition or in any manner establish the oral 

SLP (C) Appeal No. 15541 of 2023 
 
Page 9 of 10 
 
partition with respect to the survey number in 
question. 
13. Interestingly although the plaintiffs set up a case 
that the land in suit was coming from Avinashi 
Gounder but on record, two pattas were filed 
which establish that the survey number in 
question had been allotted in the name of 
plaintiff no.1 and eight others jointly with respect 
to which there was no partition. This fact had 
been 
admitted 
by 
the 
plaintiffs 
in 
their 
deposition.  All these aspects had been 
considered by the Trial Court and the First 
Appellate Court but the High Court failed to 
consider the oral as also the documentary 
evidence. Only on the basis of the two sale deeds 
and one mortgage deed, which relate to different 
piece and parcels of land, the High Court 
recorded a perverse finding that oral partition 
had taken place.  It also did not deal with the 
other findings recorded by the Courts below. 
14. In view of the above discussion and on the 
findings recorded above, the impugned judgment 
cannot be sustained as it not only does not 
conform to the scope of Section 100 of the Code 

SLP (C) Appeal No. 15541 of 2023 
 
Page 10 of 10 
 
of Civil Procedure, 1908 but also as it was 
perverse on appreciated evidence, and also 
ignoring material evidence.   
15. The 
appeal 
is, 
accordingly, 
allowed. 
The 
impugned judgment and order of the High Court 
is set aside and that of the Trial Court and the 
First Appellate Court is confirmed. The suit of the 
respondent-plaintiff stands dismissed.  
16. There shall be no order as to costs.
