1. 
The main question involved in these appeals is about the 
effect of delay in executing the death sentence.  
FACTUAL ASPECTS 
2. 
The deceased was employed in a company as an 
Associate.  The deceased was required to attend the night shift 
between 11:00 pm and 09:00 am.  On 1st November 2007, one 
Purushottam Dasrath Borate (Convict no.2) was scheduled to 
pick up the deceased from her residence at 10:30 pm.  Convict 
no.2 was the driver of the cab hired by the employer of the 
deceased.  As per usual practice, Convict no.2 gave a missed

call to the deceased.  After receiving the missed call, the 
deceased came down.  After picking up the deceased, Convict 
no.2 was supposed to pick up one Sagar Bidkar, an employee 
of the same company.  Though Sagar repeatedly called Convict 
no.2, there was no response.  At about 12:45 am, Convict no.2 
came to pick up Sagar.  When Sagar sat in the vehicle, one 
Pradeep Yashwant Kokade (Convict no.1/Respondent no.1) 
was already occupying the car's rear seat.  Convict no.1 
introduced convict no.2 to Sagar as his friend.  Before the 
vehicle reached the company's office, Convict no.1 alighted 
from the car.  Convict no.2 requested Sagar to endorse in the 
company's record that the delay was due to the puncture of a 
tyre in the vehicle. 
3. 
On the morning of 2nd November 2007, when the 
deceased did not return home, her sister enquired with the 
office of the deceased. She was told that the deceased had not 
reported for duty.  The deceased's sister lodged a missing 
person report with the local Police Station.  The body of the 
deceased was found on the morning of 2nd November 2007.  In 
the postmortem report, the cause of death was stated as shock 
and haemorrhage due to grievous injuries to the vital organs.  
There was a fracture of the skull involving the frontal, left 
temporal, and parietal bones with a laceration to the brain.  Rib 
nos.2, 3 and 4 were fractured and the right lung was ruptured.  
The postmortem report recorded that the deceased was raped 
before her death.  On 3rd November 2007, both the convicts 
were taken into judicial custody.  By the judgment dated 20th 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 3 of 58 
 
March 2012, the learned Sessions Judge, Pune, convicted both 
the convicts for the offences punishable under Sections 302, 
376(2)(g), 364, and 404, read with Section 120-B of the Indian 
Penal Code, 1860 (for short, ‘the IPC’).  Both the convicts were 
sentenced to death. The proceedings were sent to the High 
Court of Judicature at Bombay in accordance with Section 366 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, ‘the CrPC’) 
for confirmation of the death penalty.  By the judgment dated 
25th September 2012, the High Court held that the case of the 
convicts was falling in the category of ‘rarest of the rare case’.  
Therefore, the High Court proceeded to confirm the death 
sentence.  This Court also confirmed the death sentence by the 
judgment dated 8th May 2015.  
4. 
On 29th May 2015, the Superintendent of Yerawada 
Central Prison, Pune (for short, ‘the Superintendent of Prison’) 
informed the Registrar of this Court that the contents of the 
judgment dated 8th May 2015 of this Court had been explained 
to the convicts in the language known to them. On 1st June 
2015, the convicts gave a statement to the jail officers that they 
were desirous of filing a review petition before this Court.  The 
decision was informed to the Home Department, Government 
of Maharashtra on 2nd June 2015, by a letter issued by the 
Superintendent of Prison.   On 10th July 2015, the convicts filed 
mercy petitions addressed to the Hon’ble Governor of the State 
of Maharashtra.  On 16th July 2015, the Superintendent of 
Prison forwarded the mercy petitions to the Principal 
Secretary of 
the Home 
Department, 
Government 
of 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 4 of 58 
 
Maharashtra. On 17th August 2015, the Home Department, 
Government of Maharashtra, addressed a letter to the 
Superintendent of Prison to verify whether the convicts had 
filed any review petition before this Court.  On 22nd August 
2015, the convicts confirmed to the Superintendent of Prison 
that they had not filed any review petition.  The Superintendent 
of Prison communicated this fact to the Home Department, 
State of Maharashtra, vide a letter dated 24th August 2015.  
Even the Office of the Additional Director General of Police and 
Inspector General of Prisons (for short, ‘the ADG (Prisons)’) 
addressed a similar communication on 26th August 2015, 
confirming that the convicts had filed no review petition. 
5. 
Five months after receiving the mercy petitions, on 25th 
January 2016, a note was prepared by the Section Officer of 
the Home Department, State Government for the benefit of the 
Hon’ble Governor. Pursuant to the letter dated 17th July 2015 
sent by the ADG (Prisons), the Superintendent of Prison by his 
letter dated 27th January 2016, forwarded necessary factual 
details to the Principal Secretary of the Home Department 
along with a copy of the judgment of conviction of the Sessions 
Court.  On 1st February 2016, the Superintendent of Prison 
requested the Senior Inspector of Police of the concerned Police 
Station to supply English translations of the police diary, a 
short crime history in English, copies of FIR, dying declaration 
and a copy of the charge and reason for commitment.  On 29th 
March 2016, the Hon’ble Governor rejected the mercy petitions.  
A communication to that effect was issued by the Deputy 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023

Secretary to the Hon’ble Governor to the Additional Chief 
Secretary 
of 
the 
Home 
Department, 
Government 
of 
Maharashtra by a letter dated 29th March 2016.  On 9th April 
2016, the Superintendent of Prison received a letter dated 6th 
April 2016 from the Home Department, Government of 
Maharashtra, informing about the rejection of the mercy 
petitions.  According to the case of the appellant state of 
Maharashtra, the Hon'ble Governor's rejection of the mercy 
petitions was communicated to the convicts on the same day. 
6. 
Convict no.1 intimated his desire to file a mercy petition 
before the Hon’ble President of India.  This desire was recorded 
in the statement of Convict no.1 dated 11th April 2016 by the 
prison officials.  After that, there was correspondence 
exchanged by the ADG (Prisons), the Superintendent of Prison, 
the concerned Police Station, the State Government, etc., 
between 13th April 2016 and 31st May 2016. 
7. 
On 11th June 2016, relatives of the convicts submitted 
fresh mercy petitions before the Hon’ble President of India.  On 
15th June 2016 and 22nd July 2016, the Under Secretary 
(Judicial), Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India (for 
short, ‘Under Secretary (GOI)’) issued letters of request to the 
Principal Secretary, Home Department, Government of 
Maharashtra for the supply of documents.  On 9th August 
2016, the Under Secretary, Home Department, Government of 
Maharashtra addressed a letter to the ADG (Prisons) and the 
Superintendent of Prison to supply information regarding the 
past criminal history of the convicts, the economic condition of 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 6 of 58 
 
the families of convicts and the filing of any review petitions by 
the convicts.  On 5th September 2016, the Superintendent of 
Prison addressed a letter to the concerned Police Station 
requesting information regarding the past criminal history and 
economic condition of the family of convicts.  The Under 
Secretary (GOI) addressed a reminder on 6th September 2016 
to the Home Department, Government of Maharashtra, 
requesting to supply the documents.  On 9th September 2016, 
the Superintendent of Prison confirmed by addressing a letter 
to the Home Department, Government of Maharashtra, that the 
convicts had not filed review petitions.  On 12th September 
2016, the concerned Police Station forwarded to the Home 
Department, 
Government 
of 
Maharashtra, 
the 
details 
regarding the criminal history and economic condition of the 
convicts.  On 30th September 2016, the Home Department of 
the State Government addressed a letter to the Under Secretary 
(GOI) 
giving 
information 
about 
the 
criminal 
history and economic condition of the convicts and filing of 
review petitions by the convict.  On 26th December 2016, the 
Under Secretary (GOI) addressed a letter to the Home 
Department, Government of Maharashtra, for confirmation 
regarding the decision of the convicts not to file review 
petitions.  This information was sought by the Home 
Department, Government of Maharashtra, by the letter dated 
16th January 2017 from the ADG (Prisons) and the 
Superintendent of Prison.  Accordingly, on 21st January 2017, 
statements of the convicts were recorded in which they stated 
that though they intended to file review petitions, the same 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 7 of 58 
 
have not been filed.  This information was furnished by the 
Offices of Superintendent of Prison and the ADG (Prisons) to 
the Home Department of the State Government in separate 
letters dated 23rd January 2017 and 7th February 2017, 
respectively.  On 22nd February 2017, the Home Department, 
Government of Maharashtra, informed the Under Secretary 
(Judicial), Home Department, Government of India, confirming 
that the convicts intended to file review petitions.  The said 
letter recorded that both the convicts had decided to file review 
petitions after the decision of the Hon’ble President of India on 
the mercy petitions.  The Hon’ble President on 26th May 2017 
rejected the mercy petitions.  This information was submitted 
by the Under Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government 
of India, to the Principal Secretary, Home Department, 
Government of Maharashtra, in a letter dated 6th June 2017.  
By separate letters dated 19th June 2017 addressed to the 
family members of the convicts and the learned Sessions 
Judge, Pune, the Superintendent of Prison informed them 
about the rejection of the mercy petitions. 
8. 
On 10th August 2017, the Superintendent of Prison 
addressed a letter to the learned Sessions Judge, Pune, 
requesting him to issue a warrant for the execution of 
the death sentence.  On 24th August 2017, the Superintendent 
of Prison addressed a letter to the Registrar of this Court 
requesting him to provide information about any review 
petition filed by the convicts.  By a letter dated 9th September 
2017, the Registrar of this Court communicated to the 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 8 of 58 
 
Superintendent of Prison that no review petitions were filed by 
the convicts.  On 5th October 2017, 18th July 2018 and 29th 
August 2018, letters were addressed by the Superintendent of 
Prison to the learned Sessions Judge, Pune, requesting him to 
issue a warrant of execution of the death sentence.  On 17th 
October 2018, a letter was sent by the ADG (Prisons) to the 
learned Sessions Judge, Pune, requesting him to fix a date for 
the execution of the death sentence.   As no action was taken 
by the Sessions Court, Pune, the Home Department of the 
Government of Maharashtra on 30th October 2018, addressed 
a letter to the Law and Judiciary Department of the State 
Government making a query whether the Home Department 
could proceed with the execution of death sentence in 
accordance with the provisions of the Maharashtra Prison 
Manual.  By the letter dated 12th November 2018, the Law and 
Judiciary Department of the State Government informed the 
Home Department of the State Government that the exclusive 
jurisdiction to issue warrants for executing the death sentence 
was of the learned Sessions Court.  Meanwhile, on 2nd 
November 2018, the learned Sessions Judge, Pune, addressed 
a letter to the Home Department, Government of Maharashtra, 
seeking information about the status of mercy petitions.  On 
7th December 2018 and 27th December 2018, the ADG (Prisons) 
and the Superintendent of Prison addressed letters to the 
learned Sessions Court, Pune, requesting him to fix a date for 
executing the death sentence.  On 31st January 2019, the 
Home Department of the State Government wrote a letter to the 
ADG (Prisons) and the Superintendent of Prison informing 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 9 of 58 
 
them about the letter dated 2nd November 2018 sent by the 
learned Sessions Court, Pune.  On 10th April 2019, warrants 
for the execution of the death sentence were issued by the 
Sessions Court, Pune. 
GROUNDS OF CHALLENGE BEFORE THE HIGH COURT 
9. 
On 2nd May 2019, the convicts filed separate writ 
petitions before the High Court.  A prayer was made in the 
petitions for quashing the warrants of execution of the death 
sentence, inter alia, on the following grounds: 
i. Inordinate and unexplained sdelay in execution of death 
sentence on the part of the State Government as well as 
the Sessions Court, Pune; 
ii. Inordinate and unexplained delay in deciding mercy 
petitions; 
iii. The convicts were kept in solitary confinement during the 
pendency of the appeals before this Court as well as the 
mercy petitions before the Hon’ble Governor of the State 
of Maharashtra and the Hon’ble President of India; 
iv. Rejection of mercy petitions was illegal on account of non-
application of mind due to non-placement of relevant 
information before the concerned authorities; and, 
v. The Sessions Court, Pune, issued death warrants without 
notice to the convicts or their family members. 
10. 
Counter affidavits were filed in the writ petitions before 
the High Court by various officers.  By the impugned judgment 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 10 of 58 
 
dated 29th July 2019, the High Court held that there was an 
undue and avoidable delay in executing the death sentence.  
Moreover, the convicts were kept in solitary confinement from 
20th March 2012.  Therefore, the High Court proceeded to 
commute the death sentence to life imprisonment for a total 
period of thirty-five years.  The warrants for the execution of 
the death sentence issued by the learned Sessions Court, Pune, 
were set aside. 
SUBMISSIONS  
11. 
Mr Shreeyash Lalit, the learned counsel representing the 
appellants, made detailed submissions.  He referred to a 
decision of this Court in the case of T.V.Vatheesswaran v. 
State of Tamil Nadu1.  He also pointed out a decision of the 
three Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Sher Singh & 
Ors. v. State of Punjab2.  He pointed out that in the case of 
T.V. Vatheesswaran1, it was held that a delay beyond two 
years in the execution of the death sentence was enough to 
commute the death sentence to life imprisonment.  However, 
in the case of Sher Singh & Ors2, it was held that a delay of 
two years is not enough for the commutation of a death 
sentence.  Ultimately, this conflict was resolved by a decision 
by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of 
Triveniben v. State of Gujarat3.  He also pointed out various 
decisions of this Court in the cases of Shatrughan Chauhan 
 
1  (1983) 2 SCC 68 
2  (1983) 2 SCC 344 
3  (1989) 1 SCC 678 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023

& Anr. v. Union of India & Ors.4, Ajay Kumar Pal v. Union 
of India & Anr5, Mukesh v. Union of India & Ors.6 and B.A. 
Umesh v. Union of India & Ors7.  He submitted that though 
undue delay in the execution of a death sentence will entitle 
convicts to seek commutation, no fixed period of delay can be 
laid down as a criterion for commutation.  He submitted that 
in such a case, the twin test must be satisfied.  The first test is 
whether there was an avoidable delay.  The second test is 
whether the quantum of delay was unduly long or inordinate, 
which must warrant the commutation of a death sentence to 
life imprisonment.  The learned counsel urged that both the 
tests must be satisfied to make out a case for commutation of 
a death sentence.  He submitted that neither of these two tests 
alone would be sufficient to commute the death sentence. 
12. 
The learned counsel submitted that the High Court has 
committed an error by holding that the quantum of delay is not 
material.  He submitted that the delay has to be inordinate and, 
therefore, the quantum of delay is very material.  He submitted 
that the time consumed for the disposal of mercy petitions by 
the Hon’ble Governor and the Hon’ble President of India was 
from 10th July 2015 to 26th May 2017, which is about one year 
and ten months.  His submission is that this delay cannot be 
held to be inordinate or unexplained.  He submitted that, in 
any case, there is an explanation for the delay.  He submitted 
 
4  (2014) 3 SCC 1 
5  (2015) 2 SCC 478 
6  (2020) 16 SCC 424 
7  2022 SCC OnLine SC 1528 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 12 of 58 
 
that there was some delay as time was required to ascertain 
whether the convicts wanted to file review petitions.  He 
submitted that the time taken of a few months to prepare a 
note for presenting it to the Hon’ble Governor could not be said 
to be unreasonable as it required scanning of voluminous 
records.  Even the time of three months taken by the Hon’ble 
Governor cannot be said to be unreasonable. 
13. 
As regards the delay in the disposal of mercy petitions by 
the Hon’ble President of India, he submitted that the time of 
five months was consumed in getting information on the 
criminal antecedents and economic condition of the convicts.  
Time of about four months or more was required to get the 
information on the issue of convicts filing review petitions 
before this Court.  The Hon’ble President of India took about 
four months to decide on the mercy petitions, which is not at 
all long or inordinate considering the fact that the issue was 
the life and death of the convicts.  He submitted that in the 
case of B.A. Umesh7, the delay of two years and three months 
in the disposal of the mercy petition was held as not excessive. 
14. 
The learned counsel submitted that the major delay is on 
the part of the Sessions Court in issuing the warrants of 
execution of the death sentence.  He submitted that on 19th 
June 2017, the Superintendent of Prison had communicated 
to the Sessions Court about the Hon’ble President of India's 
rejection of the mercy petitions.  There was an exchange of 
correspondence by the Government Officers with the Sessions 
Court, and only on 10th April 2019 were warrants issued for 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 13 of 58 
 
the execution of the death sentence issued by the Sessions 
Court.  He submitted that in view of the decision of the 
Constitution Bench in the case of Triveniben3, only the delay 
caused by the executive could be taken into consideration to 
decide whether there was any violation of Article 21 of the 
Constitution of India. 
15. 
As regards the finding of the High Court on keeping the 
convicts in solitary confinement before rejection of mercy 
petitions, the learned counsel pointed out that in the affidavit 
of the Superintendent of Prison, it was pointed out that the 
convicts were kept in a security yard wherein they were allowed 
to access the veranda and interact with other prisoners from 
06:00 am to 06:30 pm.  He pointed out that there was a fan 
and light bulb in their cell. In their room, there was usually 
more than one inmate.  Moreover, they had access to an open 
ground.  He, therefore, submitted that in view of the law laid 
down by this Court in the case of Vinay Sharma v. Union of 
India & Ors8, it cannot be said that the convicts were kept in 
solitary confinement. 
16. 
The learned counsel submitted that in the execution 
warrants, more than a reasonable period was provided from the 
date of warrants till the date of execution.  Copies of the 
warrants were immediately supplied to the convicts.  He 
submitted that merely because the convicts were not brought 
before the Sessions Court while proceeding with issuance of 
 
8  (2020) 4 SCC 391 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 14 of 58 
 
warrants, this lapse by itself, was not sufficient to commute the 
sentence to life imprisonment.  The learned counsel also made 
suggestions for issuing guidelines for effective compliance with 
Sections 413 and 414 of the CrPC corresponding to Sections 
453 and 454 of the Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 
(for short, ‘the BNSS’).  In short, the submission of the learned 
counsel appearing for the appellants is that there was no 
warrant for commuting the death sentence. 
17. 
Ms. Payoshi Roy, the learned counsel representing the 
respondents-convicts submitted that as held by this Court in 
the case of Sher Singh & Ors2, Article 21 of the Constitution 
of India inheres in every person till his last breath.  The learned 
counsel submitted that unreasonable delay in adjudicating 
upon the mercy petitions makes the punishment barbaric and, 
hence, unconstitutional.  She submitted that, in fact, avoidable 
delay in deciding the mercy petitions violates constitutional 
due process, which includes fair, just and reasonable 
procedure.  The learned counsel relied upon the observations 
made by this Court in the cases of Sher Singh & Ors2 and 
Ajay Kumar Pal5.  The learned counsel submitted that the 
executive authorities should follow a self-imposed rule that 
every mercy petition must be disposed of within three months.  
The delay beyond a period of three months must be, prima 
facie, presumed to be excessive, which puts the burden on the 
State Government to explain the delay.  She submitted that no 
fixed length of delay can be determinative, and, in that context, 
the High Court observed that the quantum of delay is not 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 15 of 58 
 
material.  She pointed out that the total delay in execution of 
the death sentence, in this case, starting from the date of filing 
of mercy petitions till the date of issuance of execution 
warrants, was three years, eleven months and fifteen days. 
18. 
The learned counsel for the convicts submitted that the 
poor economic condition of the convicts was not considered by 
the Hon’ble Governor of the State of Maharashtra and the 
Hon’ble President of India.  Even the fact of relatively young 
ages of the convicts has not been considered while deciding the 
mercy petitions.  In the facts of the case, delay post the 
rejection of the mercy petitions will have to be treated as 
executive delay as there was a gross delay in doing 
the ministerial act of issuing execution warrants. 
19. 
The learned counsel also submitted that the finding of the 
High Court regarding keeping the convicts in solitary 
confinement is just and proper, and no interference is called 
for with that finding.  
CONSIDERATION  
LEGAL POSITION 
20. 
Law on the subject has been laid down in the case of 
Triveniben3 by a Constitution Bench. G.L. Oza, J. rendered 
the main opinion for himself and on behalf of three other 
Hon’ble Judges.  The controversy which led to a reference to 
the Constitution Bench has been set out in the majority 
judgment in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, which read thus: 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 16 of 58 
 
“1. These matters came up before us 
because of the conflict in the two decisions 
of 
this 
Court: 
(i) T.V. 
Vatheeswaran v. State of T.N. [(1983) 2 
SCC 68: 1983 SCC (Cri) 342 : (1983) 2 SCR 
348], Sher Singh v. State of Punjab [(1983) 
2 SCC 344: 1983 SCC (Cri) 461 : (1983) 2 
SCR 582] and observations in the case 
of Javed 
Ahmed 
Abdul 
Hamid 
Pawala v. State of Maharashtra [(1985) 1 
SCC 275: 1984 SCC (Cri) 653 : (1985) 2 
SCR 8]. In Vatheeswaran case [(1983) 2 
SCC 68: 1983 SCC (Cri) 342 : (1983) 2 SCR 
348] a Bench of two Judges of this Court 
held that two years delay in execution of 
the sentence after the judgment of the trial 
court will entitle the condemned prisoner 
to ask for commutation of his sentence of 
death to imprisonment for life. The court 
observed that: [SCC p. 79: SCC (Cri) p. 353, 
para 21] 
‘Making all reasonable allowance 
for the time necessary for appeal 
and consideration of reprieve, we 
think that delay exceeding two 
years in the execution of a 
sentence of death should be 
considered sufficient to entitle 
the person under sentence of 
death to invoke Article 21 and 
demand the quashing of the 
sentence of death.’ 
2. In Sher Singh case [(1983) 2 SCC 344: 
1983 SCC (Cri) 461 : (1983) 2 SCR 582] 
which was a decision of a three-Judges’ 
Bench it was held that a condemned 
prisoner has a right of fair procedure at all 
stages, trial, sentence and incarceration 
but delay alone is not good enough for 
commutation and two years rule could not 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 17 of 58 
 
be laid down in cases of delay. It was held 
that the court in the context of the nature 
of offence and delay could consider the 
question 
of 
commutation 
of 
death 
sentence. The court observed: [SCC p. 356 
: SCC (Cri) p. 473, para 19] 
‘Apart from the fact that the rule 
of two years runs in the teeth of 
common experience as regards 
the time generally occupied by 
proceedings in the High Court, 
the Supreme Court and before the 
executive authorities, we are of 
the opinion that no absolute or 
unqualified rule can be laid down 
that in every case in which there 
is a long delay in the execution of 
a death sentence, the sentence 
must 
be 
substituted 
by 
the 
sentence of life imprisonment. 
There are several other factors 
which must be taken into account 
while considering the question as to 
whether the death sentence should 
be vacated. A convict is undoubtedly 
entitled to pursue all remedies 
lawfully open to him to get rid of the 
sentence of death imposed upon 
him and indeed, there is no one, be 
he blind, lame, starving or suffering 
from a terminal illness, who does 
not want to live.’ 
It was further observed: [SCC p. 357 : SCC 
(Cri) p. 474, para 20] 
‘Finally, 
and 
that 
is 
no 
less 
important, the nature of the offence, 
the diverse circumstances attendant 
upon it, its impact upon the 
contemporary 
society 
and 
the 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 18 of 58 
 
question whether the motivation 
and pattern of the crime are such as 
are likely to lead to its repetition, if 
the death sentence is vacated, are 
matters which must enter into the 
verdict as to whether the sentence 
should be vacated for the reason 
that its execution is delayed. The 
substitution of the death sentence 
by a sentence of life imprisonment 
cannot follow by the application of 
the two years' formula, as a matter 
of quod erat demonstrandum.’ 
3. In Javed case [(1985) 1 SCC 275: 1984 
SCC (Cri) 653 : (1985) 2 SCR 8] it was 
observed that the condemned man who 
had suffered more than two years and nine 
months and was repenting and there was 
nothing adverse against him in the jail 
records, this period of two years and nine 
months with the sentence of death heavily 
weighing on his mind will entitle him for 
commutation of sentence of death into 
imprisonment for life. It is because of this 
controversy 
that 
the 
matter 
was 
referred to a five-Judges' Bench and 
hence it is before us.” 
                      (emphasis added) 
Ultimately, in paragraph 23, the Constitution Bench held thus: 
“23. So 
far 
as 
our 
conclusions 
are 
concerned we had delivered our order on 
11-10-1988 and we had reserved the 
reasons to be given later. Accordingly in the 
light 
of 
the 
discussions 
above 
our 
conclusion is as recorded in our order 
dated 11-10-1988 [Triveniben v. State of 
Gujarat, (1988) 4 SCC 574: 1989 SCC (Cri) 
25], reproduced below: [SCC p. 576: SCC 
(Cri) pp. 26-27, para 2] 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 19 of 58 
 
‘Undue long delay in execution of 
the sentence of death will entitle 
the 
condemned 
person 
to 
approach this Court under Article 
32 but this Court will only 
examine the nature of delay 
caused and circumstances that 
ensued after sentence was finally 
confirmed by the judicial process 
and will have no jurisdiction to 
reopen the conclusions reached 
by 
the 
court 
while 
finally 
maintaining 
the 
sentence 
of 
death. This Court, however, may 
consider 
the 
question 
of 
inordinate delay in the light of all 
circumstances of the case to 
decide whether the execution of 
sentence should be carried out or 
should 
be 
altered 
into 
imprisonment for life. No fixed 
period of delay could be held to 
make the sentence of death 
inexecutable and to this extent 
the 
decision 
in Vatheeswaran 
case [(1983) 2 SCC 68: 1983 SCC 
(Cri) 342 : (1983) 2 SCR 348] 
cannot be said to lay down the 
correct law and therefore to that 
extent stands overruled.’’ 
             (emphasis added) 
In paragraph 16, the Constitution Bench held that while 
considering the delay, the period consumed in the judicial 
process culminating in confirmation of the death sentence 
should not be considered. K. Jagannatha Shetty, J, rendered a 
concurring opinion.  In paragraphs 75 and 76 of his opinion, it 
was observed thus: 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 20 of 58 
 
“75. As between funeral fire and mental 
worry, it is the latter which is more 
devastating, for, funeral fire burns only the 
dead body while the mental worry burns 
the living one. This mental torment may 
become acute when the judicial verdict is 
finally set against the accused. Earlier to it, 
there is every reason for him to hope for 
acquittal. That hope is extinguished after 
the final verdict. If, therefore, there is 
inordinate delay in execution, the 
condemned prisoner is entitled to come 
to the court requesting to examine 
whether it is just and fair to allow the 
sentence of death to be executed. 
76. What should be done by the court is 
the next point for consideration. It is 
necessary 
to 
emphasise 
that 
the 
jurisdiction of the court at this stage is 
extremely limited. If the court wants to 
have a look at the grievance as to delay, it 
is needless to state, that there should not 
be any delay either in listing or in disposal 
of the matter. The person who complains 
about the delay in the execution should not 
be put to further delay. The matter, 
therefore, must be expeditiously and on top 
priority basis, disposed of. The court while 
examining the matter, for the reasons 
already stated, cannot take into account 
the time utilised in the judicial proceedings 
up to the final verdict. The court also 
cannot take into consideration the time 
taken for disposal of any petition filed by or 
on behalf of the accused either under 
Article 226 or under Article 32 of the 
Constitution after the final judgment 
affirming the conviction and sentence. The 
court may only consider whether there 
was undue long delay in disposing of 
mercy petition; whether the State was 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 21 of 58 
 
guilty of dilatory conduct and whether 
the delay was for no reason at all. The 
inordinate delay, may be a significant 
factor, but that by itself cannot render 
the execution unconstitutional. Nor it 
can be divorced from the dastardly and 
diabolical circumstances of the crime 
itself. The court has still to consider as 
observed in Sher Singh case [(1983) 2 SCC 
344: 1983 SCC (Cri) 461 : (1983) 2 SCR 
582] : [SCR p. 596: SCC p. 357: SCC (Cri) 
p. 474, para 20]” 
                     (emphasis added) 
21. 
Thereafter, a Bench of three Hon’ble Judges in the case 
of Shatrughan Chauhan & Anr.4 dealt with the same issue. 
Paragraphs 44 to 49 of the decision are material, which read 
thus: 
“44. In view of the above, we hold that 
undue long delay in execution of 
sentence of death will entitle the 
condemned prisoner to approach this 
Court under Article 32. However, this 
Court 
will 
only 
examine 
the 
circumstances surrounding the delay 
that has occurred and those that have 
ensued after the sentence was finally 
confirmed by the judicial process. This 
Court cannot reopen the conclusion 
already reached but may consider the 
question of inordinate delay to decide 
whether the execution of sentence 
should be carried out or should be 
altered into imprisonment for life. 
45. Keeping a convict in suspense while 
consideration of his mercy petition by 
the President for many years is certainly 
an agony for him/her. It creates adverse 
physical conditions and psychological 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 22 of 58 
 
stresses on the convict under sentence 
of death. Indisputably, this Court, while 
considering 
the 
rejection 
of 
the 
clemency petition by the President, 
under Article 32 read with Article 21 of 
the Constitution, cannot excuse the 
agonising delay caused to the convict 
only on the basis of the gravity of the 
crime. 
46. India has been a signatory to the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
1948 as well as to the United Nations 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
1966. Both these conventions contain 
provisions outlawing cruel and degrading 
treatment and/or punishment. Pursuant 
to 
the 
judgment 
of 
this 
Court 
in Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan [(1997) 6 
SCC 241 : 1997 SCC (Cri) 932] , 
international covenants to which India is a 
party are a part of domestic law unless they 
are contrary to a specific law in force. It is 
this expression (“cruel and degrading 
treatment and/or punishment”) which has 
ignited 
the 
philosophy 
of Vatheeswaran [T.V.Vatheeswaran v. Sta
te of T.N., (1983) 2 SCC 68 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 
342] and the cases which follow it. It is in 
this light, the Indian cases, particularly, 
the 
leading 
case 
of Triveniben [Triveniben v. State 
of 
Gujarat, (1989) 1 SCC 678 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 
248] 
has 
been 
followed 
in 
the 
Commonwealth countries. It is useful to 
refer the following foreign judgments which 
followed 
the 
proposition: 
(i) Pratt v. Attorney 
General 
for 
Jamaica [(1994) 2 AC 1 : (1993) 3 WLR 995 
: (1993) 4 All ER 769 (PC)], (ii) Catholic 
Commission for Justice & Peace in 
Zimbabwe v. Attorney General [(1993) 4 SA 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 23 of 58 
 
239 (Zimbabwe SC)] , (iii) Soering v. United 
Kingdom [ Application No. 14038 of 1988: 
(1989) 
11 
EHRR 
439], 
(iv) Attorney 
General v. Susan Kigula [ Constitutional 
Appeal No. 3 of 2006, decided on 21-1-
2009 
(Uganda 
SC)], 
(v) Herman 
Mejia v. Attorney General [ AD 2006 Action 
No. 296, decided on 11-6-2001 (Belize SC)]. 
47. It is clear that after the completion of 
the judicial process, if the convict files a 
mercy petition to the Governor/President, 
it is incumbent on the authorities to 
dispose of the same expeditiously. Though 
no time-limit can be fixed for the 
Governor and the President, it is the 
duty of the executive to expedite the 
matter at every stage viz. calling for the 
records, orders and documents filed in 
the court, preparation of the note for 
approval of the Minister concerned, and 
the 
ultimate 
decision 
of 
the 
constitutional authorities. This Court, 
in Triveniben [Triveniben v. State 
of 
Gujarat, (1989) 1 SCC 678: 1989 SCC 
(Cri) 248] , further held that in doing so, 
if it is established that there was 
prolonged delay in the execution of 
death sentence, it is an important and 
relevant consideration for determining 
whether the sentence should be allowed 
to be executed or not. 
48. Accordingly, if there is undue, 
unexplained and inordinate delay in 
execution due to pendency of mercy 
petitions or the executive as well as the 
constitutional authorities have failed to 
take note of/consider the relevant 
aspects, this Court is well within its 
powers under Article 32 to hear the 
grievance of the convict and commute 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 24 of 58 
 
thone 
death 
sentence 
into 
life 
imprisonment 
 
this 
ground 
alone 
however, only after satisfying that the 
delay was not caused at the instance of 
the accused himself. To this extent, the 
jurisprudence has developed in the light of 
the mandate given in our Constitution as 
well as various Universal Declarations and 
directions issued by the United Nations. 
49. The procedure prescribed by law, 
which deprives a person of his life and 
liberty must be just, fair and reasonable 
and such procedure mandates humane 
conditions of detention preventive or 
punitive. 
In 
this 
line, 
although 
the 
petitioners were sentenced to death based 
on the procedure established by law, the 
inexplicable delay on account of executive 
is 
inexcusable. 
Since 
it 
is 
well 
established that Article 21 of the 
Constitution does not end with the 
pronouncement of sentence but extends 
to the stage of execution of that 
sentence, as already asserted, prolonged 
delay in execution of sentence of death 
has a dehumanising effect on the 
accused. Delay caused by circumstances 
beyond the prisoners' control mandates 
commutation of death sentence. In fact, 
in Vatheeswaran [T.V.Vatheeswaran v. Sta
te of T.N., (1983) 2 SCC 68 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 
342] , particularly, in para 10, it was 
elaborated 
where 
amongst 
other 
authorities, the minority view of Lords 
Scarman and Brightman in the 1982 Privy 
Council case of Riley v. Attorney General of 
Jamaica [Riley v. Attorney 
General 
of 
Jamaica, (1983) 1 AC 719 : (1982) 3 WLR 
557 : (1982) 3 All ER 469 : 1982 Cri Law 
Review 
679 
(PC)], 
by 
quoting: 
(Vatheeswaran

case [T.V.Vatheeswaran v. State of T.N.,

SCC p. 72) 
“10. ‘… Sentence of death is one 
thing: sentence of death followed by 
lengthy 
imprisonment 
prior 
to 
execution 
is 
another.’”

Jamaica, (1983) 1 AC 719 : (1982) 3 
WLR 557 : (1982) 3 All ER 469 : 
1982 Cri Law Review 679 (PC)] , AC 
p. 735 B) 
(emphasis supplied) 
The appropriate relief in cases where the 
execution of death sentence is delayed, the 
Court held, is to vacate the sentence of 
death. In para 13, the Court made it clear 
that Articles 14, 19 and 21 supplement one 
another and the right which was spelled 
out 
from 
the 
Constitution 
was 
a 
substantive right of the convict and not 
merely a matter of procedure established 
by law. This was the consequence of the 
judgment in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of 
India [Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, 
(1978) 1 SCC 248] which made the content 
of Article 21 substantive as distinguished 
from merely procedural.” 
                  (emphasis added) 
In paragraph 244, the Bench proceeded to hold thus: 
“244. It 
is 
well 
established 
that 
exercising of power under Articles 
72/161 
by 
the 
President 
or 
the 
Governor is a constitutional obligation 
and not a mere prerogative. Considering 
the 
high 
status 
of 
office, 
the 
Constitution Framers did not stipulate 
any outer time-limit for disposing of the 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 26 of 58 
 
mercy petitions under the said Articles, 
which means it should be decided within 
reasonable time. However, when the 
delay caused in disposing of the mercy 
petitions is seen to be unreasonable, 
unexplained and exorbitant, it is the 
duty of this Court to step in and 
consider this aspect. Right to seek for 
mercy under Articles 72/161 of the 
Constitution is a constitutional right 
and not at the discretion or whims of the 
executive. Every constitutional duty must 
be fulfilled with due care and diligence, 
otherwise judicial interference is the 
command of the Constitution for upholding 
its values.” 
             
 
 (emphasis added) 
 
 
This Court also issued several other directions regarding 
the procedure to be followed in placing mercy petitions before 
the Hon’ble Governor or the Hon’ble President of India.   
22. 
The decision of this Court in the case of B.A.Umesh7 does 
not make a departure from the law laid down in the case of 
Shatrughan Chauhan & Anr4.  On the contrary, paragraphs 
44, 47 and 48 of the decision have been quoted therein with 
approval. We have carefully perused several other decisions of 
this Court which have been rendered in the facts of the case 
before this Court. The propositions laid down in these decisions 
can be summarized as under:  
(i) Undue, unexplained and inordinate delay in 
execution of the sentence of death will entitle the 
convict to approach this Court under Article 32.  But 
this Court will only examine the nature of the delay 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 27 of 58 
 
caused and circumstances that ensued after the 
judicial process finally confirmed the sentence and 
will have no jurisdiction to reopen the conclusions 
reached by the court while finally maintaining the 
sentence of death. This Court, however, may consider 
the question of inordinate delay in the light of all 
circumstances of the case to decide whether the 
execution of sentence should be carried out or should 
be altered into imprisonment for life. No fixed period 
of delay could be held to make the sentence of death 
inexecutable.  
(ii) Keeping a convict sentenced to death in suspense 
while considering his mercy petitions by the Governor 
or the President for an inordinately long time is 
certainly agony for him/her. It creates adverse 
physical conditions and psychological stress on the 
convict under sentence of death.   Therefore, this 
Court, while considering the delay in the disposal of 
clemency petitions by the highest constitutional 
authorities, while exercising its jurisdiction under 
Article 32 read with Article 21 of the Constitution, 
cannot excuse the agonising delay caused to the 
convict only based on the gravity of the crime; and 
(iii) It is well established that Article 21 of the 
Constitution does not end with the pronouncement of 
the sentence but extends to the execution stage of that 
sentence. An inordinate delay in the execution of 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 28 of 58 
 
the sentence of death has a dehumanising effect on 
the 
accused. 
An 
inordinate 
delay 
caused 
by 
circumstances 
beyond 
the 
prisoners' 
control 
mandates the commutation of a death sentence.    
23.  In paragraph 16 of the decision of this Court in the case 
of Triveniben3, the Constitution Bench held that while 
considering the delay in the execution of the death sentence, 
the period consumed in the judicial process culminating in the 
confirmation of the death sentence should not be taken into 
consideration.  The reason for the said conclusion is that only 
after the judicial process in the form of the judgment of this 
Court in appeal / special leave petition arising out of the order 
of conviction does the order of death sentence become final.  
Therefore, the period required for judicial consideration cannot 
be termed as a delay in the execution of the death sentence, as 
till the conclusion of judicial proceedings arising out of the 
order of conviction, a sentence of death does not attain finality. 
The question of execution thereof arises only when the death 
sentence becomes final.  
24. 
We may refer to Sections 413 and 414 of the CrPC, which 
read thus: 
“413. Execution of order passed under 
section 368.— When in a case submitted 
to the High Court for the confirmation of a 
sentence of death, the Court of Session 
receives the order of confirmation or other 
order of the High Court thereon, it shall 
cause such order to be carried into effect 
by issuing a warrant or taking such other 
steps as may be necessary.  

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 29 of 58 
 
 
414. Execution of sentence of death 
passed by High Court.— When a sentence 
of death is passed by the High Court in 
appeal or in revision, the Court of Session 
shall, on receiving the order of the High 
Court, cause the sentence to be carried into 
effect by issuing a warrant.” 
 
There are identical provisions in the BNSS in the form of 
Sections 453 and 454. These provisions constitute a vital 
safeguard. These provisions ensure that the execution of the 
death sentence takes place only after all remedies available to 
the convicts are exhausted.  The executive cannot execute the 
death sentence unless the Sessions Court issues a warrant. 
25. 
The proceedings for issuing a warrant for executing a 
death sentence under Sections 413 and 414 of the CrPC do not 
require any judicial adjudication.  Before issuing the warrant, 
the Sessions Court must satisfy itself that the order of death 
sentence has attained finality and the review/curative or mercy 
petitions, if filed, have been finally rejected.  Before issuing a 
warrant, the Sessions Court has to issue notice to the convict 
so that even the convict can state whether any other 
proceedings are pending before the Courts or Constitutional 
authorities. In a given case, the convict may not be interested 
in pursuing remedies. The Sessions Court can verify this aspect 
after issuing a notice to the convict. The Sessions Court, in 
such a case, must appraise the convict of the remedies 
available and, if required, provide legal aid to enable the convict 
to take recourse to such remedies. After the convict has been 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 30 of 58 
 
made aware of the remedies available, reasonable time be 
granted to the convict to consider, weigh and even consult a 
member of his family or friend to finally take a decision on 
adopting remedies as the possibility of thinking logically and 
rationally may be impeded or hampered because of the 
situation being faced by the convict.  The Sessions Court can 
issue a warrant only after providing such reasonable time to 
the convict and after satisfying itself that the convict has taken 
a conscious decision of not pursuing the available remedies. 
The reasonable time can be of seven days. The Sessions Court 
can direct the counselling of the convict if it is not satisfied that 
the decision is a well-informed, considered and conscious 
decision. If such a procedure is followed, it enables the convict 
to take recourse to the available legal remedy.  Moreover, if an 
order of issue of warrant of execution is passed after notice to 
the convict, it enables the convict to challenge the order of 
issuing a warrant of execution. But after the convict exhausts 
all remedies, including filing mercy petitions or after the 
Sessions Court is satisfied that the convict has taken a 
conscious decision of not availing the remedies, the execution 
warrant must be issued without any delay.  It is the 
responsibility of the trial court to take up and conclude the 
proceedings of issuing a warrant of execution as expeditiously 
as possible.  The trial court must give necessary out of turn 
priority.  
26. 
After the decisions on mercy petitions, if there is an 
inordinate and unexplained delay in actual execution for no 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 31 of 58 
 
fault on the part of the convict, there is no reason why the 
principles set out in paragraph 23 should not apply. The 
principles will also apply to a case where there is a long and 
unexplained delay on the part of the Sessions Court in issuing 
the warrant of execution in accordance with Sections 413 and 
414 of CrPC. After the order of rejection of mercy petitions is 
communicated to a convict, the sword of Damocles cannot be 
kept hanging on him for inordinately long time. This can be 
very agonising, both mentally and physically. Such inordinate 
and unreasonable delay will violate his rights under Article 21 
of the Constitution. In such a case, this Court will be justified 
in commuting the death penalty into life imprisonment.  
27. 
A convict can invoke even the jurisdiction of a High Court 
under Article 226 of the Constitution if there is an inordinate 
and unexplained delay in the execution of the death sentence 
post-confirmation of the sentence. The High Court will apply 
the same principles summarised in paragraphs 22 to 25. 
28. 
No hard and fast rule can be laid down as regards the 
length of delay, which can be said to be inordinate.  It all 
depends on the facts of the case. In a given case, a delay of two 
years may not be fatal. In another case, a delay of six months 
can be a ground to commute sentence. The terms “undue” or 
“inordinate” cannot be interpreted by applying the rules of 
mathematics.  The Courts, in such cases, deal with human 
issues and the effect of the delay on a particular convict.  What 
delay is inordinate must depend on the facts of the case. For 
example, if a convict is more than seventy years old and is 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 32 of 58 
 
suffering from multiple ailments, an unexplained delay of even 
six months in deciding a mercy petition can amount to 
a violation of Article 21.  Ultimately, the Courts will have to 
determine the effect of delay in the light of the principles laid 
down as aforesaid, considering the facts of the case before it.  
APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES TO THE FACTS OF THE 
CASE 
29. 
In this case, there is a delay in the following three stages:  
i. On 10th July 2015, the convicts filed mercy 
petitions addressed to the Hon’ble Governor of the 
State of Maharashtra, which were rejected on 29th 
March 2016.  This is the first part of the delay; 
ii. On 11th June 2016, mercy petitions were addressed 
by the convicts to the Hon’ble President of India, 
which were rejected on 26th May 2017. This is the 
second part of the delay, and 
iii. The third part of the delay started on 19th June 
2017, when the Superintendent of Prison informed 
the learned Sessions Judge, Pune, about the 
rejection of mercy petitions by the Hon’ble President 
of India.  Ultimately, it was only on 10th April 
2019 that the learned Sessions Court, Pune, issued 
the warrants for the execution of the death 
sentence.     
Thus, from 10th July 2015 till 10th April 2019, time was 
consumed in deciding the mercy petitions filed before the 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 33 of 58 
 
Hon’ble Governor of the State and the Hon’ble President of 
India, and in issuing warrants for executing the death 
sentence.

Mercy petitions rejected by 
the Hon’ble Governor. 
64 days 
From the above table, it appears that nothing was done by the 
Home Department of the State Government for five months 
(152 days) after receiving confirmation that the convicts had 
not preferred a review petition. Further, a perusal of the note 
prepared for the benefit of the Hon’ble Governor shows that it 
consists of three and a half pages.  The recommendation is in 
three lines in the last paragraph.  It is interesting to note that 
while forwarding the mercy petitions along with the letter dated 
16th July 2015, the following documents were sent to the Home 
Department: 
i. Nominal roll of the convicts; 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 35 of 58 
 
ii. Medical report of mental and physical health; 
iii. A summary of crime; 
iv. Warrant of conviction issued by the Sessions Court; 
and 
v. A copy of the judgment of the High Court confirming 
the death sentence and the order/judgment of this 
Court. 
The note appears to be based only on these documents, which 
were available to the Home Department in July 2015.  A lot of 
time was wasted on correspondence made by various officers. 
All this was avoidable. Immediately upon receipt of the mercy 
petitions, all the required information/documents ought to 
have been called for by the Home Ministry. That was not done. 
Perhaps the officers in the Home Ministry showed a lack of 
sensitivity.  Ultimately, on 29th March 2016, mercy petitions 
were rejected by the Hon’ble Governor.  Thus, the delay of 5 
months between 16th July 2015 and 25th January 2016 is 
unexplained and unjustified.

A period of about three months taken by the Hon’ble President 
cannot amount to undue delay.  However, the delay from 28th 
April 2016, when the mercy petitions were forwarded to the 
Under Secretary (GOI) till 22nd February 2017, is entirely 
unexplained and unwarranted.

since

33. 
When the mercy petitions were pending, the Sessions 
Court could not have issued a warrant to execute the death 
sentence.  The most straightforward procedure that the State 
Government could have followed was to apply through the 
Public Prosecutor before the learned Sessions Court on the 
judicial side by placing on record the rejection of the mercy 
petitions and seeking the issuance of warrants for the 
execution. Even the Sessions Court ought to have acted upon 
the several letters from the Prison and issued notice to the 
State Government.  However, that was not done. Thus, there 
was an inordinate delay in issuing warrants for executing 
the death sentence.  This delay from June 2017 to April 2019 
was entirely avoidable.  This also is a delay post-confirmation 
of the death sentence by this Court, which must be taken into 
consideration.  
THE EFFECT OF THE DELAY 
34. 
Thus, on facts, it can be said that there was undue and 
unexplained delay at all three stages. The undue delays have 
occurred in placing the mercy petitions before the Hon’ble 
Governor for the State and the Hon’ble President of India.  In 
the facts of the case, the inordinate delay is on the part of the 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 44 of 58 
 
executive and not on the part of the Constitutional 
functionaries.  
35. 
 The time consumed from the filing of mercy petitions 
before the Hon’ble Governor to the date of issue of the execution 
of warrants by the learned Sessions Court, Pune, is of three 
years, eleven months and fourteen days.  Even if we exclude 
the time actually taken by the constitutional functionaries to 
decide mercy petitions, still the delay will be of more than three 
years.  The Court must consider the cumulative effect of the 
delays at three stages after taking into consideration the facts 
of the case. The reason is that in a given case, there may not 
be an inordinate delay in one stage, but there may be an 
inordinate delay in two other stages.  The only conclusion in 
this case is that the delay is unexplained and inordinate.  
Therefore, it is impossible to find fault with the view taken by 
the High Court that there was a violation of the rights of the 
convicts guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of 
India. Therefore, the commutation of the death sentence to a 
fixed term sentence of thirty-five years by the High Court 
cannot be faulted. 
DUTY OF THE EXECUTIVE AND THE SESSIONS COURT 
36. 
The Executive must promptly deal with the mercy 
petitions filed by the convicts of the death sentence.  In this 
case, the approach of the Executive, and especially the State 
Government, has been casual and negligent. Even the Sessions 
Court ought to have been pro-active. When the delay from the 
date of filing of mercy petitions till the date of issue of a warrant 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 45 of 58 
 
of execution is inordinate and unexplained, the right of the 
convicts guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India 
is violated.  This right must be upheld, and it is the duty of the 
Constitutional Courts to do so.   
37. 
We must also consider the rights of the victims of the 
offences to justice. Their right is to ensure that there is a 
prompt and proper investigation. However, we hasten to add 
that there is no right vested in the victim to insist on imposing 
capital punishment.  The law must be enforced with all the 
vigour, and the Executive Branch of the State Government 
cannot show laxity in implementing the orders of conviction 
passed by the competent Courts. The very purpose of passing 
orders of sentence cannot be allowed to be defeated. We cannot 
ignore the effect of the laxity shown by law enforcement 
agencies on society.  Therefore, we propose to issue directions 
to ensure that there are no administrative delays in dealing 
with the mercy petitions or issuing warrants for execution of 
death sentence. 
DIRECTIONS TO CURB THE DELAYS  
38. 
The first direction which we propose to issue is regarding 
the nature of documents which ought to be immediately 
forwarded with the mercy petitions.  The second direction we 
propose is that the State Government must set up a dedicated 
cell in either the Home Department or Prison Department to 
ensure prompt and expeditious processing of the mercy 
petitions.  We also propose to direct the State Government to 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 46 of 58 
 
issue executive orders to ensure prompt processing of the 
mercy petitions. 
39. 
Now, we come to the role of the Sessions Court.  There 
cannot be any dispute that unless a warrant is issued for the 
execution of the death sentence under Section 413 or Section 
414 of the CrPC, the death sentence cannot be executed.  On 
this aspect, we must refer to a decision of this Court in the case 
of Shabnam v. Union of India9 and, in particular, paragraph 
21.  This Court held that the procedure laid down by the High 
Court of Allahabad in its decision in the case of People’s Union 
for Democratic Rights (PUDR) v. Union of India & Ors.10 is 
in consonance with Article 21 of the Constitution of India. 
Therefore, while executing the death sentence, it is mandatory 
to follow the procedure laid down by the Allahabad High Court 
in the decision mentioned above.  The decision of the Allahabad 
High Court can be summarised as follows: 
i. The principles of natural justice must be drawn into 
the provisions of Sections 413 and 414 of the CrPC, 
and sufficient notice ought to be given to the convict 
before issuance of a warrant for the execution of 
the death sentence by the Sessions Court, which 
would enable the convict to consult an advocate and 
represent him in the proceedings; 
ii. The warrant for the execution of the death sentence 
must specify the exact date and time of the execution 
 
9  (2015) 6 SCC 702 
10  2015 SCC OnLine All 143 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 47 of 58 
 
and not a range of dates within which the death 
sentence will be executed, which places the convict in 
a state of uncertainty.  A reasonable time must be 
provided between the date of the order of issue of 
the execution warrant and the date fixed for actual 
execution so that the convict gets an opportunity to 
adopt a remedy against the warrant and to have 
a final meeting with the family members; 
iii. A copy of the warrant must be immediately supplied 
to the convict, and  
iv. After issuing a notice and before issuing a warrant of 
execution, if the convict is not represented by an 
advocate, legal aid should be provided to him. 
As held by this Court, the procedure described above is in 
conformity with Article 21 of the Constitution of India. 
40. 
To avoid the situation that arose in this case, we need to 
elaborate further upon the directions already issued by the 
Allahabad High Court.  When a death sentence is confirmed or 
the High Court imposes a death sentence, a writ/order of the 
High Court is always sent to the Sessions Court.  When the 
Sessions Court receives intimation of such order, the disposed 
of sessions case must be taken on board by the Sessions Court, 
and 
notice 
should 
be 
issued 
to 
the 
Public 
Prosecutor/investigating agency to ascertain whether the 
convicts have challenged the judgment of the High Court.  
Depending upon the rules of procedure of the concerned court, 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 48 of 58 
 
the proceeding can be numbered as a Misc. Application in the 
disposed of case.  If the Public Prosecutor informs the Sessions 
Court that the challenge before this Court is pending, the 
Sessions Court should pass no further order.  As soon as the 
intimation of confirmation of the death sentence by this Court 
is received, the disposed of case should be taken on the cause 
list and notice should be issued to the convicts through the Jail 
Superintendent calling upon the convicts to disclose whether 
they intend to file review petition and/or mercy petition.  It is 
the duty of the State/investigating agency to inform the 
Sessions Court about the outcome of the review and mercy 
petitions by filing a proper application in the disposed of case. 
The 
reason 
is 
that 
it 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
State/investigating agency to ensure that the death penalty is 
executed.  To ensure that there is no delay, the Sessions Court, 
after confirmation of the death sentence by the Court, shall 
periodically fix dates in the disposed of case so that an up-to-
date report can be submitted on behalf of the State 
Government/investigating 
agency 
through 
the 
Public 
Prosecutor. 
 
It 
will 
be 
the 
duty 
of 
the 
State 
Government/investigating agency to make an application and 
inform the Sessions Court about the rejection of the mercy 
petitions made to the Constitutional authorities so that the 
Sessions Court can take further steps.  Such information shall 
be furnished by making a regular application on the judicial 
side and not by sending a letter.  After such an application is 
filed before the Court, notice should be issued to the convicts 
informing them that the Court is proposing to issue a warrant 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 49 of 58 
 
for executing the death sentence.  After hearing the convict 
and/or his advocate or legal aid advocate provided to the 
convict, the Court should pass an order directing issuance of 
the warrant of execution, a copy of which shall be immediately 
forwarded to the convict.  As directed earlier by this Court, the 
warrant must contain a precise date and time of execution.  
The time should be fixed in such a manner that the convict gets 
at least a period of fifteen clear days from the date of receipt of 
the warrant of execution of the death sentence and the actual 
date of execution to enable him to take recourse to legal 
remedies or to allow him to meet his relatives finally.   
41. 
As we are confirming the impugned judgment on the 
ground of inordinate and unexplained delay in the execution of 
the death sentence, it is not necessary to decide the controversy 
whether the convicts were kept in solitary confinement even 
before the rejection of the mercy petitions. 
OUR CONCLUSIONS  
42. 
We hold that:-   
(i) 
Undue, unexplained and inordinate delay in 
execution of the sentence of death will entitle the 
convict to approach this Court under Article 32. 
However, this Court will only examine the nature of 
the delay caused and circumstances that ensued 
after the judicial process finally confirmed the 
sentence and will have no jurisdiction to reopen the 
conclusions reached by the Court while finally 
maintaining the sentence of death. This Court, 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 50 of 58 
 
however, may consider the question of inordinate 
delay in the light of all circumstances of the case to 
decide whether the execution of sentence should be 
carried 
out 
or 
should 
be 
commuted 
to 
imprisonment for life; 
(ii)  Keeping a convict in suspense while considering his 
mercy petitions by the Governor or the President for 
an inordinately long time will certainly cause agony 
to him/her. It creates adverse physical conditions 
and psychological stress on the convict.  Therefore, 
this Court, while exercising its jurisdiction under 
Article 32 read with Article 21 of the Constitution, 
must consider the effect of inordinate delay in 
disposal of the clemency petition by the highest 
Constitutional authorities and cannot excuse the 
agonising delay caused only on the basis of the 
gravity of the crime; 
(iii) It is well established that Article 21 of the 
Constitution does not end with the pronouncement 
of the sentence but extends to the stage of execution 
of that sentence. An inordinate delay in the 
execution of the sentence of death has a 
dehumanising effect on the accused. An inordinate 
and unexplained delay caused by circumstances 
beyond the prisoners' control mandates the 
commutation of a death sentence; 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 51 of 58 
 
(iv) The above principles will also apply to a case where 
there is a long and unexplained delay on the part of 
the Sessions Court in issuing the warrant of 
execution in accordance with Section 413 or 
Section 414 of CrPC. After the order of rejection of 
mercy petitions is communicated to a convict, the 
sword of Damocles cannot be kept hanging on him 
for an inordinately long time. This can be very 
agonising, both mentally and physically. Such 
inordinate delay will violate his rights under Article 
21 of the Constitution. In such a case, this Court 
will be justified in commuting the death penalty into 
life imprisonment;  
(v)   No hard and fast rule can be laid down as regards 
the length of delay, which can be said to be 
inordinate.  It all depends on the facts of the case. 
The terms “undue” or “inordinate” cannot be 
interpreted by applying the rules of mathematics.  
The Courts, in such cases, deal with human issues 
and the effect of the delay on individual convicts. 
What delay is inordinate must depend on the facts 
of the case;  
(vi)  A convict can invoke even the jurisdiction of a High 
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution in the 
event there is an inordinate and unexplained delay 
in the execution of the death sentence, post-
confirmation of the sentence. The same principles 

 Criminal Appeal Nos.2831 and 2832 of 2023 
 
 
Page 52 of 58 
 
will be applied by the High Court, which are 
summarised above; and,  
(vii) It is the duty of the Executive to promptly process 
the mercy petitions invoking Articles 72 or 161 of 
the Constitution and forward the petitions along 
with 
requisite 
documents 
to 
the 
concerned 
constitutional functionary without undue delay.
