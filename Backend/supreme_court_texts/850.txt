29.09.2019 registered with Police Station South Rohini, Delhi 
under Sections 376(2)(n) and 506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 
(“IPC” for short), the appellant is before this Court.  
 
3.  
Briefly stated the facts of the case are that the complainant 
lodged FIR No. 272 of 2019 dated 29.09.2019 registered at Police 
Station South Rohini, Delhi under Sections 376(2)(n) and 506 of 
the IPC. As per the said FIR, the complainant alleged that she was 
living with her brother and working at the Vodafone Call Centre. 
The appellant herein came in contact with the complainant in the 
year 2017 and they had a conversation on call and got to know each 
other. They first met in November 2017 and again in April 2018 at 
a park. The complainant further stated that in January 2019, the 
appellant found her address and had a forceful sexual relationship 
with her. It was further stated that the appellant used to threaten 
the complainant to have forceful sexual relationship with her. 
However, the appellant later denied to marry the complainant by 
giving excuses. Further, the appellant also refused that the 
complainant should meet his parents.

4.  
The complainant has also given her statement under Section 
164 CrPC. In the said statement, apart from reiterating the said 
allegations, she further stated that the appellant used to take the 
complainant to his room in Chhatarpur and have physical 
relationship with her.  After the conclusion of the investigation, 
charge-sheet dated 22.11.2019 was filed.  
 
5.  
Being aggrieved by the said criminal proceedings, the 
appellant approached the High Court of Delhi by filing CRL.M.C. 
No.6066 of 2019 under Section 482 CrPC seeking quashing of the 
FIR No. 272 of 2019 dated 29.09.2019. By the impugned order 
dated 16.10.2023, the High Court dismissed the said petition filed 
by the appellant. The High Court noted that the alleged relationship 
between the parties was not the outcome of consent on the part of 
the complainant and that allegations made in the FIR and in the 
statement made under Section 164 CrPC were sufficient to 
constitute alleged offences against the appellant. Hence the instant 
appeal.

6.  
We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and the 
learned ASG for the respondent State. 
 
7.  
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the contents 
of the FIR and MLC report do not disclose any cognizable offence. 
The parties were in a consensual relationship. The institution of the 
FIR was with the ulterior motive of retribution due to a personal 
vengeance. There are umpteen contradictions in the FIR, MLC 
report and the statement made by the complainant under Section 
164 CrPC. It was submitted that in the FIR dated 29.09.2019, the 
complainant stated that the appellant committed alleged forceful 
sexual acts on her in January 2019. However, in the MLC report 
dated 28.09.2019, she alleged that the incident of rape happened 
one week before the MLC. Further in the statement under Section 
164 CrPC, she stated that the appellant used to take her to his 
room in Chhatarpur and forcibly committed rape on her. Hence, 
there is inconsistency in her statements. Therefore, it was prayed 
that this Court may set aside the impugned order dated 16.10.2023 

 
 
 
Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl.) No.2793 of 2024                                     Page 5 of 15   
 
and quash the criminal proceedings pending against the appellant 
herein arising out of FIR No. 272 of 2019 dated 29.09.2019.  
 
8.  
Per contra, the learned ASG for the respondent-State 
contended that a prima facie case has been made out and that the 
statements made under Section 164 CrPC are sufficient to 
constitute offences levelled against the appellant. Both FIR and 
MLC reports state that the appellant had a physical relationship 
with the complainant on false promise of marriage. The appellant 
had also threatened the complainant to kill her brother if she 
refused to have physical relationship with him. Only because of the 
said threat, the complainant reported the incident nine months 
later. Hence, the learned ASG argued that the High Court, vide 
impugned order, was justified in dismissing the quashing petition 
filed by the appellant and prayed for the dismissal of the present 
appeal as well. 
 
9.  
During the course of the arguments, it was also brought to the 
notice of this Court that the appellant got married in 2019 and the 
complainant was also married in the year 2020.

10.  Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties 
and having perused the material on record, the only question that 
falls for our consideration is, whether, FIR No. 272 of 2019 dated 
29.09.2019 lodged against the appellant herein should be quashed. 
 
11.  In State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 
335, this Court formulated the parameters in terms of which the 
powers under Section 482 of CrPC could be exercised. While it is 
not necessary to revisit all these parameters, a few that are relevant 
to the present case may be set out. The Court held that quashing 
may be appropriate:  
“102. … 
 
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information 
report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their 
face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima 
facie constitute any offence or make out a case against 
the accused. 
  
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report 
and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do 
not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an 
investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of 
the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within 
the purview of Section 155(2).

x x x 
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended 
with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is 
maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for 
wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to 
spite him due to private and personal grudge.” 
 
 
12.  In the instant case the allegations in the FIR are under 
Sections 376(2)(n) and 506 IPC.  
 
13.  An offence of rape if established in terms of Section 375 is 
punishable under Section 376 of the IPC. In the present case, the 
second description of Section 376 is relevant which is set out below:  
“376. Punishment for rape. –  
1. Whoever, except in the cases provided for in sub-
section (2), commits rap, shall be punished with 
rigorous imprisonment of either description for a 
term which shall not be less than ten years, but 
which may extend to imprisonment for life, and 
shall also be liable to fine.  
 
2. Whoever, -  
x x x 
n.   commits rape repeatedly on the same woman, 
shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment 
for a term which shall not be less than ten years, 
but which may extend to imprisonment for life, 

 
 
 
Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl.) No.2793 of 2024                                     Page 8 of 15   
 
which shall mean imprisonment for the 
remainder of that person's natural life, and shall 
also be liable to fine.” 
 
14.  Further, Section 506 IPC speaks of criminal intimidation 
which is defines in Section 503 IPC. The said provisions read as 
under:-  
“503. Criminal intimidation.— Whoever threatens 
another with any injury to his person, reputation or 
property, or to the person or reputation of any one in whom 
that person is interested, with intent to cause alarm to that 
person, or to cause that person to do any act which he is 
not legally bound to do, or to omit to do any act which that 
person is legally entitled to do, as the means of avoiding 
the 
execution 
of 
such 
threat, 
commits 
criminal 
intimidation. 
 
Explanation.— A threat to injure the reputation of any 
deceased person in whom the person threatened is 
interested, is within this section. 
x x x 
506. Punishment for criminal intimidation.— Whoever 
commits, the offence of criminal intimidation shall be 
punished with imprisonment of either description for a 
term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with 
both; 
 
If threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, etc.— And 
if the threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, or to cause 
the destruction of any property by fire, or to cause an 
offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, or 
with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven 
years, or to impute, unchastity to a woman, shall be 

 
 
 
Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl.) No.2793 of 2024                                     Page 9 of 15   
 
punished with imprisonment of either description for a 
term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with 
both.” 
 
15.  Sub-section 2 of Section 376 is an exception to sub-section 1 
of the said provision. Sub-section 2, inter alia, states that 
whosoever commits rape repeatedly on the same woman, shall be 
punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be 
less than ten years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life, 
which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person’s 
natural life, and shall also be liable to fine.   
 
16.  Therefore, the question whether in the instant case the 
aforesaid offences were committed by the appellant within the 
meaning of the aforesaid provisions.  
 
17.  In the present case, the issue that had to be addressed by the 
High Court was whether, assuming all the allegations in the FIR are 
correct as they stand, an offence punishable under Sections 376 
and 506 IPC were made out. A bare perusal of the FIR reveals that 
the appellant and the complainant first came in contact in the year 

 
 
 
Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl.) No.2793 of 2024                                     Page 10 of 15   
 
2017 and established a relationship thereafter. The parties met 
multiple times at various places during the years 2017 and 2019, 
including at parks and their respective houses.  Although the 
complainant stated that the appellant had a forceful sexual 
relationship with her, neither did she stop meeting the appellant 
thereafter, nor did she file a criminal complaint during the said 
period. 
 
18.  It is inconceivable that the complainant would continue to 
meet the appellant or maintain a prolonged association or physical 
relationship with him in the absence of voluntary consent on her 
part. Moreover, it would have been improbable for the appellant to 
ascertain the complainant's residential address, as mentioned in 
the FIR unless such information had been voluntarily provided by 
the complainant herself. It is also revealed that, at one point, both 
parties had an intention to marry each other, though this plan 
ultimately did not materialize. The appellant and the complainant 
were in a consensual relationship. They are both educated adults. 
The complainant, after filing the FIR against the appellant, got 

 
 
 
Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl.) No.2793 of 2024                                     Page 11 of 15   
 
married in the year 2020 to some other person. Similarly, the 
appellant was also married in the year 2019. Possibly the marriage 
of the appellant in the year 2019 has led the complainant to file the 
FIR against him as they were in a consensual relationship till then.   
 
19.  In our view, taking the allegations in the FIR and the charge-
sheet as they stand, the crucial ingredients of the offence under 
Section 376 (2)(n) IPC are absent. A review of the FIR and the 
complainant's statement under Section 164 CrPC discloses no 
indication that any promise of marriage was extended at the outset 
of their relationship in 2017. Therefore, even if the prosecution's 
case is accepted at its face value, it cannot be concluded that the 
complainant engaged in a sexual relationship with the appellant 
solely on account of any assurance of marriage from the appellant. 
The relationship between the parties was cordial and also 
consensual in nature. A mere breakup of a relationship between a 
consenting couple cannot result in initiation of criminal 
proceedings. What was a consensual relationship between the 
parties at the initial stages cannot be given a colour of criminality 

 
 
 
Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl.) No.2793 of 2024                                     Page 12 of 15   
 
when the said relationship does not fructify into a marital 
relationship. Further, both parties are now married to someone else 
and have moved on in their respective lives. Thus, in our view, the 
continuation of the prosecution in the present case would amount 
to a gross abuse of the process of law. Therefore, no purpose would 
be served by continuing the prosecution. 
 
20.  The ingredients of criminal intimidation are threat to another 
person, inter alia, with any injury to his person, reputation with 
intent to cause alarm to that person or to cause that person to any 
act which he is not legally bound to do. In the instant case, as 
already noted, the relationship between the appellant and the 
complainant was consensual in nature. In fact, they wanted to 
fructify the relationship into marriage. It is in that context that they 
indulged in sexual activity. Therefore, there cannot be a case of 
criminal intimidation involved as against the complainant. We do 
not find that there was any threat caused to the complainant by the 
appellant when all along there was cordiality between them and it 
was only when the appellant got married in the year 2019 that the 

 
 
 
Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl.) No.2793 of 2024                                     Page 13 of 15   
 
complainant filed a complaint. In the circumstances, we do not 
think that the offence under Section 503 read with Section 506 of 
the IPC has been made out in the instant case.  
 
21.  As demonstrated in the above analysis, the facts as they 
stand, which are not in dispute, indicate that the ingredients of the 
offence under Sections 376 (2)(n) or 506 IPC are not established in 
the instant case. The High Court erred in concluding that there was 
no consent on the part of the complainant and therefore she was a 
victim of sexual assault over a period of time and therefore, 
proceeded to dismiss the application under Section 482 CrPC on a 
completely misconceived basis. The facts of the present case are 
appropriate for the High Court to have exercised the power available 
under Section 482 CrPC to prevent abuse of the court’s process by 
continuing the prosecution. 
 
22.  Recently this  Court in XXXX vs. State  of  Madhya  
Pradesh, (2024) 3 SCC 496 held that when the relationship 
between the parties was purely consensual and when the 

 
 
 
Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl.) No.2793 of 2024                                     Page 14 of 15   
 
complainant was aware of the consequences of her actions, the 
ingredients of the offence of rape were not made out. Similarly, in 
Pramod Suryabhan Pawar v. State of Maharashtra, (2019) 9 
SCC 608 arising out of identical facts, this Court has enumerated 
the following: 
“18. To summarise the legal position that emerges from the 
above cases, the “consent” of a woman with respect to 
Section 375 must involve an active and reasoned 
deliberation towards the proposed act. To establish 
whether the “consent” was vitiated by a “misconception of 
fact” arising out of a promise to marry, two propositions 
must be established. The promise of marriage must have 
been a false promise, given in bad faith and with no 
intention of being adhered to at the time it was given. The 
false promise itself must be of immediate relevance, or bear 
a direct nexus to the woman's decision to engage in the 
sexual act.” 
 
 
 
23. We, accordingly allow the appeal and set-aside the impugned 
judgment and order of the High Court dated 16.10.2023 in 
application under Section 482 CrPC. The application under Section 
482 of CrPC shall accordingly stand allowed. The FIR No.272 of 
2019 dated 29.09.2019 registered with Police Station South Rohini, 
Delhi under Sections 376(2)(n) and 506 of the IPC, charge-sheet

dated 22.11.2019 filed in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, 
Rohini, Delhi and the trial pending in the Court of ASJ, Rohini, 
Delhi shall accordingly stand quashed.
