Code of Civil Procedure, 19081 challenging the order of 
the Executing Court dated 03.05.2007 rejecting the 
objections under Section 47 CPC, has been allowed. The 
order impugned therein passed by the Executing Court 
was set aside and it was held that the decree dated 
09.05.1979 passed by the Trial Court in Suit No.13/72 
was inexecutable and a nullity and accordingly, the 
objections under Section 47 CPC, were allowed. 
3. The factual matrix giving rise to the present appeal is 
as follows: 
3.1. The dispute relates to property being Municipal Nos.52-
57, Maniharon Ka Rasta, Jaipur which was originally 
owned by Ghulam Mohiuddin (Defendant No.1).  An 
agreement to Sell dated 04.10.1967 was executed for 
sale of the suit property by Saeeduddin – Defendant 
No.2 (brother of Defendant No.1) and also the power of 
 
1 CPC

Page 3 of 22 
 
attorney of Defendant No.1, for himself and for the 
principal Defendant No.1. 
3.2. Pursuant to the aforesaid agreement to sell, as the 
vendor was not executing the sale deed, the appellant 
(plaintiff) instituted a Civil Suit for specific performance 
registered as Suit No.13/72 impleading Ghulam 
Mohiuddin as Defendant no.1 and Saeeduddin as 
Defendant No.2.  During the pendency of the Suit, the 
parties entered into a compromise dated 11.05.1978 
and presented the same before the Trial Court, a copy 
of which is filed as Annexure P-4.  The terms of the 
Compromise Deed are briefly set out below:

Most respectfully showeth: 
 
In the above civil suit, a compromise has been arrived at 
between the parties on under mentioned conditions, 
therefore, the suit may be decreed as per the compromise. 
 
1.  
That, plaintiff and defendant No.3 executed an 
agreement for sale with the real brother and 
general power of attorney of Def. No.2 named 
Saiduddin Khan on 4.10.1967 in writing in 
respect to houses and shops No. 52 to 57, 
situated at Circle No.1, Chaukadi Modikhana, 
Jaipur, whose full description is given under, for 
a sale consideration of Rs.40,000/- in his own 
capacity and in the capacity of general power of 
attorney of Def. No.l, which was not accepted 
earlier by the defendant No.1 and 2, but now the 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 5 of 22 
 
Def. No.1 admits that agreement for sale was 
executed on 4.10.1967 on behalf of Def. No.2 in 
his own capacity and on behalf and consent of 
Def. No.1. 
 
2. 
That, Def. No.l also admits that a sum of Rs. 
10,000/- out of entire agreed sale consideration 
was received in respect to the disputed property 
on 4.10.1967 and a sum of Rs.1,000/- was 
received on 1.1.69 and Rs.500/- on 22.1.69 i.e. a 
total of Rs.11,500/- was received by def. No. 2 on 
behalf of Def No. 1 which is liable to be adjusted 
from the total consideration of the property, but 
the plaintiff and defendant No.3 have alleged to 
spent Rs.6,500/- in the repairing of house etc, 
which amount shall not be adjusted from the sale 
consideration because all these repairing and 
construction was done after the above agreement 
by the plaintiff and Def. No.3. besides this, the 
Def. No.1 has received Rs. 1500/- on 17.10.88, 
and Rs.1000/- on 24.10.77 and Rs.1000/- on 
11.11.77 from the plaintiff towards the cost of this 
property. 
 
3. 
That, the Def. No.1 shall get executed and 
registered sale-deed of the above described 
houses and shops in favor of plaintiff Rehan 
Ahmad till 1.7.1978 and shall receive remaining 
sale consideration amount of Rs.25,000/ -. If the 
Def. No. 1 fails to execute sale deed in this period 
then the plaintiff Rehan Ahmad shall be entitled 
to get the sale-deed executed and registered in his 
favor through the Court. Entire cost of registry 
would be borne equally by the plaintiff Rehan 
Ahmad and Def. No.1 Gulam Mohiuddin. In this 
respect when the Def. No.1 will ask for half cost 
for this from the plaintiff Rehan Ahmed then the 
plaintiff Rehan Ahmad shall pay the same taking 
receipt from him and because of this the Def. No.1 
shall not be entitled to get the period agreed for 
registry extended. The def. No.1 has received 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 6 of 22 
 
today the half cost of registry i.e. Rs.1,000/- from 
the 
plaintiff 
Rehan 
Ahmad. 
Complete 
responsibility to receive N.O.C. shall be of the Def. 
No.l. 
 
4. 
That, Def. No.2 is residing in the third floor of 
disputed property which would be got vacated by 
defendant No.1 and the physical possession will 
be given to the plaintiff Rehan Ahmed prior to 
registration, and shall get the rent notes executed 
by the tenants who are presently occupying the 
disputed property in favour of Rehan Ahmed. 
 
5. 
That, pro forma defendant No.3 has relinquished 
his entire right in respect to the disputed property 
in favor of plaintiff Rehan Ahmad on 28.6.1977 
through a deed of Relinquishment, which was. 
ordered by the court on 28.09.1977. Therefore, 
pro 
forma 
defendant 
no.3 
shall 
have 
no 
connection now with this sale. 
 
6.  
That, the. def. No.2 Saiduddin Khan, himself has 
admitted that he did not have right to sell or to 
execute agreement for sale of the disputed 
property, but now, the defendant No.1, who is the 
real owner of this disputed property, admits this 
agreement, therefore, now there is no hindrance 
in passing decree. 
 
7.  
That, cost of this suit shall be borne by the parties 
respectively.

4. In paragraph No.1 of the Compromise Deed, it is 
mentioned that Defendant No.1, although had earlier 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 8 of 22 
 
not accepted the Agreement to Sell, now admits that the 
Agreement to Sell dated 04.10.1967 was executed by 
Saeeduddin–Defendant No.2, not only in his own 
capacity but also on behalf of Defendant No.1 as Power 
of Attorney holder. Paragraph No.2 mentions the details 
of the amount received by the Defendant under the 
Agreement to Sell as advance until the time the 
compromise was arrived at.  It would be relevant to 
mention that the total sale consideration was 
Rs.40,000/- out of which as per paragraph No.2 of the 
Compromise Deed, Rs.15,000/- had already been 
received by the Defendants.  Paragraph No.3 mentions 
that the Defendant No.1 will get the Sale Deed executed 
and registered in favour of the Plaintiff till 01.07.1978 
after receiving Rs.25,000/- of the remaining sale 
consideration. It, however, mentioned that if the 
Defendant No.1 does not execute the Sale Deed till 
01.07.1978, the Plaintiff would be entitled to get the 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 9 of 22 
 
Sale Deed executed and registered in his favour through 
the Court.  The cost of registration would be borne 
equally by the Plaintiff and Defendant No.1. It was 
further mentioned that Defendant No.1 had also 
received half of the cost of registration from the Plaintiff 
and furthermore, the responsibility to receive the NOC 
would be of Defendant No.1. Paragraph No.4 mentions 
that Saeeduddin–Defendant No.2 was residing on the 
third floor of the suit property which Defendant No.1-
Ghulam Mohiuddin would get vacated and ensure that 
physical possession is delivered to the Plaintiff-Rehan 
Ahmed prior to registration.  Further, the rent notes 
executed by the tenants who are presently occupying 
the suit property, would be executed by the tenants in 
favour of Rehan Ahmed.  One Ahsan Ahmed has been 
impleaded as proforma defendant in respect of whom it 
was stated in paragraph No.5 of the Compromise Deed 
that he had relinquished his entire right to the property 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 10 of 22 
 
in favour of the Plaintiff–Rehan Ahmed through a Deed 
of Relinquishment dated 28.06.1977 which was 
accepted by the Court vide order dated 28.09.1977.  In 
paragraph No.6 it was stated that Defendant No.2-
Saeeduddin admitted that he did not have the right to 
sell or execute the Agreement to Sell but now Defendant 
No.1, who was the real owner of the suit property, 
admits this agreement. Therefore, there is no hindrance 
in passing the compromise decree.  The property was 
also described in the Compromise Deed to be a pacca 
house comprising of three stories and one chauk 
including the entire internal houses of the three storeys 
and five shops outside along with the staircase 
adjoining the shops.  The house was numbered as 54/1 
in the municipal records, whereas the five shops were 
numbered as 52, 53, 55, 56 and 57.  Thus the entire 
property in question including the house of the five 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 11 of 22 
 
shops having municipal numbers 52 to 57 (except 54), 
Circle No.1.   
5. The Addl.District & Sessions Judge, Court No.1, Jaipur 
City, Jaipur proceeded with the compromise and 
required the same to be duly verified for which due time 
was granted to the parties.  On 09.05.1979, initially the 
suit was dismissed in the absence of the Plaintiff.  
However, on the same date, upon an application being 
filed, the case was again taken up on board.  The Trial 
Court recorded that Rehan Ahmed and that Mohiuddin 
(Defendant No.1) had executed the compromise.  The 
Plaintiff (Rehan Ahmed) further stated that he does not 
want to pursue any proceedings against Saeeduddin 
and also Ahsan Ahmed-Defendant Nos.2 and 3, as such 
the suit was dismissed against Saeeduddin and Ahsan 
Ahmed.  It was decreed against Ghulam Mohiuddin as 
per the compromise. Accordingly, a decree was drawn.  
As per the decree, when the defendant did not execute 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 12 of 22 
 
the Sale Deed, the Plaintiff -Decree holder initiated the 
proceedings for execution. In the execution proceedings 
Defendant No.1 Ghulam Mohiuddin filed objections 
stating that the Plaintiff had not paid the balance sale 
consideration, and had allowed substantial time to pass 
for about six to seven years, during which time the 
value of the property had doubled and as such the 
decree could not be executed now on account of the 
default of the Plaintiff-Decree holder. These objections 
were dismissed by the Executing Court by a detailed 
order dated 09.12.1998 on the findings that before the 
registration of the Sale Deed, Defendant No.1 was 
required to fulfil his obligations which included getting 
the third floor vacated, getting the NOC and also getting 
the rent deeds transferred in the name of the Plaintiff.  
As such there was no default on the part of the Plaintiff. 
In the meantime, the Defendant No.1 Mohiuddin died.  
The order dated 09.12.1998 was challenged by one 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 13 of 22 
 
General Tariq, s/o. Defendant No.2- Saeeduddin and 
legal heir of Defendant No.1 Gulam Mohiuddin, 
claiming rights under a sale executed by Defendant 
No.1 Mohiuddin by way of S.B.Civil Revision Petition 
No.55 of 1999.  The said revision came to be dismissed 
by the High Court vide order dated 02.06.2006. General 
Tariq preferred a Special Leave Petition before this 
Court registered as S.L.P.(C) No.12463 of 2006, which 
came to be dismissed by this Court vide order dated 
11.08.2006. With the dismissal of the Special Leave 
Petition the innings of the objections under Section 47 
CPC filed by the Judgment-debtor – Defendant No.1 
Mohiuddin came to an end. General Tariq, s/o. 
Defendant no.2- Saeeduddin did not carry the matter 
any further by way of review or otherwise before this 
court.  However, a new round of objections under 
Section 47 CPC came to be initiated by respondent no.1 
– Akhtar Un Nisa, wife of Defendant No.2-Saeeduddin 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 14 of 22 
 
and the mother of General Tariq.  The objections by 
respondent No.1 Akhtar Un Nisa are to the following 
effect: 
I. 
The decree dated 09.05.1979 is without 
jurisdiction and a nullity; 
II. 
The property in the suit was a joint property of 
Ghulam 
Mohiuddin 
and 
Saeeduddin– 
Defendants No. 1 and 2 respectively; 
III. 
The suit having been filed as against both the 
brothers, the compromise deed could not have 
been arrived at between the Plaintiff and 
Defendant No.1 alone; 
IV. 
The Trial Court could not have accepted the 
settlement/compromise between the Plaintiff 
and Defendant No.1 regarding Defendant No.2 
vacating the third story of the house in question 
and the rent notes being transferred in favour 
of the plaintiff.  

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 15 of 22 
 
V. 
Since there was no decree against Saeeduddin, 
as such Decree holder could not have any right 
of getting possession of the portion of the 
property which was admittedly in possession of 
Saeeduddin and owner.  Further, the tenants of 
Saeeduddin in the disputed property were 
tenants of the applicant-objector Akhtar Un 
Nisa-respondent no.1. 
6. The Executing Court, vide judgment and order dated 
03.05.2007, dismissed the objections under Section 47 
CPC filed by Smt.Akhtar Un Nisa.   
7. Aggrieved by the same, Smt.Akhtar Un Nisa preferred a 
revision before the High Court which has since been 
allowed by the impugned order giving rise to the present 
appeal.  
8. After careful consideration of the arguments presented 
by both sides, this Court believes that the High Court 
erred in setting aside the Executing Court's order dated 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 16 of 22 
 
09.12.1998 and in declaring the Trial Court's decree 
dated 09.05.1979 void. The High Court's decision 
appears to be based on several incorrect assumptions 
and observations. 
9. The core of the High Court's reasoning rests on the 
erroneous assumption that the property was jointly 
owned by Defendants No. 1 and No. 2, and that the 
absence of Defendant No. 2's signature on the 
compromise dated 11.05.1978 invalidated the decree. 
However, 
Defendant 
No. 
2 
has 
consistently 
acknowledged that he had no ownership rights over the 
property. In his written statement to the Trial Court in 
Suit No. 13/72, he explicitly stated that the property 
belonged solely to Defendant No. 1. This was further 
supported by a family arrangement dated 17.09.1976 
and reinforced in Paragraph 6 of the compromise deed. 
The compromise, signed by Defendant No. 1 and the 
plaintiff and later verified by Defendant No. 2 through 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 17 of 22 
 
an application dated 14.05.1979, substantiates that 
Defendant No. 1 was the sole owner. These facts were 
upheld by the High Court and this Court in previous 
proceedings. During the challenge to the execution 
proceedings filed by General Tarik before the High 
Court, the High Court vide order dated 11.8.2006 had 
also recorded the finding that Defendant no.2 did not 
have ownership rights over the suit property which fact 
was also upheld by this Court. Defendant no. 2 had 
limited rights of being in possession of the third floor of 
suit property. Due to the aforesaid reasons, the Plaintiff 
and Defendant no. 1 were the only necessary parties 
needed for the compromise dated 11.05.1978 as 
Defendant no.1 was the sole owner of the suit property.  
10. The High Court also incorrectly held that the provisions 
of Order XXIII, Rule 3 of the CPC were not adhered to, 
claiming that the Trial Court failed to properly verify the 
compromise. It is essential to clarify that the 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 18 of 22 
 
compromise was indeed reached on 11.05.1978, with 
its verification delayed due to various adjournments 
caused by the absence or illness of Defendant No.1 and 
other procedural delays. On 09.05.1979, a fresh 
compromise application containing identical terms was 
submitted and duly signed by both parties due to the 
original being misplaced. The Trial Court then correctly 
recorded and verified this compromise, fulfilling the 
requirements of Order XXIII, Rule 3 of the CPC. 
11. It must be made clear that the compromise between the 
Plaintiff and Defendant no. 1 was arrived on 11.05.1978 
and it was only the procedural requirements of Order 
XXIII Rule 3 of verifying and the compromise before the 
Court which were eventually completed on 09.05.1979. 
A perusal of the record of proceedings before the Trial 
Court reveals that verification of the terms of the 
compromise was attempted on 11.05.1978 but was not 
possible as Defendant No.1 was not present. Moreover, 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 19 of 22 
 
on subsequent dates being 11.5.1978, 24.07.1978, 
31.01.1979 and 20.03.1979, either due to the illness of 
Defendant no.1 or due to the Presiding Officer not being 
present, there were various adjournments before the 
Trial Court. Finally, on 09.05.1979, Gulam Mohiuddin 
appeared before the Court and the parties submitted a 
fresh compromise application was filed because the 
earlier compromise application submitted on 11-05-
1978 was not traceable on the record of the Court 
containing the same terms and conditions as in the 
compromise application earlier filed on 11.05.1978. The 
said application was also duly signed by both the 
parties. On the basis of the said compromise presented 
on 09.05.1979, the Trial Court took the compromise 
application on record, verified the fresh compromise 
application fulfilling all the terms and conditions of 
Order XXIII Rule 3 CPC. The terms and conditions of 
the compromise were read over to the parties and were 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 20 of 22 
 
accepted by them and the signatures of the parities 
were taken on the compromise application by the Court 
and thereafter the Court recorded its satisfaction on the 
compromise application, which is on the record of the 
Trial Court. The decree dated 09.05.1979 was passed 
based on this compromise. 
12. As far as the terms of the compromise are concerned, 
which have also been questioned by the High Court, the 
agreement stipulated that Defendant No. 1 was to 
execute and register the sale deed in favor of the 
plaintiff by 01.07.1978, after receiving  balance 
payment of Rs 25,000/-. The decree's execution was 
contingent upon Defendant No. 1 fulfilling conditions 
such as obtaining the NOC and ensuring Defendant No. 
2 vacating the portion of the property in question in his 
possession. The recording of the compromise and the 
consequent decree on 09.05.1979, although appearing 

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 21 of 22 
 
procedurally delayed, adhered to the process required 
under CPC. 
13. Furthermore, the High Court overlooked the fact that 
General Tarik, legal heir of Defendant No. 2, had 
previously objected to the execution proceedings, which 
was dismissed on 09.12.1988. Subsequent appeals 
before the High Court, including a Special Leave 
Petition to this Court, were also dismissed. Therefore, 
similar objections by Respondent No. 1, Smt. Akhtar Un 
Nisa, in her capacity as one of the legal heirs of 
Defendant No. 2 would not be maintainable and would 
amount to abuse of process of law.  
14. In light of the reasons recorded above, this Court finds 
merit in the appellant-plaintiff’s argument and holds 
that the Executing Court had rightly rejected the 
objections under Section 47 CPC filed by Smt.Akhtar 
Un Nisa vide order 03.05.2007.  

SLP(CIVIL) NO. 18772 OF 2014 
 
Page 22 of 22 
 
15. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The impugned 
judgement of the High Court is set aside, and the 
Executing Court's order dated 03.05.2007 is restored 
and the objections of Respondent no.1 under Section 47 
of the CPC stand rejected. 
16. There shall, however, be no order as to costs.
