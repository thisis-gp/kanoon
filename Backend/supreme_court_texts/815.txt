9. Upon certain other issues arising between the parties, the petitioner tendered

Resolution dated 18.07.2013.  

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 9 of 31 
 
 
10. The petitioner was concerned with the failure of respondent no.2 in 
transferring 2,00,010 shares in respondent no.1 which belonged to the 
petitioner despite confirmation of the same vide letter dated 22.09.2011 and 
also the non-issuance of the share certificates evidencing allotment of 
additional 2,00,010 shares in the name of the petitioner by respondent no. 1. 
The petitioner further contended that despite holding 4,00,000 equity shares 
in respondent no.1 as per the Shareholders Agreement, respondent no.1 failed 
to issue duly stamped, signed and sealed share certificates evidencing such 
an allotment to the petitioner.  
 
 
11. It is the case of the petitioner that he had requested respondent no.1 on several 
occasions to either issue the share certificates evidencing allotment of 
4,00,000 equity shares or in the alternate, return the amount equivalent to 
such shares. The petitioner alleged that, since the share certificates were not 
issued to him, he was unable to send an ‘offer notice’ to sell his portion of 
equity shares to respondent no.2 who has the “Right of First Refusal” under 
Clause 6 of the Shareholders Agreement. 
 
 
12.  The petitioner stated that since the respondents were not paying heed to his 
repeated requests for issuance of share certificates, the petitioner sent a 
Common Notice dated 23.01.2017 (hereinafter referred to as “Arbitration 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 10 of 31 
 
Notice”) to both the respondents, directing them to either issue the share 
certificates evidencing allotment of 2,00,010 and 4,00,000 shares 
respectively or in the alternate, to return the amount equivalent to those 
shares. The same was received by both the respondents on 24.01.2017. In the 
event of a dispute, the Arbitration Notice called upon the respondents to 
appoint arbitrators in terms of Clause 13.10 of the Shareholders Agreement. 
The said clause is reproduced hereinbelow:  
 
“13.10. Dispute Resolution. Any dispute, claim or 
controversy arising under or relating to this Agreement, 
including without limitation any dispute concerning the 
existence or enforceability hereof, shall be resolved by 
arbitration in Mumbai in accordance with the Arbitration 
and Conciliation Act, 1996. The dispute will be referred to 
the arbitrator, and Gumpro has right to appoint 2 (two) 
arbitrators and Other Shareholder have the right to appoint 
1(one) arbitrator. All these three (03) arbitrators, will 
appoint one of them to act as umpire of the arbitral tribunal. 
The language of the arbitration shall be English. Any 
arbitration award by the arbitral tribunal shall be final and 
binding upon the Parties, shall not be subject to appeal, and 
shall be enforced by judgment of a court of competent 
jurisdiction.” 
 
 
13. As there was no response from the respondents, the petitioner filed two 
separate applications dated 03.03.2017 under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996, 
bearing Arbitration Application No. 50 of 2017 for adjudication of disputes 
pertaining to the 4,00,000 equity shares and Arbitration Application No. 51 
of 2017 for adjudication of disputes pertaining to 2,00,010 equity shares, 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 11 of 31 
 
before the High Court of Bombay, praying for the appointment of an arbitral 
tribunal.   
 
14. After nearly 10 months from the date of the arbitration notice, on 07.11.2017, 
the respondents sent a reply denying and disputing all the claims and 
allegations made by the petitioner. Without prejudice to the contentions in 
the reply, the respondents appointed two arbitrators in terms of clause 13.10 
of the Shareholders Agreement and called upon the petitioner to nominate 
the third arbitrator. It was asserted that the alleged claim of 2,00,010 shares 
or the value thereof cannot be referred to arbitration as it does not fall within 
the remit of the dispute resolution clause of the Shareholders Agreement.  
 
 
15.  The High Court of Bombay vide Judgment and final order dated 22.02.2019 
held that the petitioner is a Non-Resident Indian who habitually resides and 
works in Dubai. The proceedings would constitute an “international 
commercial arbitration” and therefore, the Section 11 applications filed 
before it were not maintainable.  
 
 
16. In light of the above and upon the dismissal of the Section 11 applications by 
the High Court, the petitioner has filed the present petitions before this Court 
i.e., Arbitration Petition No.20 and Arbitration Petition No. 22 under Section 
11(6), for appointment of an arbitral tribunal, to adjudicate the disputes under 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 12 of 31 
 
the Shareholders Agreement pertaining to 2,00,010 shares and 4,00,000 
shares respectively.  
 
 
II. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER  
 
 
17.  Mr. Kunal Cheema, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, 
submitted that both the arbitration petitions arise out of disputes under the 
Shareholders Agreement. Clause 13.10 of the agreement provides for the 
arbitration clause and the same has not been disputed by the parties.  
 
18. It was submitted that the petitioner was entitled to be allotted 4,00,000 equity 
shares of Rs. 10 each in respondent no.1 company under the Shareholders 
Agreement. In addition, as per the letter dated 22.09.2011, respondent no.2 
further confirmed that 2,00,010 equity shares in respondent no.1 which 
belonged to the petitioner, were being held by respondent no.2. Despite 
repeated reminders to both the respondents, the share certificates of the 
aforementioned shares were not issued to the petitioner.  
 
 
19. The counsel submitted that the respondents have raised two broad 
contentions - one, with respect to the merits of the dispute; and two, that the 
claims made in the petitions are not maintainable as they are barred by 
limitation. As regards the first aspect, it was submitted that the merits of the 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 13 of 31 
 
dispute can be looked into by the arbitral tribunal and arguments on merit 
can be made after the parties file their pleadings and lead evidence therein.  
 
 
20. On the issue of limitation, it was submitted that under the Shareholders 
Agreement, there was no time frame within which the share certificates were 
to be issued to the petitioner. On a reading of the letter dated 22.09.2011, the 
value of the share was to be paid to the petitioner at the time of sale of  
respondent no.1 company. As far as the petitioner is aware, such a sale has 
not been made, at least till the issuance of notice dated 23.02.2017. Hence, 
there is no specific date/day on which it can be ascertained that the cause of 
action had arisen.  
 
 
21. The counsel submitted that it is the case of the respondents that certain 
correspondence was exchanged between the parties in the period between 
06.08.2015 and 15.10.2015. Therefore, the Arbitration Notice dated 
23.01.2017 was sent within 3 years from 15.10.2015 which is the date of the 
last legal notice sent by the respondents to the petitioner. Thereafter, the 
petitioner filed two arbitration applications on 03.03.2017 before the High 
Court of Bombay which were ultimately dismissed on 22.02.2019. 
Immediately thereafter, on 09.04.2019, the present petitions were filed before 
this Court. Therefore, the arbitration petitions cannot be said to be ex-facie 
time barred and the implication or interpretation of the said correspondences 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 14 of 31 
 
could be looked into by the arbitral tribunal while deciding the claim and its 
maintainability on the question of limitation and merits. 
 
 
22. It was submitted that, without prejudice to the aforesaid contention, even if 
it is assumed that the “cause of action” had arisen at any specific point of 
time, there is a continuing breach of contract since the respondents failed to  
provide the share certificates and abide by the Shareholders Agreement and 
the letter dated 22.09.2011. Therefore, in view of Section 22 of the Limitation 
Act, 1963, a fresh period of limitation would begin to run at every moment 
of time during which the breach continues.  
 
 
23.  Another submission of the counsel was that the respondents, on 07.11.2017 
had sent a reply to the Arbitration Notice dated 23.01.2017 wherein they 
appointed two arbitrators as per Clause 13.10 of the Shareholders Agreement. 
The same was sent after the applications under Section 11(6) were filed 
before the High Court of Bombay. In the said letter, the respondents have not 
contended that the claim is time barred.  
 
 
24. It was further submitted that, in reply to the Arbitration Notice, the only case 
of the respondents is that the issue regarding the 2,00,010 shares cannot be 
referred to arbitration under clause 13.10 of the Shareholders Agreement and 
that the scope of arbitration should be confined only to the issue of the 
4,00,000 shares. However, the letter dated 22.09.2011 clearly states that the 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 15 of 31 
 
2,00,010 shares will be governed by the Shareholders Agreement. Therefore, 
this being a contentious issue should be considered by the arbitral tribunal.  
 
 
25. The counsel finally submitted that, in the event the Court is inclined to allow 
the petition, then, considering the nature and low value of the claim, instead 
of a three-member tribunal, a sole arbitrator may be appointed.  
 
 
III. 
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 
26. On the other hand, Ms. Jasmine Damkewala, the learned counsel appearing 
for the respondents submitted that the petitioner is seeking implementation 
of the Shareholders Agreement dated 25.07.2011. However, the petitioner 
has violated the Lock-in Period of 3 years, in as much as the petitioner’s date 
of employment is 01.01.2011 and the date of acceptance of resignation vide 
the board resolution is 18.07.2013.  
 
27. It was submitted that in terms of Clause 4 of the Shareholders Agreement, 
the petitioner was holding 4,00,000 equity shares in respondent no.1. Clause 
5.1 of the said Shareholders Agreement specifically indicates that the 
petitioner shall not transfer any part of his individual shareholding until the 
expiry of 3 years from the date of issue of such shares. It was argued that 
there was a clear understanding which was agreed upon by the parties that 
the shares of the petitioner shall remain locked for a period of 3 years from 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 16 of 31 
 
the date of their issuance or conversion of it into equity shares. However, any 
right over the said shares would accrue only if the petitioner remained in 
employment.  
 
 
28. Clause 3 of the Service Agreement indicates that the Director shall hold 
office for a period of 3 years commencing from the date of employment 
(w.e.f. 01.01.2011) which is a Lock-in Period. Further Clause 10.2 of the 
Service Agreement states that the petitioner shall transfer all the equity shares 
held by him in favour of the Promoter of respondent no.1 at zero 
consideration if he terminates his employment prior to the Initial Term of 3 
years. Accordingly, the petitioner would in any case, have no valid right or 
claim over the subject shares having terminated his employment before a 
period of 3 years.  
 
29. It was submitted that as per Recital 3, and Clauses 3.1 and 4.1 respectively 
of the Commercial Expertise Agreement, for the petitioner to hold the shares, 
he ought to have worked for a period of 3 years. Since the petitioner resigned 
on 18.07.2013, he is not entitled to these shares. In any case, any claim 
regarding the 4,00,000 equity shares, howsoever misconceived, can arise 
only upon the date of resignation i.e., 18.07.2013 and the Arbitration Notice 
being issued on 23.01.2017 was clearly outside of limitation. Therefore, the 
present petition is stale, belated and misconceived.

30. The counsel, in the last, submitted that Section 43 of the Act, 1996 lays down 
that the Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable to arbitrations. An arbitration 
commences upon issuing the notice of invocation of arbitration in accordance 
with the arbitral clause i.e., Clause 13.10 of the Shareholders Agreement. 
Accordingly, where the petitioner seeks enforcement of the letter dated 
22.09.2011, the Notice for Invocation of Arbitration was served 6 years later 
i.e., on 23.01.2017 and is hopelessly outside of limitation. For the sake of 
argument and without admitting, even if limitation for the claim of the 
petitioner with respect to the 2,00,010 shares is calculated from the date when 
he ceased to be in employment, i.e., from 18.07.2013, the claim is still clearly 
time-barred.

IV. 
ANALYSIS 
 
31. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone 
through the materials on record, the short question that falls for our 
consideration is whether we should decline to make a reference under Section 
11(6) of the Act, 1996 by examining whether the substantive claims of the 
petitioner are ex facie and hopelessly time barred?    
 
32.  A three-judge bench of this Court in Vidya Drolia & Ors v. Durga Trading 
Corporation reported in (2021) 2 SCC 1 while dealing with the scope of 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 18 of 31 
 
powers of the referral court under Sections 8 and 11 respectively, endorsed 
the prima facie test and opined that Courts at the referral stage can interfere 
only in rare cases where it is manifest that the claims are ex facie time-barred 
and dead, or there is no subsisting dispute. Such a restricted and limited 
review was considered necessary to check and protect parties from being 
forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably “non-arbitrable” and to 
cut off the deadwood. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:  
 
“148. Section 43(1) of the Arbitration Act states that the 
Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies 
to court proceedings. Sub-section (2) states that for the 
purposes of the Arbitration Act and Limitation Act, 
arbitration shall be deemed to have commenced on the date 
referred to in Section 21. Limitation law is procedural and 
normally disputes, being factual, would be for the arbitrator 
to decide guided by the facts found and the law applicable. 
The court at the referral stage can interfere only when it is 
manifest that the claims are ex facie time-barred and dead, 
or there is no subsisting dispute. All other cases should be 
referred to the Arbitral Tribunal for decision on merits. 
Similar would be the position in case of disputed “no-claim 
certificate” or defence on the plea of novation and “accord 
and satisfaction”. As observed in Premium Nafta Products 
Ltd. [Fili Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Premium Nafta Products Ltd., 
2007 UKHL 40 : 2007 Bus LR 1719 (HL)] , it is not to be 
expected that commercial men while entering transactions 
inter se would knowingly create a system which would 
require that the court should first decide whether the contract 
should be rectified or avoided or rescinded, as the case may 
be, and then if the contract is held to be valid, it would 
require the arbitrator to resolve the issues that have arisen.

154.4. Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere at 
Section 8 or 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex facie 
certain that the arbitration agreement is non-existent, invalid 
or the disputes are non-arbitrable, though the nature and 
facet of non-arbitrability would, to some extent, determine 
the level and nature of judicial scrutiny. The restricted and 
limited review is to check and protect parties from being 
forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably “non-
arbitrable” and to cut off the deadwood. The court by default 
would refer the matter when contentions relating to non-
arbitrability are plainly arguable; when consideration in 
summary 
proceedings 
would 
be 
insufficient 
and 
inconclusive; when facts are contested; when the party 
opposing arbitration adopts delaying tactics or impairs 
conduct of arbitration proceedings. This is not the stage for 
the court to enter into a mini trial or elaborate review so as 
to usurp the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal but to affirm 
and uphold integrity and efficacy of arbitration as an 
alternative dispute resolution mechanism.”

33. In Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Another v. Nortel Networks India 
Private Limited reported in (2021) 5 SCC 738, the notice invoking 
arbitration was issued 5 ½ years after the cause of action arose, i.e., rejection 
of the claims of Nortel by BSNL and the claim was therefore held to be ex 
facie time-barred. This Court clarified that the period of limitation for filing 
a petition seeking appointment of an arbitrator(s) cannot be confused or 
conflated with the period of limitation applicable to substantive claims made 
in the underlying commercial contract. By placing reliance on Vidya Drolia 
(supra)  it was held that, a referral court exercising its jurisdiction under 
section 11 may decline to make the reference in a very limited category of 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 20 of 31 
 
cases, where there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is ex facie 
time-barred. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:  
 
 
“44. The 
issue 
of 
limitation 
which 
concerns 
the 
“admissibility” of the claim, must be decided by the Arbitral 
Tribunal either as a preliminary issue, or at the final stage 
after evidence is led by the parties. 
 
   xxx  
 
 
 
xxx 
 
 
 
xxx 
 
47. It is only in the very limited category of cases, where 
there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is ex facie 
time-barred, or that the dispute is non-arbitrable, that the 
court may decline to make the reference. However, if there is 
even the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the disputes to 
arbitration, otherwise it would encroach upon what is 
essentially a matter to be determined by the tribunal. 
 
48. Applying the law to the facts of the present case, it is clear 
that this is a case where the claims are ex facie time-barred 
by over 5½ years, since Nortel did not take any action 
whatsoever after the rejection of its claim by BSNL on 4-8-
2014. The notice of arbitration was invoked on 29-4-2020. 
There is not even an averment either in the notice of 
arbitration, or the petition filed under Section 11, or before 
this Court, of any intervening facts which may have 
occurred, which would extend the period of limitation falling 
within Sections 5 to 20 of the Limitation Act. Unless, there is 
a pleaded case specifically adverting to the applicable 
section, and how it extends the limitation from the date on 
which the cause of action originally arose, there can be no 
basis to save the time of limitation. 
 
49. The present case is a case of deadwood/no subsisting 
dispute since the cause of action arose on 4-8-2014, when the 
claims made by Nortel were rejected by BSNL. The 
respondent has not stated any event which would extend the 
period of limitation, which commenced as per Article 55 of 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 21 of 31 
 
the Schedule of the Limitation Act (which provides the 
limitation for cases pertaining to breach of contract) 
immediately after the rejection of the final bill by making 
deductions.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
34. This very Bench in Arif Azim Company Limited v. Aptech Limited reported 
in (2024) 5 SCC 313 was concerned with the following two issues while 
deciding an application for the appointment of an arbitrator under Section 
11(6) of the Act, 1996 – first, whether the Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable 
to an application for appointment of arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act, 
1996?; and second, whether the Court may decline to make a reference under 
Section 11 of the Act, 1996 where the claims are ex-facie and hopelessly time 
barred.  
 
35. On the first issue in Arif Azim (supra), it was observed that Section 11(6) of 
the Act, 1996 would be covered by Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 
which prescribes a limitation period of 3 years from the date when the right 
to apply accrues. The limitation period for filing an application seeking 
appointment of an arbitrator was held to commence only after a valid notice 
invoking arbitration had been issued by one of the parties to the other party 
and there had been either a failure or refusal on the part of the other party to 
comply with the requirements of the said notice.  
 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 22 of 31 
 
36.  On the second issue in Arif Azim (supra), which is identical to the issue 
raised in the present petitions, it was observed that, although, limitation is an 
admissibility issue, yet it is the duty of the Courts to prima facie examine and 
reject non-arbitrable or dead claims, so as to protect the other party from 
being drawn into a time-consuming and costly arbitration process. The 
findings on both the issues were summarized as thus:  
 
“92. Thus, from an exhaustive analysis of the position of law 
on the issues, we are of the view that while considering the 
issue of limitation in relation to a petition under Section 
11(6) of the 1996 Act, the Courts should satisfy themselves 
on two aspects by employing a two-pronged test — first, 
whether the petition under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act is 
barred by limitation; and secondly, whether the claims 
sought to be arbitrated are ex facie dead claims and are thus 
barred by limitation on the date of commencement of 
arbitration proceedings. If either of these issues are 
answered against the party seeking referral of disputes to 
arbitration, the Court may refuse to appoint an Arbitral 
Tribunal.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
37. However, subsequently, very pertinent observations were made by a seven-
judge Bench of this Court in Interplay between Arbitration Agreements 
Under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and the Indian Stamp 
Act, 1899, In Re, reported in 2023 INSC 1066 regarding the scope of judicial 
interference at the Section 11 stage with a view to give complete meaning to 
the legislative intention behind the insertion of Section 11(6-A) of the Act, 
1996. This Court referred to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 23 of 31 
 
2015 Amendment Act and opined that the same indicated that the referral 
courts shall “examine the existence of a prima facie arbitration agreement 
and not other issues” at the stage of appointment of an arbitrator. These 
“other issues” would include the examination of any other issue which has 
the consequence of unnecessary judicial interference in the arbitral 
proceedings. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:  
 
“208. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 2015 
Amendment Act are as follows:  
 
“(iii) an application for appointment of an arbitrator shall 
be disposed of by the High Court or Supreme Court, as the 
case may be, as expeditiously as possible and an 
endeavour should be made to dispose of the matter within 
a period of sixty days.  
 
(iv) to provide that while considering any application for 
appointment of arbitrator, the High Court or the Supreme 
Court shall examine the existence of a prima facie 
arbitration agreement and not other issues.” 
 
 
209. The above extract indicates that the Supreme Court or 
High Court at the stage of the appointment of an arbitrator 
shall “examine the existence of a prima facie arbitration 
agreement and not other issues”. These other issues not only 
pertain to the validity of the arbitration agreement, but also 
include any other issues which are a consequence of 
unnecessary judicial interference in the arbitration 
proceedings. Accordingly, the “other issues” also include 
examination and impounding of an unstamped instrument by 
the referral court at the Section 8 or Section 11 stage […]” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 24 of 31 
 
38.  In light of the aforesaid observations, the ratio of Arif Azim (supra) was 
reconsidered by this very Bench in SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Krish 
Spinning reported in 2024 SCC OnLine SC 1754. The position of law was 
clarified as thus: 
 
“128. On the first issue, it was observed by us that 
the Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable to the applications 
filed under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996. Further, we also 
held that it is the duty of the referral court to examine that 
the application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 is not 
barred by period of limitation as prescribed under Article 
137 of the Limitation Act, 1963, i.e., 3 years from the date 
when the right to apply accrues in favour of the applicant. To 
determine as to when the right to apply would accrue, we had 
observed in paragraph 56 of the said decision that “the 
limitation period for filing a petition under Section 11(6) of 
the Act, 1996 can only commence once a valid notice 
invoking arbitration has been sent by the applicant to the 
other party, and there has been a failure or refusal on part of 
that other party in complying with the requirements 
mentioned in such notice.” 
 
129. Insofar as the first issue is concerned, we are of the 
opinion that the observations made by us in Arif 
Azim (supra) do not require any clarification and should be 
construed as explained therein. 
 
xxx 
 
 
 
  xxx  
 
 
   xxx 
 
132. Insofar as our observations on the second issue are 
concerned, we clarify that the same were made in light of the 
observations made by this Court in many of its previous 
decisions, 
more 
particularly 
in Vidya 
Drolia (supra) 
and NTPC v. SPML (supra). However, in the case at hand, as 
is evident from the discussion in the preceding parts of this 
judgment, we have had the benefit of reconsidering certain 
aspects of the two decisions referred to above in the light of 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 25 of 31 
 
the pertinent observations made by a seven-Judge Bench of 
this Court in In Re : Interplay (supra). 
 
133. Thus, we clarify that while determining the issue of 
limitation in exercise of the powers under Section 11(6) of 
the Act, 1996, the referral court should limit its enquiry to 
examining whether Section 11(6) application has been filed 
within the period of limitation of three years or not. The date 
of commencement of limitation period for this purpose shall 
have to be construed as per the decision in Arif Azim (supra). 
As a natural corollary, it is further clarified that the referral 
courts, at the stage of deciding an application for 
appointment of arbitrator, must not conduct an intricate 
evidentiary enquiry into the question whether the claims 
raised by the applicant are time barred and should leave that 
question for determination by the arbitrator. Such an 
approach gives true meaning to the legislative intention 
underlying Section 11(6-A) of the Act, and also to the view 
taken in In Re : Interplay (supra). 
 
134. The observations made by us in Arif Azim (supra) are 
accordingly clarified. We need not mention that the effect of 
the aforesaid clarification is only to streamline the position 
of law, so as to bring it in conformity with the evolving 
principles of modern-day arbitration, and further to avoid 
the possibility of any conflict between the two decisions that 
may arise in future. These clarifications shall not be 
construed as affecting the verdict given by us in the facts 
of Arif Azim (supra), which shall be given full effect to 
notwithstanding the observations made herein.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
39.  Therefore, while determining the issue of limitation in the exercise of 
powers under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996, the referral court must only 
conduct a limited enquiry for the purpose of examining whether the Section 
11(6) application has been filed within the limitation period of three years or 
not. At this stage, it would not be proper for the referral court to indulge in 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 26 of 31 
 
an intricate evidentiary enquiry into the question of whether the claims raised 
by the petitioner are time barred. Such a determination must be left to the 
decision of the arbitrator. After all, in a scenario where the referral court is 
able to discern the frivolity in the litigation on the basis of bare minimum 
pleadings, it would be incorrect to assume or doubt that the arbitral tribunal 
would not be able to arrive at the same inference, especially when they are 
equipped with the power to undertake an extensive examination of the 
pleadings and evidence adduced before them.  
 
40. As observed by us in Krish Spinning (supra), the power of the referral court 
under Section 11 must essentially be seen in light of the fact that the parties 
do not have the right of appeal against any order passed by the referral court 
under Section 11, be it for either appointing or refusing to appoint an 
arbitrator. Therefore, if the referral court delves into the domain of the 
arbitral tribunal at the Section 11 stage and rejects the application of the 
claimant, we run a serious risk of leaving the claimant remediless for the 
adjudication of their claims. Moreover, the Courts are vested with the power 
of subsequent review in which the award passed by the arbitrator may be 
subjected to challenge by any party to the arbitration. Therefore, the Courts 
may take a second look at the adjudication done by the arbitral tribunal at a 
later stage, if considered necessary and appropriate in the circumstances.  
 
 
 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 27 of 31 
 
41. In view of the above discussion, we must restrict ourselves to examining 
whether the Section 11 petitions made before us are within limitation. The 
petitioner herein issued a notice invoking arbitration on 23.01.2017 and the 
same was delivered to both the respondents on 24.01.2017. However, the 
respondents failed to reply to the said notice within a period of 30 days i.e. 
within 23.02.2017. Therefore, the period of limitation of three years, for the 
purposes of a Section 11(6) petition, would begin to run from 23.02.2017 i.e., 
the date of failure or refusal by the other party to comply with the 
requirements mentioned in the notice invoking arbitration. The present 
petitions under Section 11(6) were filed on 09.04.2019. Even including the 
period during which the parties proceeded before the Bombay High Court 
which ultimately held that the applications before it were not maintainable 
i.e., 03.03.2017 to 22.02.2019, these petitions are well within the bounds of 
limitation.  
 
42.  The primary issue that has been canvassed by the respondents is that the 
substantive claims of the petitioner are ex-facie time barred and therefore, 
incapable of being referred to arbitration. The respondents contend that, with 
respect to the issue relating to the 2,00,010 equity shares, the petitioner has 
sought enforcement of the letter dated 22.09.2011 but has however, served a 
notice invoking arbitration 6 years later on 23.01.2017. Further, with respect 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 28 of 31 
 
to the 4,00,000 equity shares, it was contended that the claim can only arise 
upon the date of resignation i.e., 18.07.2013 and the claim would, therefore, 
again be time-barred. Conversely, the case of the petitioners is that the date 
of 15.10.2015 i.e., the date of the last legal notice sent by the respondents to 
the petitioner, can be considered as the date of cause of action for the 
purposes of limitation. In the alternative, they assert that there is no specific 
date or day on which it can be ascertained that the cause of action had arisen 
since there is a continuous breach of contract on part of the respondents. As 
evident from the aforesaid discussion and especially in light of the 
observations made in Krish Spinning (supra), this Court cannot conduct an 
intricate evidentiary enquiry into the question of when the cause of action 
can be said to have arisen between the parties and whether the claim raised 
by the petitioner is time barred. This has to be strictly left for the 
determination by the arbitral tribunal.  
 
 
43. All other submissions made by the parties regarding the entitlement of the 
petitioner to 4,00,000 and 2,00,010 equity shares in the respondent no.1 
company are concerned with the merits of the dispute which squarely falls 
within the domain of the arbitral tribunal. 
 
44. It is now well settled law that, at the stage of Section 11 application, the 
referral Courts need only to examine whether the arbitration agreement exists 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 29 of 31 
 
– nothing more, nothing less. This approach upholds the intention of the 
parties, at the time of entering into the agreement, to refer all disputes arising 
between themselves to arbitration. However, some parties might take undue 
advantage of such a limited scope of judicial interference of the referral 
courts and force other parties to the agreement into participating in a time-
consuming and costly arbitration process. This is especially possible in 
instances, including but not limited to, where the claimant canvasses either 
ex facie time-barred claims or claims which have been discharged through 
"accord and satisfaction", or cases where the impleadment of a non-signatory 
to the arbitration agreement is sought etc. In order to balance such a limited 
scope of judicial interference with the interests of the parties who might be 
constrained to participate in the arbitration proceedings, the arbitral tribunal 
may direct that the costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the party which 
the Tribunal ultimately finds to have abused the process of law and caused 
unnecessary harassment to the other party to the arbitration.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
V. CONCLUSION  
 
45.  The existence of the arbitration agreement as contained in Clause 13.10 of 
the Shareholders Agreement is not disputed by either of the parties. The 

 
 
Arbitration Petition No. 20 & 22 of 2019  
 
Page 30 of 31 
 
submissions as regard the claim of the petitioner being ex-facie time barred 
may be adjudicated upon by the arbitral tribunal as a preliminary issue.  
 
 
 
 
46. In view of the aforesaid, the present petitions are allowed. Taking into 
consideration the fact that an arbitral tribunal comprising of a sole arbitrator, 
Mr. Mayur Khandeparkar (Advocate, High Court of Judicature at Bombay) 
has already been constituted for the adjudication of disputes between the 
same parties in relation to the Service Agreement dated 18.10.2011, it would 
be desirable to constitute an arbitral tribunal comprising of the same sole 
arbitrator for adjudication of the present disputes pertaining to the 
Shareholders Agreement dated 25.07.2011. The fees of the arbitrator 
including other modalities shall be fixed in consultation with the parties.  
 
47. In the facts of the present case, it would be apposite to observe that, in the 
event the arbitral tribunal ultimately finds the present claims of the petitioner 
to be time-barred, it may direct that the costs of the arbitration pertaining to 
these claims be borne solely by the petitioner herein.  
 
 
 
48. It is made clear that all the other rights and contentions of the parties are left 
open for adjudication by the learned arbitrator.
