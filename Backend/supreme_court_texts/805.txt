On 13.04.2013, when she was still a child of less than twelve
years  of  age,  the  appellant  was  involved  in  an  accident  that  left  her
permanently disabled to the extent of 75%. The vehicle in which she was
travelling  with  her  father  was  hit  by  the  Max  Pick  Up  Van  bearing
Registration No. AS-01CC-3349. In the result, she suffers from severe
Hemiparesis in her left upper and lower limbs.

MAC Case No. 1431 of 2014 was filed on her behalf by her father,
Dhan Bahadur Thapa, before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal No. 3,
Kamrup  (Metro),  Guwahati  (for  brevity,  ‘the  MACT’).  M/s.  Oriental
Insurance Company Limited, with which the offending Max Pick Up Van
was stated to have been insured, was arrayed as Opposite Party No. 1
while the owner and driver of the said Van were shown as Opposite Parties
No. 2 and 3. By judgment dated 23.02.2018, the MACT held that the
vehicle in question was duly insured with M/s. Oriental Insurance Company
Limited by its owner, Opposite Party No. 2, and that the driver, Opposite
Party No. 3, who possessed a valid Driving License at the relevant time,
had caused the accident due to rash and negligent driving. 
4.
The MACT then considered the issue of compensation in the light
of the material placed before it. Apropos the disability suffered by the
appellant, the MACT took note of the fact that the Disability Certificate
dated 12.07.2017 (Ext.8) quantified her permanent disability at 75% but
chose to reduce it to 50%, opining that there was possibility of improvement
in her condition. Further, though a sum of  ₹13 lakh was claimed for the
medical treatment of the appellant, her father could produce bills only for
the  sum  of  ₹84,771/-.  The  MACT,  therefore,  acted  upon  the  bills  so
produced. As regards determination of the loss of earnings of the appellant,
2

the MACT opined that a child could not be equated to a ‘Non-earning
person’ in Clause 6 in the Second Schedule to the Motor Vehicles Act,
1988, whose notional income was to be taken as 1
₹ 5000/- per annum. In
all, the MACT determined that a sum of  ₹5,59,771/-, along with interest
thereon @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till
realization, was to be paid by the insurance company. The break-up of the
MACT’s quantification reads as under:
No.

Dissatisfied  with  this  compensation,  the  appellant,  through her
father,  filed  an  appeal  in  MACApp./539/2018  before  the  Gauhati  High
Court. By judgment dated 20.02.2023, a learned Judge of the Gauhati High
Court  disposed  of  the  said  appeal,  enhancing  the  compensation  to
3

₹18,97,371/-. The learned Judge was of the opinion that the appellant’s
permanent disability, as per Ext.8 disability certificate, ought to have been
accepted and accordingly assessed the same as 75%. The learned Judge
placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Master Ayush vs. Branch
Manager, Reliance General Insurance Company Limited and another1,
which involved determination of compensation payable to a five-year old
victim of a road accident, and held that compensation in that regard was to
be assessed as per the minimum wages on the assumption that the victim
would have been able to earn after attaining adulthood. The learned Judge,
accordingly, took note of the minimum wages payable to unskilled labour at
the time of the accident, i.e., ₹169 per day, and computed the notional loss
of income of the appellant as ₹5,070/- per month. The multiplier was taken
as 15 in terms of the age of the appellant and the loss of earnings was
worked out as ₹9,12,600/- (₹5070X12x15). In addition thereto, the learned
Judge held that a sum of ₹3 lakh was payable for pain, suffering and loss
of amenities; and a further sum of  ₹3 lakh was payable towards loss of
marriage  prospects.  The  learned  Judge,  however,  confirmed  that  the
medical expenses would be as per the bills produced, i.e., ₹84,771/-. In all,
the learned Judge determined the compensation payable to the appellant

as ₹18,97,371/-. The interest component was left intact. The break-up of
the learned Judge’s quantification is as under:

      The learned Judge directed that a sum of ₹5,59,771/- should be
immediately released to the appellant’s father and the rest of the amount
should be invested in one or more fixed deposit(s) so as to attract the
maximum rate of interest. 
6.
Claiming that the compensation determined by the learned Judge
was still on the lower side, the appellant chose to file the present appeal
through her father. She quantified her total claim under various heads at
₹71,80,000/-.  M/s. Oriental Insurance Company Limited, respondent No. 1
before us, is represented by learned counsel. The owner of the vehicle,
respondent No. 2, did not choose to appear despite service of notice. The
5

driver of the vehicle, respondent No. 3, stood deleted from the array of
parties at the risk of the appellant, vide order dated 20.03.2024.  
7.
On 13.09.2024, upon hearing the learned counsel for the parties,
this Court directed them to submit their respective computations of the
damages/compensation. Both parties accordingly filed their computation
statements. The insurance company, while asserting that the compensation
determined  by  the  High  Court  was  just  and  proper,  stated  that  token
compensation, between  ₹4 lakh to 5 lakh, may be awarded towards
₹
attendant charges. The appellant, however, filed a statement computing her
total claim, aggregating to ₹48,68,000/- under various heads. 
8.
At this stage, we may note that this Court had occasion to consider
a similar case involving a twelve-year-old child in Kajal v. Jagdish Chand
and others2. In that case, the child had suffered 90% permanent disability
due to the accident. The argument before this Court was that as the child
was just twelve years of age, notional income of  ₹15,000/- per annum
should  be  adopted.  However,  this  Court  rejected  this  argument  and
adopted the minimum wages payable to a skilled workman for quantifying
the notional loss of earnings of the child. In the case on hand, the High
Court adopted the minimum wages payable to unskilled labour, i.e., 1
₹ 69
per day, but there is no justification for the same as the appellant was a
2
(2020) 4 SCC 413
6

school-going child at the time of her accident. The minimum wages payable
to a skilled  workman,  as per  the  Notification  dated  01.03.2013  of  the
Government of Assam, stood at ₹175 per day, which is more acceptable.
On that basis, the notional loss of income of the appellant would work out
to  ₹5,250/-  per  month  and  the  multiplier  applicable  would  be  15,
considering her age at the time of the accident. In effect, the notional loss
of earnings would work out to ₹9,45,000/- (₹5250X12x15). The High Court
failed to consider the loss of future prospects @ 40% of the monthly salary,
in terms of the law laid down by this Court in Kajal (supra). Therefore, a
further  sum  of  ₹3,78,000/-  (₹2100X12x15)  would  be  payable  to  the
appellant under that head. The sum of ₹3 lakh computed by the High Court
for  pain,  suffering  and  loss  of  amenities  is  just  and  warrants  no
interference. Similarly, the compensation of  ₹3 lakh for loss of marriage
prospects  is  sufficient.  However,  though  the  High  Court  calculated
compensation  for  future  medical  treatment  as  ₹3  lakh,  we  are  of  the
opinion that the same would be deficient, given the nature of the permanent
disability suffered by the appellant. She would be entitled to ₹5 lakh under
this  head,  as  claimed  by  her  in  her  computation  statement.  Further,
attendant charges would also have to be considered as the appellant would
be helpless without assistance. In Kajal (supra), this Court opined that the
7

multiplier method would be the most realistic and reasonable method for
this purpose. The monthly expense for one attendant was quantified as
5,000/-. Adopting the same, the appellant would be entitled to 9 lakh
₹
₹
under this head. Though, the claim for  ₹13 lakh towards the expenses
incurred for treatment and hospitalization is reiterated, the fact remains that
the  appellant’s  father  could  produce  bills  only  for  ₹84,771/-.  We  are,
therefore, not inclined to accept this claim without proof. In effect, the
appellant is held entitled to the following compensation:       
No.

The insurance company shall also pay interest @ 7.5% on the
balance amount payable, as determined by us above, from the date of
institution of the claim petition till the date of deposit by it before the Motor
8

Accident  Claims  Tribunal  No.  3,  Kamrup  (Metro),  Guwahati.  The  said
amount shall be placed in one or more fixed deposit(s) in nationalized
bank(s) for terms which would earn the maximum interest. Such interest
shall be disbursed to the appellant or her father on monthly basis. It would,
however, be open to the appellant or her father to approach the said
Tribunal for release of a larger sum of money, if any requirement arises and
the  same  is  demonstrated  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Tribunal.  Such
application,  if  filed,  shall  be  considered  by  the  Tribunal  on  the  facts
obtaining and in accordance with law.
The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above. 
Parties shall bear their own costs.
