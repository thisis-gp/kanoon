WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO. 110 OF 2006: 
 
1. 
This writ petition has been filed under Article 32 
of the Constitution of India by the petitioner-People’s 
Rights and Social Research Centre, a Delhi-based 
non-governmental organization, seeking intervention 
of this Court in addressing the grave issue of 
“Silicosis” among workers in various industries 
across the country. The petitioner organization,

December 20, 1999, has been actively involved in 
occupational health work, specifically concerning 
stone crusher workers, stone quarry workers and 
construction workers.  
2. 
Silicosis is an incurable occupational lung 
disease caused by prolonged inhalation of silica dust 
and it has been rampant throughout India due to 
inadequate detection, monitoring, and remedial 
measures. It predominantly affects workers engaged 
in industries such as mining, construction, stone 
cutting, and sandblasting, where they are exposed to 
high levels of silica dust. Over time, the inhaled silica 
particles cause inflammation and scarring of the lung 
tissue, leading to reduced lung function and severe 
respiratory distress. The disease manifests in three 
forms: chronic, accelerated, and acute silicosis, 
depending on the intensity and duration of exposure. 
Chronic silicosis, the most common form, develops 
over 10 to 30 years of low to moderate exposure, while 
accelerated and acute forms occur over shorter 
periods with higher exposure levels. The symptoms 
include shortness of breath, persistent cough, chest 
pain, and fatigue, often leading to severe disability 
and premature death. Despite its preventable nature 
through adequate safety measures, monitoring, and 

WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 110 OF 2006 
 
Page 3 of 20 
 
use of protective equipment, the lack of stringent 
enforcement and awareness has resulted in a 
significant number of workers contracting this 
debilitating disease. The petitioner underscores the 
urgent need for systemic reforms to address the 
detection, prevention, and treatment of silicosis to 
protect the health and rights of workers across the 
country. 
3. 
The petitioner contends that the pervasive and 
unchecked prevalence of silicosis among workers in 
various industries constitutes a violation of the 
workers’ fundamental rights under the Constitution 
of India. Central to this petition is the assertion that 
the right to health, safety, and a life of dignity, 
enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution, is 
being grossly neglected. Furthermore, the Petitioner 
invokes the Directive Principles of State Policy, 
particularly Articles 39(e) and 42 of the Constitution 
of India which mandate the State to ensure that the 
health and strength of workers is not abused and 
that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to 
enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength. 
The petitioner argues that the State's failure to 
protect workers from hazardous conditions and 
provide adequate medical care, compensation, and 

WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 110 OF 2006 
 
Page 4 of 20 
 
rehabilitation is a direct infringement of these 
constitutional mandates. Additionally, the petitioner 
submits that the Right to a clean and healthy 
environment, as implicit under Article 48A, is being 
violated.  The petitioner also references Article 43, 
which directs the State to ensure a living wage, 
conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life, 
and full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural 
opportunities for workers.   
4. 
The Petitioner organization highlights the lack 
of sufficient insurance, treatment, compensation, 
and rehabilitation for victims and their families.  The 
Petitioner has urged this Court to direct the 
constitution 
of 
a 
high-level 
committee 
to 
comprehensively 
address 
the 
detection 
and 
management of silicosis and other occupational 
diseases 
among 
workers, 
particularly 
in 
the 
unorganized sector. Furthermore, the Petitioner 
seeks guidelines for the prevention and treatment of 
such diseases, the rehabilitation of affected persons 
and families, compensation for the families of 
deceased workers, and alternative employment 
opportunities for the victims' family members.

5.2. 
On 25.07.2008, NHRC was permitted to 
implead the Central Pollution Control Board2 as 
a party.  
5.3. 
On 5.3.2009, pursuant to court’s order, 
the NHRC submitted its preliminary report on a 
survey on silicosis affecting workers in various 
industries which showed that the issue is 
widespread across many states, and further 
surveys were needed. The Ministry of Health and 
Ministry of Labour, Union of India, were directed 
to provide all necessary assistance to the NHRC 
for further action regarding silicosis. The NHRC 
was directed to address specific confirmed cases 
of silicosis, recommending immediate medical 
relief for sufferers and compensation for families 
of those who died due to the said disease.  
5.4. 
On 01.02.2010, the State of Madhya 
Pradesh was also added as a respondent in this 
matter.  
5.5. 
On 12.11.2010, following an order of this

Page 7 of 20 
 
and recommending compensation to them. The 
report observed that there was failure on the part 
of the enforcement agencies in Gujarat to ensure 
protection of the mine workers in Godhra and it 
recommended an amount of Rs 3,00,000/- as 
compensation to the next of kins of the 238 
workers who had died due to Silicosis. Moreover, 
the 304 workers which had come from the State 
of Madhya Pradesh to work in Gujarat as mine 
workers were directed to be given rehabilitation 
packages by the relevant authorities of the State 
of Madhya Pradesh.  
5.6. 
On 18.2.2014, given the prevalence of the 
issue in this matter, the Court impleaded the 
remaining States as Respondents in this matter.  
5.7. 
On 4.5.2016, the Court observed that the 
directions issued in the report submitted by the 
NHRC on 12.11.2010 were not followed by the 
State of Gujarat. The Employees State Insurance 
Corporation3 
was 
impleaded 
as 
a 
party-
respondent through its Director General. The 
State of Gujarat was directed to comply with 
NHRC's recommendation by paying ₹1 lakh to 
 
3 ESIC 

WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 110 OF 2006 
 
Page 8 of 20 
 
the kins of each of the 238 deceased workers and 
depositing remaining ₹2 lakhs in their names in 
fixed deposits within one month. The Chief 
Secretary of Gujarat was directed to transfer ₹3 
lakhs per deceased worker to the District 
Collectors 
of 
Jhabua 
and 
Alirajpur 
for 
distribution. The distribution was to be handled 
by the District Collectors, and assistance from 
ESIC could be sought if needed. The State of 
Madhya Pradesh was directed to file an affidavit 
detailing the rehabilitation steps for the 304 
affected individuals identified by NHRC. The 
CPCB was also ordered to file an affidavit on 
actions taken based on the Committee's report 
on silicosis and pneumoconiosis in Godhra, 
Gujarat. 
5.8. 
On 23.8.2016, the Court reviewed the 
affidavit filed by the District Collectors of the 
affected regions in the State of Gujarat and 
acknowledged their efforts in ensuring the 
compensation was received by the next of kins of 
the victims. The Court also reviewed the 
Additional Affidavit filed by the CPCB and 
observed that 16 out of 30 operational quartz 
grinding units in Gujarat were non-compliant 

WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 110 OF 2006 
 
Page 9 of 20 
 
with statutory mandates. The CPCB also made 
recommendations for the State Pollution Control 
Board4 to address deficiencies. The Court 
directed the SPCB to file an affidavit within four 
weeks on actions taken based on these 
recommendations and on closing down 14 non-
operational units. It was further stated that if 
non-compliant units intend to restart, they must 
meet mandatory requirements. SPCB must 
ensure compliance with mandatory pollution 
prevention measures and take steps to close non-
compliant units. The CPCB also conducted an 
inspection of the quartz grinding units in the 
State of Gujarat and had made the following 
recommendations: 
“i. Adequate provision of dust extraction 
systems shall be made at potential sources 
such as jaw crusher hoppers, transfer points 
of 
materials 
from 
conveyor 
belts, 
disintegrators, transfer points of materials 
from 
bucket 
elevators 
to 
other 
plant 
equipment, 
rotary 
screens, 
magnetic 
separators, vibratory screens, etc. The dust 
extraction systems of such potential sources 
shall be routed through an Air Pollution 
Control Device (APCD). Stacks attached to 
APCDs are to be equipped with adequate 
 
4 SPCB

Page 10 of 20 
 
monitoring facilities as per CPCB Emission 
Regulation, Part-III. 
ii. The height of the stack shall be maintained 
at a minimum of 2 meters above the roof level 
as prescribed by the Board. 
iii. 
Sheds 
provided 
for 
plant 
process 
machineries shall be closed properly, and 
provision of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) 
cameras shall be made rather than keeping 
small openings in the shed for frequent 
observations. 
iv. The internal roads shall be made of 
bitumen/concrete to reduce fugitive emissions 
by vehicular movement, with proper cleaning 
and wetting mechanisms. 
v. Provision of a green belt shall be made 
along the periphery of the individual units. 
vi. Provision shall be made for systematic 
water sprinkling at places of dust generation 
to reduce fugitive emissions, and records of 
water utilization shall be maintained. 
vii. A telescopic chute or any other system 
shall be adopted to reduce fugitive emissions 
while loading the products into trucks or fine 
dust in bags. 
viii. 
Provision 
of 
Personal 
Protective 
Equipment (dust masks, helmets, safety 
shoes, goggles, earplugs) and utilization by all 
workers during the operation of the plant shall 
be ensured. 
ix. The units shall ensure environmental 
monitoring and submission of reports to GPCB 
at regular intervals. 
x. The housekeeping shall be improved. 

WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 110 OF 2006 
 
Page 11 of 20 
 
xi. The units shall submit a time-bound action 
plan to comply with the above measures 
within 30 days.”  
 
5.9. 
Hence, pursuant to the recommendation 
of the CPCB, the Court directed the SPCB 
Chairmen of Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya 
Pradesh, Puducherry, Jharkhand, and Delhi to 
inspect 
quartz 
grinding 
units 
and 
report 
deficiencies within three weeks. SPCB Chairmen 
were directed to personally visit units’ post-
compliance period and take steps to close non-
compliant units.  
5.10. 
The 
State 
of 
Madhya 
Pradesh 
had 
identified 334 silicosis-affected individuals who 
claimed rehabilitation actions. The District Legal 
Services Authorities of Jhabua, Alirajpur, and 
Dhar were directed to verify actual distribution of 
benefits and submit a report within eight weeks. 
They were to ensure that no silicosis-affected 
individual was deprived of benefits. In case of 
deceased victims, compensation was to be 
processed as per policy. 
 
5.11. 
The Court made further observation on the 
general problems of silicosis in India and 

WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 110 OF 2006 
 
Page 12 of 20 
 
observed that the severity of the problems is 
mainly in the States of Delhi, Haryana, 
Rajasthan, 
Madhya 
Pradesh, 
Gujarat, 
Jharkhand, and Puducherry. The NHRC had 
conducted a detailed survey on this issue and 
submitted 
a 
report 
to 
the 
duty 
holders 
concerned. But the court noted that no 
meaningful action has been taken either in any 
of the prevention and rehabilitation areas. The 
Court made further observations that vide order 
dated 30th January 2008 in W.P.(C) No. 79 of 
2005 titled 'Occupational Health & Safety 
Association Versus Union of India & Ors.' this 
Court had considered certain aspects on the 
reduction of occupational hazards 
of the 
employees of the Thermal Power Stations in the 
country and had also issued the following 
directions:  
“i. Comprehensive medical check-up of all 
workers in all coal-fired thermal power stations 
by doctors appointed in consultation with the 
trade unions. The first medical check-up is to 
be completed within six months. 
ii. Free and comprehensive medical treatment 
to be provided to all workmen found to be 
suffering 
from 
an 
occupational 
disease, 
ailment, or accident until cured or until death. 

WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 110 OF 2006 
 
Page 13 of 20 
 
iii. Services of the workmen not to be 
terminated during illness and to be treated as 
if on duty. 
iv. Compensation to be paid to workmen 
suffering from any occupational disease, 
ailment, or accident in accordance with the 
provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act 
1923. 
v. Modern protective equipment to be provided 
to workmen as recommended by an expert 
body in consultation with the trade unions. 
vi. Strict control measures to be immediately 
adopted for the control of dust, heat, noise, 
vibration, and radiation to be recommended by 
the National Institute of Occupational Health 
(NIOH), Ahmedabad, Gujarat. 
vii. All employers to abide by the Code of 
Practice on Occupational Safety and Health 
Audit as developed by the Bureau of Indian 
Standards. 
viii. Safe methods to be followed for the 
handling, collection, and disposal of hazardous 
waste to be recommended by NIOH. 
ix. Appointment of a Committee of experts by 
NIOH including representatives from trade 
unions and Health and Safety NGOs to look 
into the issue of Health and Safety of workers 
and make recommendations.” 
 
5.12. 
The Court noted that these directions 
would be applicable to silica units as well. There 
was a direction to the Chief Secretary of the 
respective States to file an affidavit, after 

WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 110 OF 2006 
 
Page 14 of 20 
 
convening a meeting of the duty holders 
regarding the implementation of the various 
reports, and to file an affidavit as to the action 
taken in the respective states. The Court made it 
clear that it was not concerned with any policy 
framework of the State. The report was on the 
benefits which have actually been made available 
to the victims. The Court also directed the Chief 
Secretary of the States concerned to submit a 
detailed report as above within a period of two 
months from today, failing which they will be 
present before this Court at their own expense on 
the next date of hearing. The court assigned 
various specialists across the State of India to 
constitute an enquiry and report to the court 
with regard to the medical facilities available to 
the patients affected by silicosis and whether any 
compensation was made available to them, etc. 
The required expenditure was to be borne by the 
State concerned where the enquiry is being 
conducted. On the legal framework, the learned 
senior counsel appearing for the petitioners had 
brought to the notice that the duty holders were 
the Director General of Mines Safety (DGMS), 
Ministry of Labour & Employment, Government 

WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 110 OF 2006 
 
Page 15 of 20 
 
of India, and the Director General, Factory Advice 
Service and Labour Institutes (DG-FASLI), 
Government of India. The court directed the 
above duty holders to submit a report on the 
following aspects:  
i. 
“The 
geographical 
location 
and 
the 
industries/mines state-wise where workers at 
risk of silicosis are to be found.  
ii. The number of workers working at these 
sites and the estimates of the number of 
workers 
suffering 
from 
silicosis/ 
pneumoconiosis in the country, state-wise, and 
industry/mine-wise.  
iii. The details of the number of workers 
suffering from silicosis/pneumoconiosis, their 
medical treatment, and compensation paid. 
iv. Details of the number of workers who died 
due to silicosis during the last 10 years and the 
compensation, if any, paid.”  
 
5.13. 
Thereafter, the Court also directed the 
Director General of Mines Safety5 and the 
Director General, Factory Advice Service and 
Labour Institutes (DG-FASLI) to carry out a 
health and safety survey of silicosis-affected 
workers under section 91A of the Factories Act 
and section 9A of the Mines Act, by actively 
involving, apart from government officials, non-
 
5 DGMS 

WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 110 OF 2006 
 
Page 16 of 20 
 
government organizations working in silicosis-
affected areas, and submit a comprehensive 
report to the Court as to the facilities available in 
the field of treatment, actual payment of 
compensation made available to the victims, and 
other rehabilitation steps for the affected workers 
and their family members. The Court directed the 
Chief Secretary of each State to make all 
arrangements for facilitating the survey and 
preparation of the reports by the doctors 
concerned in each State. 
5.14. 
On 10.2.2017, the Court allowed the 
impleadment application of Silicosis Peedit 
Sangh.   
5.15. 
On 1.5.2017, the Court reiterated the 
order dated 23.8.2016 regarding compensation 
for those affected by and deceased from silicosis 
to be implemented by all States. The NHRC was 
permitted to file its recommendations. The CPCB 
was directed to file an affidavit detailing whether 
the recommendations in its report were being 
followed by quartz and other silica dust-
producing industries. 
5.16. 
On 05.03.2019, the Court reviewed the 
report submitted by CPCB filed on 24.7.2017 

WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 110 OF 2006 
 
Page 17 of 20 
 
after the inspection of polluting units which had 
been 
functioning 
in 
the 
respondent-State. 
According to them, a grim picture of large-scale 
environmental law violations was taking place 
which led to serious health problems and deaths 
in affected areas.  
5.17. 
Mr. Prashant Bhushan, counsel for the 
Petitioner, suggested further steps needed to be 
taken to ensure the closure of these polluting 
units.  The Respondent counsel indicated that 
many units have been ordered to be closed, and 
further action is being taken for the closure of 
non-functional and still-operating units. It was 
submitted that the respondents-States who 
allowed such units to operate should be made to 
pay adequate compensation to the victims. The 
Union of India be also directed to submit their 
response to the Reports submitted by the NHRC.  
6. 
Having perused the various reports submitted 
by the respective State Committees, the NHRC, the 
CPCB, and the DGMS, the instant writ petition raises 
two primary aspects for consideration. For both these 
aspects, there are statutory bodies duly constituted. 
They would be in a better position to monitor and 
oversee that the mandate of law and the earlier 

WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 110 OF 2006 
 
Page 18 of 20 
 
directions issued by this Court are not only duly 
implemented but further necessary steps are also 
undertaken. 
7. 
Firstly, the environmental aspect of the matter 
pertains to ensuring that industries abide by certain 
minimal standards to prevent silicosis among their 
workers. In the event of non-compliance, these 
industries should face closure. In our considered 
opinion, the National Green Tribunal6 is the 
appropriate authority to oversee this aspect of the 
matter. The NGT, established under the National 
Green Tribunal Act in 2010, is tasked with the 
expeditious 
disposal 
of 
cases 
related 
to 
environmental 
protection 
and 
the 
speedy 
implementation of decisions. Given that this writ 
petition was filed in 2006, prior to the establishment 
of the NGT, these matters could not have been 
presented before the Tribunal initially. However, we 
now direct the NGT to oversee the impact of silicosis-
prone industries and factories across India and 
ensure that the CPCB and the respective SPCBs 
comply with the earlier directions of this Court. 
Furthermore, we direct the NGT to undertake any 
 
6 NGT 

WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 110 OF 2006 
 
Page 19 of 20 
 
additional necessary steps to prevent the spread of 
silicosis by such industries and factories. 
8. 
The second aspect concerns ensuring that 
adequate compensation is received by the affected 
workers or their next of kins as swiftly as possible. In 
this regard, we direct the NHRC to oversee the 
compensation process across the respective states. 
We also direct the ESIC and the Chief Secretaries of 
the respective states to adhere to the directions of the 
NHRC and collaborate with them to ensure that the 
compensation distribution process is carried out 
efficiently and without delay. 
9. 
We further direct the Registry of this Court to 
ensure that all the relevant reports and affidavits 
pertaining to this matter, as submitted by the 
respective State Committees, the CPCB, the NHRC, 
and the DGMS, are forwarded to the NGT and the 
NHRC 
to 
facilitate 
the 
execution 
of 
their 
responsibilities effectively and swiftly. Petitioners 
would also be at liberty to approach the NGT and 
NHRC and extend all cooperation in implementation 
of the directions. 
10. The Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of.
