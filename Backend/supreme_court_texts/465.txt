Leave granted. 
2. 
Since the issues raised in both the captioned appeals are 
the same and the challenge is also to the self-same judgment and 
order passed by the High Court of Uttarakhand, those were taken 
up for hearing analogously and are being disposed of by this 
common judgment and order.  
A. FACTUAL MATRIX 
 
3. 
These appeals arise from the common judgment and order 
passed by the High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital dated 
02.11.2018 in Special Appeal No. 523 of 2014, Special Appeal 
No. 524 of 2014, Special Appeal No.128 of 2015, Writ Petition No. 
439 of 2015 and Writ Petition No. 776 of 2015 resply by which 
the High Court dismissed the appeals filed by the appellants 
herein and thereby affirmed the judgment and order passed by 
the learned single Judge of the High Court dated 05.08.2014 in 
Writ Petition No. 341 of 2012 filed by the respondents herein.  
4. 
The controversy involved in the present litigation falls 
within a very narrow compass. We need not state the facts in 
detail as the order passed by a coordinate Bench of this Court 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 3 of 91 
 
dated 15.02.2021 speaks for itself and gives more than a fair idea 
as regards the dispute between the parties. The order dated 
15.02.2021 reads thus:- 
“1. Delay condoned. 
 
2. We have heard Mr Sajan Poovayya, learned Senior 
Counsel 
appearing 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Bengal 
Engineering Group and Centre, the petitioner in the 
Special Leave Petitions arising out of SLP (C) Diary No 
24505 of 2020, with Mr Abhinav Agrawal, learned 
counsel, Mr Naresh Kaushik, learned counsel 
appearing on behalf of Army Welfare Education 
Society1, petitioner in the Special Leave Petition 
arising out of SLP(C) Diary No 26155 of 2020 and Mr 
Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned Senior Counsel 
appearing on behalf of the caveators. 
 
3. The submission which has been urged by the 
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners 
is that the Bengal Engineering Group and Centre had 
entered into a lease agreement with the Institute of 
Brothers of St. Gabriel in respect of the land, which is 
a B-3 class land under the Cantonment. A School was 
being conducted by St Gabriel’s Academy. After the 
term of the lease came to an end, a decision was 
taken to run a school under the auspices of AWES. 
AWES runs about 139 schools all over the country. 
On 28 February 2012, a letter was addressed to the 
staff of the school indicating that those among the 
teachers who are eligible in terms of CBSE guidelines 
would be considered for appointment on ad hoc basis 
for one year and would have to appear and qualify in 
a written test under AWES Rules and the teachers 
will be paid salary at par with the service conditions 
applicable to other teachers of the Army Public 
Schools. This gave rise to the filing of a writ petition 
before the High Court of Uttarakhand. The Single 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 4 of 91 
 
Judge allowed the writ petition by issuing a 
mandamus to the petitioners not to vary the service 
conditions of the teaching and nonteaching staff to 
their disadvantage. During the pendency of the 
proceedings before the Division Bench in appeal, an 
order was passed by the High Court on 6 January 
2016. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the order read as 
follows: 
 
“3. BEG has decided to run the institution as 
an Army School under the Army Welfare 
Education Society (AWES), which has also 
come up in appeal against the judgment. 
According to AWES, it is running 134 schools 
all over India. They have a complaint that, at 
present, for the past two years since 1st April 
2012, they are collecting fees at the rates 
they are collecting in the other Army Public 
Schools and, yet, they have been compelled 
to pay the salary, which is being paid to the 
teachers earlier by St. Gabriel’s, which was 
in fact collecting far more fees and there is a 
huge deficit. According to them, they will not 
terminate the services of the teachers and 
non-teaching staff, if AWES is permitted to 
take over; but, they will be paid the salary in 
terms of the standards, which they have in 
respect of the other Army Public Schools. It is 
their case that they are prepared to allow the 
teachers and non-teaching staff to continue, 
provided some modalities are complied with, 
relevance of which may not present itself 
immediately. According to the teachers and 
non-teaching staff, they have a right to 
continue as such. 
 
4. We would think that the interest of justice 
requires that the arrangement, which has 
been ordered by the Court in Writ Petition No. 
776 of 2015 (M/S) must be modified. 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 5 of 91 
 
Accordingly, we modify the order and direct 
that AWES can take over the management of 
the school and the teaching and other non-
teaching staff will be allowed to continue, 
however, with the modification that the pay 
will be such as they would be entitled to 
treating it as another Army Public School. 
This arrangement will be provisional and 
subject to the result of the litigation and 
without prejudice to the contentions of the 
parties. The Committee will handover the 
management to the AWES upon production of 
a certified copy of this order. The accounts, 
etc., will also be handed over to the Principal 
of the school. We record the submission of 
the learned counsel appearing for St 
Gabriel's that they will handover the amount 
representing 
gratuity, 
earned 
leave 
encashment and the installment of the sixth 
pay commission directly to the teachers and 
other nonteaching staff. We make it clear 
that the school can be run in terms of the 
Rules of AWES otherwise. The payment of 
salary as per AWES can commence from 1st 
January, 2016.” 
 
4. The Division Bench eventually dismissed the 
Special Appeal against the judgment of the Single 
Judge, which has given rise to the proceedings before 
this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. 
 
5. On behalf of the petitioners, it was submitted that 
the teaching and nonteaching staff were employees 
of St Gabriel’s Academy and since the erstwhile 
management has ceased to conduct the school, the 
staff would have no claim as against AWES which is 
conducting the school, at present. 
 
6. In order to resolve the dispute, a suggestion has 
been made by learned counsel for the petitioners to 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 6 of 91 
 
the effect that the teaching and non-teaching staff of 
the erstwhile school which is continuing with the 
present school, which is conducted by AWES, would 
be continued on a permanent basis. However, it has 
been submitted that their conditions of service will be 
those which are applicable to the teaching and non-
teaching staff of Army Public Schools. It has been 
submitted that under the judgment of the High Court 
the petitioners would be obligated to provide service 
conditions at par with the teaching and nonteaching 
staff 
which 
was 
recruited 
by 
the 
erstwhile 
management which would involve an outlay which 
the Army Public School will not be in a financial 
position to meet. That apart, it has been submitted 
that there cannot be two sets of service conditions in 
respect of the same school. 
 
7. Responding to the above submissions, Mr Gopal 
Sankaranarayanan with Mr B Shravanth Shanker, 
learned counsel, submitted that there are two areas 
which would require to be resolved, namely,: 
 
(i) Seniority of the teaching and non-teaching 
staff due to the past service should be taken 
into account; and 
(ii) In computing their terminal dues, benefit of the 
past service should be taken into reckoning. 
 
8. We find prima facie that the suggestions which 
have emerged from both the sides are fair and proper 
in their own way, in order to resolve the dispute 
amicably. If the dispute is eventually resolved 
amicably, it would be ensured that, on the one hand, 
the teaching and non-teaching staff of the erstwhile 
school would not be displaced and continue to get 
employment in the present school and, at the same 
time, their service conditions are at par with those 
which are applicable to the employees of the Army 
Public Schools. 
 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 7 of 91 
 
9. In order to enable the Court to give the parties an 
opportunity to resolve the dispute finally, we are of 
the view that a meeting should be held between the 
concerned authorities of the School as well as the 
representatives of the employees in the presence of 
the learned Senior Counsel so that agreed terms for 
resolving the dispute finally can be presented before 
this Court. 
 
10. To facilitate this, we stand over the proceedings 
by a period of four weeks. The proceedings shall now 
be listed on 22 March 2021. In the meantime, we 
request all the parties to ensure that a meeting is 
convened within a period of one week from today so 
that progress can effectively be made towards a 
satisfactory resolution of the dispute in a spirit of 
dialogue in which the parties have addressed the 
Court. 
 
11. We direct that no further steps shall be taken in 
the contempt proceedings till the next date of listing. 
 
12. The services of the teaching and non-teaching 
staff who are continuing in the management of the 
Army Public School at Roorkee, at present, shall not 
be disturbed in the meantime.” 
 
5. 
It appears that after the aforesaid order was passed, the 
following order dated 23.07.2021 came to be passed:- 
“1. Issue notice. 
 
2. Mr Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned Senior 
Counsel, appears on behalf of the first respondent 
with Mr B Shravanth Shanker, learned counsel and 
waives service. 
 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 8 of 91 
 
3. Pending further orders, we stay the operation of 
the judgments and orders of the High Court dated 2 
November 2018 in SPA Nos 523 and 524 of 2014, 
Writ Petition Nos 439 of 2015 and 776 of 2015 and 
SPA No 128 of 2015 and dated 9 October 2020 in 
MCC No 1623 of 2018 and 1626 of 2018, subject to 
the following conditions: 
 
(i) The respondent – employees who are 
presently in service shall continue to be on 
the rolls of Army Public School No 2 
conducted by the Army Welfare Education 
Society1 at Roorkee; and 
 
(ii) The employees shall be entitled to receive 
their emoluments and other conditions of 
service at par with the other employees of the 
corresponding grade who are engaged by the 
AWES in Army Public School No 2.” 
 
B. ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION  
 
6. 
The following two questions of law fall for our 
consideration:- 
a. Whether the appellant Army Welfare Education 
Society is a “State” within Article 12 of the 
Constitution of India so as to make a writ petition 
under Article 226 of the Constitution maintainable 
against it? In other words, whether a service dispute 
in the private realm involving a private educational 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 9 of 91 
 
institution and its employees can be adjudicated 
upon in a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the 
Constitution? 
b. Even if it is assumed that the appellant Army 
Welfare Education Society is a body performing 
public duty amenable to writ jurisdiction, whether 
all its decisions are subject to judicial review or only 
those decisions which have public law element 
therein can be judicially reviewed under the writ 
jurisdiction? 
C. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 
  
7. 
Mr. Naresh Kaushik, the learned senior counsel appearing 
for the appellant submitted that the respondents originally were 
employees of an unaided private minority public school by the 
name St. Gabriel’s Academy.  As St. Gabriel’s Academy is no 
longer in existence, the teaching and non-teaching staff of St. 
Gabriel’s Academy came to be absorbed by the appellant society. 
In such circumstances, according to the learned counsel, the writ 
petition filed by the respondents before the High Court, by itself, 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 10 of 91 
 
was not maintainable. According to him, the learned single Judge 
committed a serious error in entertaining such writ petition at 
the instance of the respondents herein. Even the appeal Court 
committed the same error.   
8. 
It was further submitted that the appellant is a wholly 
unaided private society which was established to provide 
educational facility to meet the needs of the children of the army 
personnel including the widows and ex-servicemen. It was 
pointed out that the appellant society is running many schools 
and institutions and the entire finance for the purpose of 
administration is managed from the fees collected from the 
students of the respective school and institution. 
9. 
It was argued that there was no privity of contract between 
the appellant society and the staff of St. Gabriel’s Academy. It 
was also argued that St. Gabriel’s Academy was being run and 
administered by an unaided private minority society and the 
appointment/termination of the staff was vested with the 
Brothers of St Gabriel’s only. Further, the Provincial Superior of 
the Institute of Brothers of St. Gabriel’s was the Chairman of 
School Management Committee (SMC) of St. Gabriel’s Academy 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 11 of 91 
 
as well. The Provincial Superior of the Society is the appointing 
authority, as well as the appellate authority for the staff, and can 
appoint/terminate/retire the staff, in their schools. Further, the 
Provincial Superior of the Society used to be the Head of School 
Managing Committee vested with the power to appoint/nominate 
the members as per their rules and regulations. The appellant 
had no role to play in the affairs of the said school or its 
management. 
10. 
It was also argued that the education of children is 
certainly a public function, but that is not the issue in the 
present matter. The only issue involved is the continuity of 
service and service conditions of employees of St. Gabriel’s 
Academy, a private minority institution. Neither the institution 
nor the posts held by the teachers are governed by any statutory 
obligation. Moreover, the burden of safeguarding such service 
conditions has been erroneously placed on the appellant. These 
service conditions are in clear contravention of those followed by 
all 137 schools run by the appellant society resulting in creating 
two sets of employees at the APS No. 2, Roorkee. A contract of 
purely personal service between the Respondents and their 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 12 of 91 
 
erstwhile employer, viz. St. Gabriels Academy cannot be executed 
against the appellant in a writ petition with whom there is no 
privity of contract.  
11. 
It was further pointed out that the appellants are running 
an Army Public School under the aegis of the Army Welfare 
Education Society which is a self-financing school managing all 
expenditures from the school fees. It was submitted that if the 
impugned order is allowed to operate and the arrangement made 
in the order dated 06.01.2016 which continued so far smoothly 
for 8 years is disturbed, the school will suffer irreparable loss 
and might have to be closed down. The demands of the 
respondents are outrageous which can be gauged from the fact 
that the respondents have claimed an amount of Rs. 5.10 crore 
in their Counter affidavit filed in 2021.   
12. 
 In the last, it was pointed out that all the respondents are 
currently employed at APS No. 2, Roorkee, and their status is on 
par with any other APS staff member. They are availing the same 
perks and emoluments available to any APS No 2, Roorkee 
employee. The basic pay as per the AWES Rules and Regulations 
was maintained for the teaching staff in accordance with the 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 13 of 91 
 
recommendations of the VI Pay Commission. Furthermore, for 
the members of the teaching staff, experience of more than 5 
years was accounted for with additional increments at 3% of 
Basic Pay for every block of three years of service or part thereof, 
as of April 2012. Subsequently, an annual increment of 3% of 
Basic Pay (as on March 31 of every financial year) was provided 
for every completed year. Dearness Allowance (DA), House Rent 
Allowance (HRA), and all other applicable allowances, including 
free education for the wards of staff, was considered as per the 
AWES Rules and Regulations, as prevailing in January 2016.  
The salary of office and Class IV staff was fixed as per the 
prevailing rules and seniority was catered to by additional 
increments at 10% of the annual increment for every three years 
of service. No employee came to be appointed after 2012 drawing 
a higher salary than the respondents. These staff members have 
been given even ten to twelve increments, a practice usually not 
followed in APS 2. 
13.  
In such circumstances referred to above, the learned 
counsel appearing for the appellant society submitted that there 
being merit in the appeals, those may be allowed by setting aside 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 14 of 91 
 
the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High 
Court. But at the same time, the interim order passed by this 
Court dated 15.02.2021 may be made absolute. 
D. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 
14. 
On the other hand, these appeals have been vehemently 
opposed by the learned senior counsel appearing for the 
respondent by submitting that the no error, not to speak of any 
error of law, could be said to have been committed by the High 
Court in passing the impugned judgment and order. Accordingly 
to the learned counsel, the appellant society is a “State” within 
Article 12 of the Constitution for the following reasons:- 
a) That, as per the amendments made to the 
Memorandum of Army Welfare Education Society, 
the address of the Army Welfare Education Society 
(AWES) is shown to be the Adjutant General’s 
Branch in the Integrated headquarters of the 
Ministry of Defence [MoD] (Army).   
b) Further, the Executive Committee and the Board 
of Governors i.e., the President, Vice President and 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 15 of 91 
 
the Secretaries are none other than the Lt. Generals, 
chief of the Army Staff, and General Officer 
commanding in-chief of the Eastern, Southern, 
Western and Northern commands. 
c) That, as per the Financial Management clause of 
the said Memorandum, “the corpus and grants for 
establishment of Army educational institution 
will be provided by the executive Committee 
from the welfare funds of the Adjutant General 
Branch, Army Headquarters.”  
d) AWES is a government run institution i.e., by the 
Ministry of Defence and hence, a State under Article 
12 of the Constitution of India.  
15. 
It was further submitted that the Army Public School-2, 
Roorkee, is affiliated with the CBSE and is governed by its norms. 
In other words, the AWES and its affiliate school - Army Public 
School-2, Roorkee are governed and regulated by statutory 
provisions. Assuming for the sake of arguments that the dispute 
is private in nature, the present case is still amenable to writ 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 16 of 91 
 
jurisdiction for the service conditions of the answering 
respondents are governed/regulated by statutory provisions.   
16. 
It was further argued that the CBSE Affiliation Bye-Laws 
Norm 3 (v) categorically provides that “The school in India 
must pay salaries and admissible allowances to the staff 
not less that the corresponding categories of employees in 
the State Government schools or as per scales etc. 
prescribed by the Government of India.” In fact, AWES 
publishes advertisement to fill up any vacancy in Army Public 
School as “Govt. Jobs” in Job’s category. It was submitted that 
considering the alliance between the appellant and St. Gabriel’s 
Academy Roorkee, the respondents were under a legitimate 
expectation that their conditions of service would not be changed 
to their disadvantage by the appellant.   
17.  
In such circumstances referred to above, the learned 
counsel appearing for the respondents prayed that there being 
no merit in the appeals, those may be dismissed and the 
impugned judgment and order passed by the learned single 
Judge as affirmed in appeal may be given effect to.

Page 17 of 91 
 
E. JUDGMENT PASSED BY THE LEARNED SINGLE JUDGE 
 
18. 
At this stage, we should also look into the judgment 
passed by the learned single judge of the High Court dated 
05.08.2014. The relevant findings recorded by the learned single 
Judge is as under:- 
“10. As we have seen, the school in question was 
earlier known as “St. Gabriel School” which was 
under the management of a Society, namely, 
respondent no.4 i.e. St. Gabriel Province of Delhi. Now 
the management has changed and is presently with 
respondent no.5/Bengal Sappers St. Gabriel’s 
Academy, Roorkee.   
11. According to the respondents, referred above, the 
establishment of school in an Army Unit or 
Regimental Center is a welfare activity which a Unit 
or Regimental Center undertakes for the welfare of its 
personnel and troops and this welfare work does not 
form apart of any official or statutory duty of the 
officers of the Army so engaged in the school activity 
and, therefore, the school activity including its 
administration is entirely a private enterprises 
undertaken by the officers and staff of the Indian 
Army for the welfare of their personnel and their 
dependents.   
12. The said respondents (Respondent Nos. 2, 3, 5, 7) 
further argue that in such a welfare activity, the 
Government or the Indian Army does not have any 
control or a role to play, leave aside any deep or 
pervasive control on the administration or running of 
the School, as is alleged by the petitioners. They also 
argue 
that 
the 
welfare 
activities 
which 
are 
undertaken are financed entirely by raising private 
funds, primarily from private contributions, by the 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 18 of 91 
 
officers and men of various military establishments. 
The fund is known as “Regimental Fund of the Unit” 
and is purely private in nature and non-auditable by 
Central Defence Accounts. The building furniture and 
equipments provided to respondent nos. 3/Bengal 
Engineering Group Benevolent Trust and earlier to 
respondent no.4/ Institute of Brothers of St. Gabriel 
is provided from the Regimental funds which is 
purely private property of Bengal Engineering Group 
Benevolent Trust. There is no Central Government 
control at all. It is further being argued that 
respondent nos. 1, 2 i.e. Union of India as well as the 
Bengal Engineering Group and Centre have been 
made parties in the writ petition with the sole purpose 
to make the matter amenable to the writ jurisdiction 
of this Court, under Article 226 of the Constitution of 
India, though respondent nos. 1 and 2 do not have 
any role to play in the present matter or dispute and 
for the remaining respondents who are presently in 
control of the affairs of the school a writ petition 
would not be maintainable.   
13. It has also been argued that the Commandant of 
Bengal Engineering Group and Centre, Roorkee is 
only 
the 
Ex-officio 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Bengal 
Engineering Group Benevolent Trust and the welfare 
activity conducted by the Trust are purely honorary 
having absolutely no relation to official charter of the 
duty of army officers and army persons. Respondent 
no.7 i.e. Army Welfare Education Society is again a 
private unaided 
Society registered under 
the 
Registration Act, hence does not come under the writ  
jurisdiction it does not have any grant from the 
Government of India, State Government 
and, 
therefore, not a State or its instrumentalities as 
defined in Article 12 of the Constitution of India. In 
order to substantiate this argument, learned counsel 
for the respondents Mr. Manoj Tiwari, Senior 
Advocate and Mr. Pullak Raj Mullick have relied upon 
a Division Bench judgment of Allahabad High Court, 
namely, Army School, Kunaraghat, Gorakhpur 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 19 of 91 
 
Vs. Smt. Shilpi Paul, 2004 (5) AWC 4934, where it 
was held that an Army school is purely a private body 
and not “State” under Article 12 of the Constitution of 
India, hence writ petition was not maintainable 
against it. Since it has been held that a writ petition 
is not maintainable against an Army school by a 
Division Bench judgment of Allahabad High Court the 
present writ petition is not maintainable, which is 
also against an Army School and is exactly on the 
same footing as the present school i.e. respondent no. 
5, which is now known as “Army School No.2”. In 
paragraph nos. 23, 25 and 26 of the above judgment 
the Division Bench of Allahabad High Court said as 
under:-  
“23. We have carefully considered these 
judgments as well as the other decisions 
relied on by the learned counsels for the 
parties. We have also considered the 
decision of the learned single judge of this 
Court in Abu Zaid v. Principal Madrasa-Tul-
Islah Sarai Mir, Azamgarh, Civil Misc. Writ 
Petition No. 14238 of 1998, decided on 
28.7.1998. In the decision of Abu Zaid v. 
Principal 
Madrasa-Tul-Islah 
Sarai 
Mir, 
Azamgarh (supra) the learned single Judge 
has held that a writ petition lies even against 
a private educational institution since the 
educational institution is discharging a 
public duty of imparting education which has 
been held to be a fundamental right by the 
Supreme Court. We do not agree. In our 
opinion every school cannot be regarded as 
State under Article 12 of the Constitution and 
a writ petition will not lie against a purely 
private educational institution not receiving 
funds from the Government or a Government 
agency as it cannot be deemed to be an 
instrumentality of the State.

25. We agree with the view taken by the 
learned single Judge in V.K. Walia v. 
Chairman, Army School Mathura Cannt. 
(supra) and we do not agree with the view 
taken by the learned single Judge in Smt. 
Rajni Sharma v. Union of India (supra) since 
we are of the opinion that the Army School, 
Gorakhpur, is not State under Article 12 of 
the Constitution as it does not receive funds 
from 
the 
Government 
nor 
does 
the 
Government have any control much less 
deep and pervasive control over it.   
26. A similar view was taken by a Division 
Bench of the Jammu and Kashmir High 
Court in Writ Petition No. 1415 of 1996, Mrs. 
Asha Khosa v. Chairman, Army Public 
School, decided on 17.2.1997, in which the 
Division Bench of that Court held that the 
writ petition was not maintainable as the 
Army Welfare Educational Society is not an 
instrumentality of the State under Article 12 
of the Constitution. Against the judgment of 
the Jammu and Kashmir High Court a 
Special Appeal No. 6482 of 1997 was filed 
before the Supreme Court which was 
dismissed on 31.3.1997. We fully agree with 
the view taken by the Jammu and Kashmir 
High Court in the aforesaid decision.”

25. During the discussions and negotiation before the 
transfer, the authorities with whom the management 
was to vest shortly have not made any definite 
commitment or given assurance to the teaching or the 
non teaching staff of the College regarding security of 
their tenure, or regarding status of their service. In 
fact the teaching and non teaching staff of the school 
were never taken into confidence either by the BEG & 
C or the St. Gabriel Society in their negotiations. When 
such agreement was executed and the baton was 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 21 of 91 
 
handed over to the new employer and management, 
the concern and interest of those who are under the 
employment ought to be addressed. These are the 
basic requirements when such change over takes 
place in a civil society, which is bound by the rule of 
law. The employees of the school have a legitimate 
expectation that their conditions of service which 
were applicable immediately before the change over 
will not be varied to their disadvantage. However, 
this is what the new employer intend to do, which is 
reflected in his letter dated 28.02.2012. The danger 
to their service is not a mere apprehension of the 14 
petitioners. It is a “clear and present” danger. This 
Court consequently intends to issue its writ of 
mandamus to stop the respondents from doing this.  
26. In the entire process of the change of 
management, the petitioners were never taken into 
confidence. Their point of view was never considered 
necessary. They were never given any opportunity of 
hearing. On the contrary BEG & C and respondent no. 
7 AWES, have shown documents before this Court 
justifying their unilateral action. Mr. P.R. Mullick, 
counsel for the respondent nos. 2 & 3 has argued that 
the society i.e. Brothers of St. Gabriel Province of 
Delhi have made immense profit from the school and 
they have opened another school in Roorkee and if 
they are really concerned about the petitioners then 
they can adjust them in their new school.  
27. This is not the correct way of dealing with the 
issue. What has happened is not a simple change 
over from one management to another, which can 
only be seen on the basis of “profit and loss accounts” 
and “balance sheets.” It is not a business commercial 
deal we are looking at. What we are looking at is a 
change over of management in a school which 
imparts education to school going children and 
therefore the “public element” in this transaction has 
always to be kept in mind.  

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 22 of 91 
 
28. We also have to appreciate the “legitimate 
expectations” of the petitioners who expect equity, 
fair-play and justice, from a public authority which 
respondent nos. 2, 3 and 7 indeed are and, therefore, 
they must meet such standards as a public authority 
ought to 15 have. The new management of the School, 
including respondent no.2, 3 and 7 are hereby 
directed not to change or vary the conditions of the 
petitioners to their disadvantage.  
29. The writ petition, consequently, succeeds. The 
order dated 28.02.2012, since it is only in the nature 
of letter, need not be quashed. All the same, a 
mandamus is hereby issued to the respondents not 
to change, vary or resent any of those conditions on 
which the petitioners (teaching as well as non 
teaching staff of the school) were appointed, to the 
disadvantage of the petitioners.”   
                                                (Emphasis supplied) 
  
19. 
Thus, the error is in para 27 when the learned single Judge 
says that since the school imparts education, the public element 
should be kept in mind. Undoubtedly, any institution imparting 
education discharges public duty and, therefore, public element 
may be involved. However, the learned single Judge overlooked 
the fact that the dispute between the school and the teachers 
and also the non-teaching staff is relating to their service 
conditions. In such circumstances, public element will not come 
into play.

F. APPEAL COURT JUDGMENT 
 
20. 
We should also look into the impugned judgment and 
order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court affirming 
the above referred judgment of the learned single Judge. The 
relevant findings are as under:- 
“16) The Parliament in its wisdom has enacted 
the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory 
Education Act, 2009, considering it as a fundamental 
right of children. The institution is affiliated to the 
Central Board of Secondary Education. The Central 
Government has accorded affiliation to the CBSE to 
impart education as per its syllabus. Thus, there is a 
discharge of public function of the institutions 
recognized and affiliated with CBSE. Though the 
learned Single Judge has recorded the reasons in 
holding that the writ petition is maintainable against 
the appellant but, at the cost of repetition, we deem it 
necessary to deal with the issue and after having 
considered the provisions of Article 12 and 226 of the 
Constitution of India and the catena of judgments, we 
are of considered opinion that the writ petition 
against the appellant was maintainable and has 
rightly been held maintainable by the learned Single 
Judge. 
17) Second issue before the learned Single Judge and 
this Court is - as to whether the cancellation of 
regular appointment of the teaching and non-teaching 
employees of the institution run by joint venture and 
giving the ad hoc appointment to the teachers is valid 
or not? The learned Single Judge on the pleadings of 
the parties and considering the fact that long back in 
the year 1967 created a joint venture for imparting 
the education and continued till 2012 and the 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 24 of 91 
 
appellant by unilateral action decided to break up the 
joint venture. The institute of brothers of St. Gabriel 
did not challenge their unilateral action, and 
departed quietly. 
18) Admittedly, the appellant herein has unilaterally 
changed the service conditions of the writ petitioners 
by way of letter dated 28.02.2012 (copy Annexure 6 
to the writ petition). A perusal of the pleadings of the 
rival parties would reveal that the appellant herein as 
well as the respondent Bengal Engineering Group 
and Center were not a party before learned Single 
Judge. The Deputy Commandant of the Bengal 
Engineering Group and Center is the de facto 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Bengal 
Engineering 
Group 
Benevolent Trust. The Union of India was also 
impleaded as a party respondent. The Commandant 
or the Deputy Commandant has no individual or 
personal 
capacity. 
Deputy 
Commandant 
has 
discharged his duties as de facto Chairman of the 
Bengal Engineering Group and Benevolent Trust 
(hereinafter referred to as Benevolent Trust). The 
Deputy Commandant has no independent power 
being an ex officio of the Benevolent Trust. The 
Deputy Commandant cannot work arbitrarily. Since 
the appellant and respondent Bengal Engineering 
Group Benevolent Trust were party and same relief 
was 
granted, 
the 
Bengal 
Engineering 
Group 
Benevolent Trust has not chosen to file the Special 
Appeal against the impugned judgment and order 
passed by learned Single Judge. It is true that the 
appellant being a Society has preferred this Special 
Appeal, but it was the decision of respondent no. 51 
to issue letter dated 28.02.2012 (copy Annexure 6 to 
the writ petition). The service conditions of the 
teaching staff and non-teaching staff, which were 
continuing before terminating the legality of Institute 
of Brothers of St. Gabriel and taking over the entire 
management of the Institution by the Bengal 
Engineering Group Benevolent Trust. The learned 
Single Judge has considered elaborately that the 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 25 of 91 
 
Benevolent Trust cannot change the service condition 
unilaterally and convert the regular services of the 
teaching and non-teaching staff and to issue ad hoc 
appointments to them. The appeal has been preferred 
by Army Welfare Education Society, whereof the 
institution was a joint venture of Brother of St. Gabrial 
and Bengal Engineering Group Benevolent Trust. The 
appellant may be an apex body (society) running the 
Army Schools throughout the country, but it cannot 
escape from the noble idea of creating Bengal 
Engineering Group Benevolent Trust for imparting 
education. Service benefits and status of the 
employee/employees could not be reduced without 
assigning sound reasons by the employer and 
without affording opportunity of hearing to them. We 
are also of the view that the services of the teaching 
and non- teaching staff cannot be changed from 
regular services to ad hoc services. 
19. We have noticed that the Bengal Engineering 
Group Benevolent Trust is the aggrieved party, but 
appeal has not been preferred by it. We are of the 
opinion that the appellants cannot be said to be 
aggrieved persons and appeal at their behest is not 
maintainable. 
20) The affairs of Bengal Engineering Group and 
Center come within the control of the Ministry of 
Defence, Union of India. Deputy Commandant has no 
authority to engage a private lawyer without the 
permission of Union of India. The purpose of granting 
permission to engage a private lawyer is also a 
serious issue, but for the reasons best reason to the 
officer concerned a private lawyer has been 
appointed by the appellant herein, which is 
discharging 
a 
public 
duty, 
to 
contest 
the 
aforementioned matters. Deputy Commandant of 
Bengal Engineering Group and Center holding a post 
in the Indian Army, which comes within the control of 
Ministry of Defence, Union of India ought not to have 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 26 of 91 
 
engaged a private lawyer without permission of the 
Union of India. 
21) We find no illegality, perversity or jurisdiction 
error in the impugned judgment passed by learned 
Single Judge dated 05.08.2012, allowing the writ 
petition, filed by the teaching and non- teaching staff 
of the Institution. Since the record of the writ petitions 
which were pending before the learned Single Judge 
were called by this Court considering the common 
question involved in the special appeals as well as in 
the writ petitions which were pending before the 
learned single judge, we are of the view that 
aforementioned special appeals are liable to be 
dismissed. The same are hereby dismissed. The writ 
petitions mentioned aforesaid are also disposed of 
accordingly as the relief sought in the writ petitions 
has already been adjudicated in the appeals.” 
 
G. ANALYSIS 
 
21. 
Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties 
and having gone through the materials on record, the only 
question that falls for our consideration is whether the High 
Court was justified in entertaining the writ petition filed by the 
respondents herein under Article 226 of the Constitution against 
the appellant society? 
22. 
From the materials on record, the following is discernible:- 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 27 of 91 
 
1) In 1962, the Commandant of Bengal Engineering Group and 
Centre (“BEGC”), by virtue of his position as ex officio 
Chairman of the Bengal Engineering Group Benevolent Trust 
(“BEGBT”) granted land to the Institute of Brothers of St 
Gabriel’s (“IBSG”), an unaided private minority society, for 
running a school.  
2) On 13.07.1967, the BEGBT executed a formal lease 
agreement with IBSG with respect to the land situated at 
Cantonment 
B-31, 
including 
the 
School 
Building, 
playground and Bungalow No.1, for the establishment of a 
Higher Secondary School under the Board of All India Higher 
Secondary School in Delhi, or any other similar Government 
Board. The school so formed was named as the Bengal 
Sappers St Gabriel’s Academy, Roorkee (“BSSGA”).  
3) On 29.04.1983, the Army Welfare Education Society was 
registered under the Societies Registration Act. 
4) On 20.04.1997, the BEGBT and IBSG respectively renewed 
the lease agreement dated 13.07.1967 for a further period of 
15 years i.e. up to 31.03.2012.  

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 28 of 91 
 
5) On 26.04.2010, the Chairman of BEGBT took a policy 
decision not to renew the lease agreement dated 20.04.1997.  
BEGBT, by its letter addressed to the Provincial Superior, 
IBSG, communicated that the lease would not be renewed 
beyond the stipulated period and requested IBSG to consider 
the letter as an advance notice and suitably apprise all the 
students and their parents so that they get adequate time to 
make alternate arrangements by 31.03.2012 i.e. when the 
lease was set to expire.  
6) On 15.05.2010, IBSG, by its letter addressed to the Deputy 
Commandant, BEGC, requested to furnish information as 
regards the non- renewal of the lease dated 20.04.1997.   
7) On 22.06.2010, BEGC, in its reply to IBSG’s letter dated 
15.05.2010, stated that there was a proposal under 
consideration to establish an Army School at the location 
that was leased to IBSG, and again requested IBSG to inform 
the Board and the parents about the said proposal. 
8) In July, 2021, BEGC initiated a proposal to establish an 
Army Public School under the aegis of Army Welfare 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 29 of 91 
 
Education Society (appellant) at the place that was then 
leased to IBSG.  
9) On 23.02.2012, the appellant society granted approval to 
establish Army Public School No.2 at Roorkee ("APS No.2"), 
on the land that was earlier leased to IBSG. The approval 
dated 23.02.2012 laid down the modalities for adjusting the 
existing staff at BSSGA into APS No.2, stating that-  
“(g) The process of selecting Principal and 
teachers must be completed by March 12 and 
they should be in position by 01 Apr 2012. 
Service of the teachers and administrative staff 
of St Gabriel's Academy School should be 
terminated before the establishment of APS No 2 
Roorkee. Existing competent teachers meeting 
the CBSE educational qualifications may be 
considered for appointment on ad-hoc basis for 
one year after a gap of minimum of seven days 
from the date of termination of service. The 
condition of holding an AWES Score Card for 
appointment as teachers may be relaxed their 
case. They should be advised to appear and 
qualify in All India Written Test scheduled on 
second Sunday of Dec 2012. The terms and 
conditions 
for 
their 
employment 
should 
accordingly be formulated.”  
 
10) On 28.02.2012, BEGC, by its letter to IBSG, communicated 
the conditions laid down in the approval letter dated 
23.02.2012. 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 30 of 91 
 
11) On 14.03.2012 the respondents herein filed Writ Petition 
No. 341 of 2012 before the High Court of Uttarakhand at 
Nainital seeking a direction to quash the letter dated 
28.02.2012 and also to direct the appellant society to 
continue their services on the same terms and conditions 
provided to them by the IBSG.  
12) It appears that the appellant society is a purely unaided 
private society established for the purpose of imparting 
education to the children of the army personnel including 
the widows and ex-servicemen.    
 
i. 
Position of Law 
 
23. 
We begin with the decision of this Court in Executive 
Committee of Vaish Degree College v. Lakshmi Narain, AIR 
1976 SC 888. This is one of the landmark decisions of this Court 
as this case discussed and considered all the previous decisions 
and the same has been referred to and relied upon by this Court 
till this date. This Court held that a contract of personal service 
cannot ordinarily be enforced specifically. Three exceptions were 
set out as well recognized : (1) Where a public servant is sought 
to be removed from service in contravention of the provisions 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 31 of 91 
 
of Article 311 of the Constitution of India; (2) Where a worker is 
sought to be reinstated under the Industrial Law; (3) Where a 
statutory body acts in breach or violation of the mandatory-
provisions of the statute. A statutory body was defined in that 
case as one which was created by or under a statute and owed 
its existence to a statute. It was held that an institution governed 
by certain statutory provisions for its proper maintenance and 
administration would not be a statutory body. The test 
prescribed was whether the institution would exist in the 
absence of a statute.  
24. 
In J. Tiwari v. Jawala Devi Vidya Mandir, (1979) 4 SCC 
160, it was held that the rights and obligations of an employee of 
a private institution are governed by the terms of the contract 
between the parties. It was also observed that the regulations of 
the University or the provisions of the Educational Code framed 
by the State Government may be applicable to the institution and 
if the provisions thereof are violated, the University may be 
entitled to disaffiliate the institution. But that would not, 
however, make that the institution a public or a statutory body.

25.  
In Dipak Kumar Biswas v. Director of Public 
Instruction, 1987 (2) SCC 252, the appellant before this Court 
instituted a suit for declaration that he continued to be in service 
in Lady Keane Girls College, Shillong and for an injunction. His 
services were terminated by the College on the ground that the 
Director of Public Instruction had not approved of his 
appointment. The trial court dismissed the suit. The first 
appellate court allowed the appeal of the plaintiff and granted a 
decree as prayed for. The High Court, while holding that there 
was no necessity for the approval by the Director of Public 
Instruction as the Assam College Management Rules were not 
adopted by the State of Meghalaya, held that reinstatement of 
the plaintiff in service was not possible as it could be granted 
only to persons belonging to the categories of (1) Government 
servants (2) Industrial workmen and (3) Employees of statutory 
bodies. Consequently, the High Court granted a decree for 
damages only. The aggrieved plaintiff took the matter on appeal 
to this Court. Following the view token in Vaish Degree College 
v. Lakshmi Narain (supra), this Court held that a contract of 
service could not be enforced specifically. Then the question to 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 33 of 91 
 
be considered was whether the college in that case which was 
admittedly receiving aid from the Government and was governed 
by the regulations of the University was a statutory body. The 
Court answered in the negative and rejected the claim for 
reinstatement. The Court observed as follows:- 
“The law enunciated in these decisions stand fully 
attracted to this case also. Even though the Lady 
Keane Girls College may be governed by the statutes 
of the University and the Education Code framed by 
the Government of Meghalaya and even though the 
college may be receiving financial aid from the 
Government it would not be a statutory body because 
it has not been created by any statute and its 
existence is not dependent upon any statutory 
provision. Ultimately the Supreme Court granted 
additional damages to the appellant.” 
 
26.  
In Tekraj v. Union of India, 1988 (1) SCC 236, the 
question was whether the Institute of Constitutional and 
Parliamentary 
studies 
registered 
under 
the Societies 
Registration Act, 1860 was a “State” within the meaning 
of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. After tracing the case 
law on the subject the Court observed as follows:- 
“Democracy pre-supposes certain conditions or its 
successful working. It is necessary that there must be 
a deep sense of understanding, mutual confidence 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 34 of 91 
 
and tolerance and regard and acceptance of the 
views of others. In the early years of freedom, the 
spirit of sacrifice and a sense of obligation to the 
leadership that had helped the dream of freedom to 
materialise had been accepted. The emergence of a 
new generation within less than two decades of 
independency gave rise to a feeling that the people's 
representatives in the legislatures required the 
acquisition of the appropriate democratic ideas and 
spirit. ICPS was born as a voluntary organisation to 
fulfil this requirement. At the inception it was 
certainly not a governmental organisation and it has 
not been the case of the parties in their pleadings nor 
have we been told at the bar during the long 
arguments that had been advanced that the objects 
of ICPS are those which are a State obligation to fulfil. 
The Society was thus born out of a feeling that there 
should be a voluntary association mostly consisting 
of members of the two Houses of Parliament with 
some external support to fulfil the objects which were 
adopted by the Society. The objects of the Society 
were not governmental business but were certainly 
the aspects which were expected to equip Members of 
Parliament and the State Legislatures with the 
requisite knowledge and experience for better 
functioning. Many of the objects adopted by the 
Society were not confined to the two Houses of 
Parliament and were intended to have an impact on 
society at large.   
The 
Memorandum 
of 
the 
Society 
permitted 
acceptance of gifts, donations and subscriptions. 
There is material to show that the Ford Foundation, a 
US based Trust, had extended support for sometime. 
Undoubtedly, the annual contribution from the 
Government has been substantial and it would not be 
 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 35 of 91 
 
wrong to say that they perhaps constitute the main 
source of funding, yet some money has been coming 
from other sources. In later years, foreign funding 
came to be regulated and, therefore it became 
necessary to provide that without Government 
clearance, like any other institution, ICPS was not to 
receive foreign donation. No material has been placed 
before us for the stand that the Society was not 
entitled to receive contributions from any indigenous 
source 
without 
Government 
sanction. 
Since 
Government moneys has been coming, the usual 
conditions attached to Government grants have been 
applied and enforced. If the Society's affairs were 
really intended to be carried on as part of the Lok 
Sabha or Parliament as such, the manner of 
functioning would have been different. The accounts 
of the Society are separately maintained and subject 
to audit in the same way as the affairs of societies 
receiving Government grants are to be audited. 
Government usually impose certain conditions and 
restrictions when grants are made. No exception has 
been made in respect of the Society and the mere fact 
that such restrictions are made is not a determinative 
aspect.  
Considerable attempt has been made by Mr. Rao, 
learned Counsel for the appellant, to show that in the 
functioning of the Society there is deep and pervasive 
control 
of 
Government. 
We 
have 
examined 
meticulously the correspondence and the instances 
where control was attempted to be exercised or has, 
as a fact, been exercised but these again are features 
which appear to have been explained away.”

27. 
In spite of the above facts and circumstances, this Court 
held that the institute was not a “State” or State instrumentality 
or other authority.  
28. 
If the Authority/Body can be treated as a “State” within 
the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India, then in 
such circumstances, it goes without saying that a writ petition 
under Article 226 would be maintainable against such an 
Authority/Body for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental 
and other legal rights. Therefore, the definition contained in 
Article 12 is for the purpose of application of the provisions 
contained in Part III. Article 226 of the Constitution, which deals 
with powers of the High Courts to issue certain writs, inter alia, 
stipulates that every High Court has the power to issue 
directions, orders or writs to any person or authority, including, 
in appropriate cases, any Government, for the enforcement of 
any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose. 
29. 
So far as Article 12 of the Constitution is concerned, the 
“State” includes “all local and other Authorities within the 
territory of India or under the control of the Government of 
India”.  The debate on the question as to which body would 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 37 of 91 
 
qualify as “other authority” & the test/principles applicable for 
ascertaining as to whether a particular body can be treated as 
“other authority” has been never ending. If such an authority 
violates the fundamental right or other legal rights of any person 
or citizen (as the case may be), a writ petition can be filed under 
Article 226 of the Constitution invoking the extraordinary 
jurisdiction of the High Court and seeking appropriate direction, 
order or writ. However, under Article 226 of the Constitution, the 
power of the High Court is not limited to the Government or 
authority which qualifies to be “State” under Article 12. Power is 
extended to issue directions, orders or writs “to any person or 
authority”. Again, this power of issuing directions, orders or writs 
is not limited to enforcement of fundamental rights conferred by 
Part III, but also “for any other purpose”. Thus, power of the High 
Court takes within its sweep more “authorities” than stipulated 
in Article 12 and the subject-matter which can be dealt with 
under this Article is also wider in scope. 
30. 
There are three decisions of this Court we must look into 
and discuss.

31. 
The first judgment is Shri Anadi Mukta Sadguru Shree 
Muktajee 
Vandasjiswami 
Suvarna 
Jayanti 
Mahotsav 
Smarak Trust & Ors. v. V. R. Rudani & Ors. reported in (1989) 
2 SCC 691 and the other two judgments, we are talking about 
are K. Krishnamacharyulu & Ors. v. Sri Venkateswara 
Hindu College of Engineering & Anr. reported in 1997 (3) SCC 
571 and Satimbla Sharma v. St. Paul’s Senior Secondary 
School, reported in (2011) 13 SCC 760. 
32. 
In Shri Anadi Mukta Sadguru (supra), dispute arose 
between the Trust which was managing and running science 
college and teachers of the said college. It pertained to payment 
of certain employment related benefits like basic pay, etc. The 
matter was referred to the Chancellor of Gujarat University for 
his decision. The Chancellor passed an award, which was 
accepted by the University as well as the State Government and 
a direction was issued to all affiliated colleges to pay their 
teachers in terms of the said award. However, the aforesaid Trust 
running the science college did not implement the award. 
Teachers filed the writ petition seeking mandamus and direction 
to the Trust to pay them their dues of salary, allowances, 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 39 of 91 
 
provident fund and gratuity in accordance therewith. It is in this 
context an issue arose as to whether the writ petition under 
Article 226 of the Constitution was maintainable against the said 
Trust which was admittedly not a statutory body or authority 
under Article 12 of the Constitution as it was a private Trust 
running an educational institution. The High Court held that the 
writ petition was maintainable and the said view was upheld by 
this Court in the aforesaid judgment. The discussion which is 
relevant for our purposes is contained in paras 14 to 19. 
However, we would like to reproduce paras 14, 16 and 19, which 
read as under:-  
“14. If the rights are purely of a private character no 
mandamus can issue. If the management of the 
college is purely a private body with no public duty 
mandamus will not lie. These are two exceptions to 
mandamus. But once these are absent and when the 
party has no other equally convenient remedy, 
mandamus cannot be denied. It has to be appreciated 
that the appellant Trust was managing the affiliated 
college to which public money is paid as government 
aid. Public money paid as government aid plays a 
major role in the control, maintenance and working of 
educational institutions. The aided institutions like 
government institutions discharge public function by 
way of imparting education to students. They are 
subject to the rules and regulations of the affiliating 
university. Their activities are closely supervised by 
the University authorities. Employment in such 
institutions, therefore, is not devoid of any public 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 40 of 91 
 
character. [ See The Evolving Indian Administrative 
Law by M.P. Jain (1983) p. 266.] So are the service 
conditions of the academic staff. When the University 
takes a decision regarding their pay scales, it will be 
binding on the management. The service conditions of 
the academic staff are, therefore, not purely of a 
private character. It has super-added protection by 
University decisions creating a legal right-duty 
relationship between the staff and the management. 
When there is existence of this relationship, 
mandamus cannot be refused to the aggrieved party. 
 
xxx 
 
 
 
xxx

16. 
There, 
however, 
the 
prerogative 
writ 
of 
mandamus is confined only to public authorities to 
compel performance of public duty. The ‘public 
authority’ for them means everybody which is 
created by statute—and whose powers and duties 
are defined by statute. So government departments, 
local authorities, police authorities, and statutory 
undertakings and corporations, are all ‘public 
authorities’. But there is no such limitation for our 
High Courts to issue the writ ‘in the nature of 
mandamus’. Article 226 confers wide powers on the 
High Courts to issue writs in the nature of prerogative 
writs. This is a striking departure from the English 
law. Under Article 226, writs can be issued to ‘any 
person or authority’. It can be issued ‘for the 
enforcement of any of the fundamental rights and for 
any other purpose’. 
 
xxx 
 
 
 
xxx  
 
xxx 
 
19. The term ‘authority’ used in Article 226, in the 
context, must receive a liberal meaning like the term 
in Article 12. Article 12 is relevant only for the 
purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights under 
Article 32. Article 226 confers power on the High 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 41 of 91 
 
Courts to issue writs for enforcement of the 
fundamental rights as well as non-fundamental 
rights. The words ‘any person or authority’ used in 
Article 226 are, therefore, not to be confined only to 
statutory authorities and instrumentalities of the 
State. They may cover any other person or body 
performing public duty. The form of the body 
concerned is not very much relevant. What is relevant 
is the nature of the duty imposed on the body. The 
duty must be judged in the light of positive obligation 
owed by the person or authority to the affected party. 
No matter by what means the duty is imposed. If a 
positive obligation exists mandamus cannot be 
denied.”  
 
        
    (Emphasis supplied) 
 
33.  
In para 14, the Court spelled out two exceptions to the writ 
of mandamus viz. (i) if the rights are purely of a private character, 
no mandamus can issue; and (ii) if the management of the college 
is purely a private body “with no public duty”, mandamus will 
not lie. The Court clarified that since the Trust in the said case 
was an aided institution, because of this reason, it discharges 
public function, like government institution, by way of imparting 
education to students, more particularly when rules and 
regulations of the affiliating university are applicable to such an 
institution, being an aided institution. In such a situation, the 
Court held that the service conditions of academic staff were not 
purely of a private character as the staff had super-added 
protection by university's decision creating a legal right and duty 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 42 of 91 
 
relationship between the staff and the management. Further, the 
Court explained in para 19 that the term “authority” used in 
Article 226, in the context, would receive a liberal meaning unlike 
the term in Article 12, inasmuch as Article 12 was relevant only 
for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights under 
Article 32, whereas Article 226 confers power on the High Courts 
to issue writs not only for enforcement of fundamental rights but 
also non-fundamental rights. What is relevant is the dicta of the 
Court that the term “authority” appearing in Article 226 of the 
Constitution would cover any other person or body performing 
public duty. The guiding factor, therefore, is the nature of duty 
imposed on such a body, namely, public duty to make it exigible 
to Article 226. 
34. 
In K. Krishnamacharyulu (supra), this Court again 
emphasised that where there is an interest created by the 
Government in an institution to impart education, which is a 
fundamental right of the citizens, the teachers who impart the 
education get an element of public interest in performance of 
their duties. In such a situation, remedy provided under Article 
226 would be available to the teachers.  

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 43 of 91 
 
35.  
However, both the decisions referred to above pertain to   
educational institutions and in the said cases, the function of 
imparting education was treated as the performance of the public 
duty, that too by those bodies where, the aided institutions were 
discharging the said functions like Government institutions and 
the interest was created by the Government in such institutions 
to impart education. 
36. 
In Satimbla Sharma (supra), the school therein was 
initially established as a mission school by the respondent No. 2.  
The school adopted the 10+2 system in 1993 and got affiliated to 
the Himachal Pradesh Board of School Education.  Before 
independence in 1947, the school was receiving grant-in-aid 
from the British Indian Government and thereafter from the 
Government of India up to 1950. Between 1951 and 1966, the 
school received grant-in-aid from the State Government of 
Punjab. After the State of Himachal Pradesh was formed, the 
school received grant-in-aid from the Government of Himachal 
Pradesh for the period between 1967 and 1976. From the year 
1977-1978, the Government of Himachal Pradesh stopped the 
grant-in-aid.  In such circumstances, the teachers of the school 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 44 of 91 
 
were paid less than the teachers of the Government schools and 
the Government-aided schools in the State of Himachal Pradesh. 
This led to filing of a writ petition in the High Court of Himachal 
Pradesh seeking a direction to pay the salary and allowances at 
par with the teachers of Government schools and the 
Government-aided schools. A learned single Judge of the High 
Court allowed the writ petition and directed the respondents 
therein to pay to the writ petitioners therein salary and 
allowances at par with their counterparts working in the 
Government schools from the dates they were entitled to and at 
the rates admissible from time to time.   The respondent Nos. 1 
and 2 therein preferred letters patent appeal before the Division 
Bench of the High Court. The appeal came to be allowed and the 
writ petition filed by the teachers was dismissed. In such 
circumstances referred to above, the litigation travelled to this 
Court. This Court, while disposing of the appeal, held as under:- 
“25. Where a statutory provision casts a duty on a private 
unaided school to pay the same salary and allowances to 
its teachers as are being paid to teachers of government-
aided schools, then a writ of mandamus to the school 
could be issued to enforce such statutory duty. But in the 
present case, there was no statutory provision requiring a 
private unaided school to pay to its teachers the same 
salary and allowances as were payable to teachers of 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 45 of 91 
 
government schools and therefore a mandamus could not 
be issued to pay to the teachers of private recognised 
unaided schools the same salary and allowances as were 
payable to teachers of government institutions. 
26. In K. Krishnamacharyulu v. Sri Venkateswara Hindu 
College of Engg., (1997) 3 SCC 571 : 1997 SCC (L&S) 841, 
relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants, 
executive instructions were issued by the Government 
that the scales of pay of Laboratory Assistants as non-
teaching staff of private colleges shall be on a par with 
the government employees and this Court held that even 
though there were no statutory rules, the Laboratory 
Assistants as non-teaching staff of private college were 
entitled to the parity of the pay scales as per the executive 
instructions of the Government and the writ jurisdiction of 
the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution is 
wide enough to issue a writ for payment of pay on a par 
with government employees. In the present case, there 
are no executive instructions issued by the Government 
requiring private schools to pay the same salary and 
allowances to their teachers as are being paid to teachers 
of government schools or government-aided schools. 
27. We cannot also issue a mandamus to Respondents 1 
and 2 on the ground that the conditions of provisional 
affiliation of schools prescribed by the Council for the 
Indian School Certificate Examinations stipulate in 
Clause (5)(b) that the salary and allowances and other 
benefits of the staff of the affiliated school must be 
comparable to that prescribed by the State Department of 
Education because such conditions for provisional 
affiliation are not statutory provisions or executive 
instructions, which are enforceable in law. Similarly, we 
cannot issue a mandamus to give effect to the 
recommendations of the Report of Education Commission 
1964-1966 that the scales of pay of school teachers 
belonging to the same category but working under 
different managements such as Government, local bodies 
or private managements should be the same, unless the 
recommendations are incorporated in an executive 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 46 of 91 
 
instruction or a statutory provision. We, therefore, affirm 
the impugned judgment of the Division Bench of the High 
Court. 
28. We, however, find that the 2009 Act has provisions in 
Section 23 regarding the qualifications for appointment 
and terms and conditions of service of teachers and sub-
section (3) of Section 23 of the 2009 Act provides that the 
salary and allowances payable to, and the terms and 
conditions of service of, teachers shall be such as may be 
prescribed. Section 38 of the 2009 Act empowers the 
appropriate Government to make rules and Section 
38(2)(l) of the 2009 Act provides that the appropriate 
Government, in particular, may make rules prescribing 
the salary and allowances payable to, and the terms and 
conditions of service of teachers, under sub-section (3) of 
Section 23. Section 2(a) defines “appropriate Government” 
as the State Government within whose territory the school 
is established. 
29. The State of Himachal Pradesh, Respondent 3 in this 
appeal, is thus empowered to make rules under sub-
section (3) of Section 23 read with Section 38(2)(l) of the 
2009 Act prescribing the salary and allowances payable 
to, and the terms and conditions of service of, teachers. 
Article 39(d) of the Constitution provides that the State 
shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing that 
there is equal pay for equal work for both men and 
women. Respondent 3 should therefore consider making 
rules under Section 23 read with Section 38(2)(l) of the 
2009 Act prescribing the salary and allowances of 
teachers keeping in mind Article 39(d) of the Constitution 
as early as possible.”                      (Emphasis supplied) 
 
37. 
Thus, the dictum as laid in Satimbla Sharma (supra) is 
clear. In the absence of any statutory provisions requiring a 
private unaided school to pay to its teachers the same salary and 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 47 of 91 
 
allowances as payable to the teachers of the Government schools, 
a mandamus cannot be issued to pay to the teachers of private 
recognised unaided schools the same salary and allowances as 
payable to the teachers of Government institutions. In the case 
at hand, the respondents are being paid the same salary and 
allowances as being paid to the teachers and non-teaching staff 
appointed by the appellant society. 
38. 
In one of the recent pronouncements of this Court in the 
case of St. Mary’s Education Society & Anr. v. Rajendra 
Prasad Bhargava & Ors. reported in (2023) 4 SCC 498, to 
which one of us (J.B. Pardiwala, J.) was a member, the entire law 
on the subject has been discussed threadbare. In the said case, 
this Court held that while a private unaided minority institution 
might be touching the spheres of public function by performing 
a public duty, its employees have no right of invoking the writ 
jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the 
Constitution in respect of matters relating to service where they 
are not governed or controlled by the statutory provision.   
39.  
In the said case, the following two questions fell for the 
consideration of the Court:- 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 48 of 91 
 
(a) Whether a writ petition under Article 226 of the 
Constitution of India is maintainable against a 
private unaided minority institution? 
(b) Whether a service dispute in the private realm 
involving a private educational institution and its 
employee can be adjudicated in a writ petition filed 
under Article 226 of the Constitution? In other 
words, even if a body performing public duty is 
amenable to writ jurisdiction, are all its decisions 
subject to judicial review or only those decisions 
which have public element therein can be judicially 
reviewed under the writ jurisdiction? 
40. 
This Court ultimately held as under:- 
“29. Respondent 1 herein has laid much emphasis on 
the fact that at the time of his appointment in the 
school, the same was affiliated to the Madhya 
Pradesh State Board. It is his case that at the relevant 
point of time the school used to receive the grant-in-
aid from the State Government of Madhya Pradesh. 
Later in point of time, the school came to be affiliated 
to CBSE. The argument of Respondent 1 seems to be 
that as the school is affiliated to the Central Board i.e. 
CBSE, it falls within the ambit of “State” under Article 
12 of the Constitution. The school is affiliated to CBSE 
for the purpose of imparting elementary education 
under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory 
Education Act, 2009 (for short “the 2009 Act”). As 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 49 of 91 
 
Appellant 1 is engaged in imparting of education, it 
could be said to be performing public functions. To put 
it in other words, Appellant 1 could be said to be 
performing public duty. Even if a body performing 
public duty is amenable to the writ jurisdiction, all its 
decisions are not subject to judicial review. Only 
those decisions which have public element therein 
can be judicially reviewed under the writ jurisdiction. 
If the action challenged does not have the public 
element, a writ of mandamus cannot be issued as the 
action could be said to be essentially of a private 
character. 
 
30. We may at the outset state that CBSE is only a 
society registered under the Societies Registration 
Act, 1860 and the school affiliated to it is not a 
creature of the statute and hence not a statutory 
body. The distinction between a body created by the 
statute and a body governed in accordance with a 
statute 
has 
been 
explained 
by 
this 
Court 
in Executive 
Committee 
of 
Vaish 
Degree 
College v. Lakshmi Narain, (1976) 2 SCC 58, as 
follows:- (SCC p. 65, para 10) 
 
“10. … It is, therefore, clear that there is a 
well marked distinction between a body 
which is created by the statute and a body 
which after having come into existence is 
governed in accordance with the provisions 
of the statute. In other words the position 
seems to be that the institution concerned 
must owe its very existence to a statute 
which would be the fountainhead of its 
powers. The question in such cases to be 
asked is, if there is no statute would the 
institution have any legal existence. If the 
answer is in the negative, then undoubtedly 
it is a statutory body, but if the institution 
has a separate existence of its own without 
any reference to the statute concerned but is 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 50 of 91 
 
merely governed by the statutory provisions 
it cannot be said to be a statutory body.” 
 
31.     As stated above, the school is affiliated to CBSE 
for the sake of convenience, namely, for the purpose 
of recognition and syllabus or the courses of study 
and the provisions of the 2009 Act and the Rules 
framed thereunder. 
32. 
The contention canvassed by Respondent 1 is 
that a writ petition is maintainable against the 
Committee of Management controlling the affairs of 
an institution (minority) run by it, if it violates any 
rules and bye-laws laid down by CBSE. First, as 
discussed above, CBSE itself is not a statutory body 
nor the regulations framed by it have any statutory 
force. Secondly, the mere fact that the Board grants 
recognition to the institutions on certain terms and 
conditions itself does not confer any enforceable right 
on any person as against the Committee of 
Management. 
33. In Regina v. St. Aloysius Higher Secondary 
School,  (1972) 4 SCC 188 : AIR 1971 SC 1920, this 
Court held that the mere fact that an institution is 
recognised by an authority, does not itself create an 
enforceable right to an aggrieved party against the 
Management by a teacher on the ground of breach or 
non-compliance of any of the Rules which was part of 
terms of the recognition. It was observed as under:- 
 
“24. … The Rules thus govern the terms on 
which 
the 
Government 
would 
grant 
recognition and aid and the Government can 
enforce these rules upon the management. 
But the enforcement of such rules is a matter 
between 
the 
Government 
and 
the 
management, and a third party, such as 
teacher aggrieved by some order of the 
management cannot derive from the rules 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 51 of 91 
 
any 
enforceable 
right 
against 
the 
management on the ground of breach or non-
compliance of any of the rules.” 
 
34. In Anita Verma v. D.A.V. College Management 
Committee, Unchahar, Rai Bareilly, (1992) 1 
UPLBEC 30:- 
 
“… 30. Where the services of a teacher were 
terminated, the Court held that the writ 
petition under Article 226 is not maintainable 
as the institution cannot be treated as the 
instrumentality of the State. The matter was 
considered 
in 
detail 
in Harbans 
Kaur v. Guru 
Tegh 
Bahadur 
Public 
School [Harbans 
Kaur v. Guru 
Tegh 
Bahadur Public School, 1992 SCC OnLine All 
444 : 1992 Lab IC 2070], wherein the 
services of the petitioner were terminated by 
the Managing Committee of the institution 
recognised by CBSE. It was held that the 
Affiliation Bye-laws framed by CBSE have 
no statutory force. The Court under Article 
226 of the Constitution of India can enforce 
compliance of statutory provision against a 
committee of management as held in a Full 
Bench decision of this Court in Aley Ahmad 
Abidi v. District Inspector of Schools [Aley 
Ahmad Abidi v. District Inspector of Schools, 
1976 SCC OnLine All 325 : AIR 1977 All 
539]. The Affiliation Bye-laws of CBSE 
having no statutory force, the only remedy 
against the aggrieved person is to approach 
CBSE putting his grievances in relation to the 
violation of the Affiliation Bye-laws by the 
institution.” 
 
35. Thus, where a teacher or non-teaching staff 
challenges the action of Committee of Management 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 52 of 91 
 
that it has violated the terms of contract or the rules 
of the Affiliation Bye-laws, the appropriate remedy of 
such teacher or employee is to approach CBSE or to 
take such other legal remedy available under law. It 
is open to CBSE to take appropriate action against the 
Committee of Management of the institution for 
withdrawal of recognition in case it finds that the 
Committee of Management has not performed its 
duties in accordance with the Affiliation Byelaws. 
 
36. It needs no elaboration to state that a school 
affiliated to CBSE which is unaided is not a State 
within Article 12 of the Constitution of India 
[see Satimbla 
Sharma v. St 
Paul's 
Senior 
Secondary School, (2011) 13 SCC 760 : (2012) 2 
SCC (L&S) 75 . Nevertheless the school discharges a 
public duty of imparting education which is a 
fundamental 
right 
of 
the 
citizen 
[see K. 
Krishnamacharyulu v. Sri Venkateswara Hindu 
College of Engineering, (1997) 3 SCC 571 : 1997 
SCC (L&S) 841. The school affiliated to CBSE is 
therefore an “authority” amenable to the jurisdiction 
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India 
[see Binny Ltd. v. V. Sadasivan, (2005) 6 SCC 657 
: 2005 SCC (L&S) 881] ]. However, a judicial review 
of the action challenged by a party can be had by 
resort to the writ jurisdiction only if there is a public 
law element and not to enforce a contract of personal 
service. A contract of personal service includes all 
matters relating to the service of the employee — 
confirmation, suspension, transfer, termination, etc. 
[see Apollo Tyres Ltd. v. C.P. Sebastian, (2009) 14 
SCC 360]. 
 
37. This Court in K.K. Saksena v. International 
Commission on Irrigation & Drainage, (2015) 4 
SCC 670, after an exhaustive review of its earlier 
decisions on the subject, held as follows:- (SCC pp. 
692 & 696, paras 43 & 52) 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 53 of 91 
 
 
“43. What follows from a minute and careful 
reading of the aforesaid judgments of this 
Court is that if a person or authority is 
“State” within the meaning of Article 12 of 
the Constitution, admittedly a writ petition 
under Article 226 would lie against such a 
person or body. However, we may add that 
even in such cases writ would not lie to 
enforce private law rights. There are a 
catena of judgments on this aspect and it is 
not necessary to refer to those judgments as 
that is the basic principle of judicial review of 
an action under the administrative law. The 
reason is obvious. A private law is that part 
of a legal system which is a part of common 
law that involves relationships between 
individuals, such as law of contract or torts. 
Therefore, even if writ petition would be 
maintainable against an authority, which is 
“State” under Article 12 of the Constitution, 
before issuing any writ, particularly writ of 
mandamus, the Court has to satisfy that 
action of such an authority, which is 
challenged, is in the domain of public law as 
distinguished from private law.

cannot 
be 
enforced. 
There 
are 
three 
exceptions to this rule, namely:  
(i) when the employee is a public servant 
working under the Union of India or State; 
(ii) when such an employee is employed by 
an authority/body which is a State within 
the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution 
of India; and

Page 54 of 91 
 
(iii) when such an employee is “workmen” 
within the meaning of Section 2(s) of the 
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and raises a 
dispute 
regarding 
his 
termination 
by 
invoking the machinery under the said Act. 
 
In the first two cases, the employment 
ceases to have private law character and 
“status” to such an employment is attached. 
In the third category of cases, it is the 
Industrial Disputes Act which confers 
jurisdiction on the Labour Court/Industrial 
Tribunal to grant reinstatement in case 
termination is found to be illegal.”

39. 
This 
Court 
in Janet 
Jeyapaul v. SRM 
University  (2015) 16 SCC 530, held that when a 
private body exercises its public functions even if it is 
not a State, the aggrieved person has a remedy, not 
only under the ordinary law, but also by way of a writ 
petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. 
In Binny Ltd. (supra), this Court held that Article 226 
of the Constitution is couched in such a way that a 
writ of mandamus could be issued even against a 
private authority. However, such private authority 
must be discharging a public function and that the 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 55 of 91 
 
decision sought to be corrected or enforced must be in 
the discharge of public function. 
 
40. Paragraph 11 of the judgment in Binny  Ltd. 
(supra) is reproduced below:- (SCC pp. 665-66) 
 
“11. Judicial review is designed to prevent the 
cases of abuse of power and neglect of duty by 
public 
authorities. 
However, 
under 
our 
Constitution, Article 226 is couched in such a 
way that a writ of mandamus could be issued 
even against a private authority. However, 
such private authority must be discharging a 
public function and that the decision sought to 
be corrected or enforced must be in discharge 
of a public function. The role of the State 
expanded enormously and attempts have been 
made to create various agencies to perform the 
governmental functions. Several corporations 
and companies have also been formed by the 
Government to run industries and to carry on 
trading activities. These have come to be 
known 
as 
public 
sector 
undertakings. 
However, in the interpretation given to Article 
12 of the Constitution, this Court took the view 
that 
many 
of 
these 
companies 
and 
corporations could come within the sweep of 
Article 12 of the Constitution. At the same time, 
there are private bodies also which may be 
discharging public functions. It is difficult to 
draw a line between public functions and 
private functions when it is being discharged 
by a purely private authority. A body is 
performing a “public function” when it seeks to 
achieve some collective benefit for the public or 
a section of the public and is accepted by the 
public or that section of the public as having 
authority to do so. Bodies therefore exercise 
public functions when they intervene or 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 56 of 91 
 
participate in social or economic affairs in the 
public interest.”                (Emphasis supplied) 
 
41. This Court considered various of its other 
decisions to examine the question of public law 
remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution. This 
Court observed in Binny Ltd. (supra) as under:- 
(SCC p. 673, para 29) 
 
“29. Thus, it can be seen that a writ of 
mandamus or the remedy under Article 226 
is pre-eminently a public law remedy and is 
not generally available as a remedy against 
private wrongs. It is used for enforcement of 
various rights of the public or to compel the 
public/statutory authorities to discharge 
their duties and to act within their bounds. It 
may be used to do justice when there is 
wrongful exercise of power or a refusal to 
perform duties. This writ is admirably 
equipped to serve as a judicial control over 
administrative actions. This writ could also 
be issued against any private body or 
person, specially in view of the words used 
in Article 226 of the Constitution. However, 
the scope of mandamus is limited to 
enforcement of public duty. The scope of 
mandamus is determined by the nature of 
the duty to be enforced, rather than the 
identity of the authority against whom it is 
sought. If the private body is discharging a 
public function and the denial of any right is 
in connection with the public duty imposed 
on such body, the public law remedy can be 
enforced. The duty cast on the public body 
may be either statutory or otherwise and the 
source of such power is immaterial, but, 
nevertheless, there must be the public law 
element in such action. Sometimes, it is 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 57 of 91 
 
difficult to distinguish between public law 
and private law remedies.” 
                                      (Emphasis supplied) 
 
42. In the penultimate paragraph, this Court ruled as 
under:-  (Binny case, SCC p. 674, para 32) 
 
“32. Applying these principles, it can very 
well be said that a writ of mandamus can be 
issued against a private body which is not 
“State” within the meaning of Article 12 of 
the Constitution and such body is amenable 
to the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the 
Constitution and the High Court under Article 
226 of the Constitution can exercise judicial 
review of the action challenged by a 
party. But there must be a public law 
element and it cannot be exercised to enforce 
purely 
private 
contracts 
entered 
into 
between the parties.”     (Emphasis supplied) 
 
43. In the background of the above legal position, it 
can be safely concluded that power of judicial review 
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India can be 
exercised by the High Court even if the body against 
which an action is sought is not State or an authority 
or an instrumentality of the State but there must be 
a public element in the action complained of. 
 
44. A reading of the above extract shows that the 
decision sought to be corrected or enforced must be 
in the discharge of a public function. No doubt, the 
aims and objective of Appellant 1 herein are to impart 
education, which is a public function. However, the 
issue herein is with regard to the termination of 
service of Respondent 1, which is basically a service 
contract. A body is said to be performing a public 
function when it seeks to achieve some collective 
benefit for the public or a section of the public and is 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 58 of 91 
 
accepted by the public or that section of the public as 
having authority to do so. 
 
45. In the case of Committee of Management, 
Delhi Public School v. M.K. Gandhi , reported in 
(2015) 17 SCC 353, this Court held that no writ is 
maintainable against a private school as it is not a 
“State” within the meaning of Article 12 of the 
Constitution of India.  
 
46. In Trigun Chand Thakur v. State of Bihar , 
reported in (2019) 7 SCC 513, this Court upheld the 
view   of a Division Bench of the Patna High Court 
which held that a teacher of privately managed 
school, even though financially aided by the State 
Government or the Board, cannot maintain a writ 
petition against an order of termination from service 
passed by the Management. 
 
47. In Satimbla Sharma (supra), this Court held 
that the unaided private minority schools over which 
the Government has no administrative control 
because of their autonomy under Article 30(1) of the 
Constitution are not “State” within the meaning of 
Article 12 of the Constitution. As the right to equality 
under Article 14 of the Constitution is available 
against the State, it cannot be claimed against 
unaided private minority private schools.  
 
48. The Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court 
in Roychan Abraham v. State of U.P., AIR 2019 
All 96, after taking into consideration various 
decisions of this Court, held as under:- 
 
“38. Even if it be assumed that an 
educational institution is imparting public 
duty, the act complained of must have direct 
nexus with the discharge of public duty. It is 
undisputedly a public law action which 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 59 of 91 
 
confers a right upon the aggrieved to invoke 
extraordinary writ jurisdiction under Article 
226 
for 
a 
prerogative 
writ. Individual 
wrongs or breach of mutual contracts 
without having any public element as its 
integral part cannot be rectified through 
petition under Article 226. Wherever Courts 
have intervened in exercise of jurisdiction 
under Article 226, 
either 
the 
service 
conditions were regulated by statutory 
provisions or the employer had the status of 
“State” within the expansive definition 
under Article 12 or it was found that the 
action complained of has public law 
element.” 
 
     (Emphasis supplied) 
 
49. We may refer to and rely upon one order passed 
by this Court in S.K. Varshney v. Principal, Our 
Lady of Fatima Higher Secondary School, (2023) 
4 SCC 539, in the Civil Appeal No. 8783-8784 of 2003 
dated July 19, 2007, in which the dispute was one 
relating to the retirement age of a teacher working in 
an unaided institution. This Court, while dismissing 
the appeal preferred by the employee, held as under:- 
 
  
“4. Both the petitions were dismissed by 
the learned Single Judge on the ground that 
no writ would lie against unaided private 
institutions and the writ petitions were not 
maintainable. 
  
5. Aggrieved thereby, writ appeals have 
been filed before the Division Bench without 
any result. The Division Bench held [S.K. 
Varshney v. Our Lady of Fatima Higher 
Secondary School, 1999 SCC OnLine All 908] 
that the writ petitions are not maintainable 
against 
a 
private 
institute. 
Aggrieved 
thereby, these appeals have been filed.

   6. The counsel for the appellant relied on 
a decision rendered by this Court in K. 
Krishnamacharyulu v. Sri 
Venkateswara 
Hindu College of Engg., (1997) 3 SCC 571. 
He particularly relied on the observation 
made by this Court in para 4 of the order that 
when an element of public interest is created 
and the institution is catering to that element, 
the teacher, being the arm of the institution, 
is also entitled to avail of the remedy 
provided under Article 226.  
 
  
7. 
This 
Court 
in Sushmita 
Basu v. Ballygunge Siksha Samity, (2006) 7 
SCC 680 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 1741] in which 
one of us (Sema, J.) is a party, after 
considering the aforesaid judgment has 
distinguished the ratio by holding that the 
writ under Article 226 of the Constitution 
against a private educational institute would 
be justified only if a public law element is 
involved and if it is only a private law 
remedy no writ petition would lie. In the 
present cases, there is no question of public 
law element involved inasmuch as the 
grievances of the appellants are of personal 
nature.  
 
  
8. We, accordingly, hold that writ 
petitions are not maintainable against the 
private institute. There is no infirmity in the 
order passed by the learned Single Judge 
and affirmed by the Division Bench. These 
appeals are devoid of merit and are, 
accordingly, dismissed. No costs.”    
                                      (Emphasis supplied) 
 
50. We may also refer to and rely upon the decision 
of this Court in Vidya Ram Misra v. Shri Jai

Narain College, (1972) 1 SCC 623 : AIR 1972 SC 
1450. The appellant therein filed a writ petition before 
the Lucknow Bench of the High Court of Allahabad 
challenging the validity of a resolution passed by the 
Managing Committee of Shri Jai Narain College, 
Lucknow, 
an 
associated 
college 
of 
Lucknow 
University, terminating his services and praying for 
issue of an appropriate writ or order quashing the 
resolution. A learned Single Judge of the High Court 
finding that in terminating the services, the Managing 
Committee acted in violation of the principles of 
natural justice, quashed the resolution and allowed 
the writ petition. The Managing Committee appealed 
against the order. A Division Bench of the High Court 
found that the relationship between the college and 
the appellant therein was that of master and servant 
and that even if the service of the appellant had been 
terminated in breach of the audi alteram partem rule 
of natural justice, the remedy of the appellant was to 
file a suit for damages and not to apply under Article 
226 of the Constitution for a writ or order in the nature 
of certiorari and that, in fact, no principle of natural 
justice was violated by terminating the services of the 
appellant. The writ petition was dismissed. In appeal, 
this Court upheld the decision of the High Court 
holding that the lecturer cannot have any cause of 
action on breach of the law but only on breach of the 
contract, hence he has a remedy only by way of suit 
for damages and not by way of writ under Article 226 
of the Constitution.  
 
51. In Vidya Ram Misra (supra), this Court observed 
thus:- (SCC p. 629, paras 12-13) 
 
“12. 
Whereas 
in P.R.K. 
Jodh v. A.L. 
Pande,  (1965) 2 SCR 713] , the terms and 
conditions of service embodies in Clause 
8(vi)(a) of the “College Code” had the force of 
law apart from the contract and conferred 
rights on the appellant there, here the terms 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 62 of 91 
 
and conditions mentioned in Statute 151 
have 
no 
efficacy, 
unless 
they 
are 
incorporated 
in 
a 
contract. 
Therefore, 
appellant cannot found a cause of action on 
any breach of the law but only on the breach 
of the contract. As already indicated, Statute 
151 does not lay down any procedure for 
removal of a teacher to be incorporated in the 
contract. So, Clause 5 of the contract can, in 
no event, have even a statutory flavour and 
for its breach, the appellant's remedy lay 
elsewhere.  
 
13. Besides, in order that the third exception 
to the general rule that no writ will lie to 
quash an order terminating a contract of 
service, albeit illegally, as stated in S.R. 
Tewari v. District Board, (1964) 3 SCR 55 
: AIR 1964 SC 1680], might apply, it is 
necessary that the order must be the order of 
a statutory body acting in breach of a 
mandatory obligation imposed by a statute. 
The college, or the Managing Committee in 
question, is not a statutory body and so the 
argument of Mr Setalvad that the case in 
hand will fall under the third exception 
cannot be accepted. The contention of 
counsel that this Court has sub silentio 
sanctioned the issue of a writ under Article 
226 to quash an order terminating services 
of a teacher passed by a college similarly 
situate in P.R.K. Jodh, and, therefore, the 
fact that the college or the Managing 
Committee was not a statutory body was no 
hindrance to the High Court issuing the writ 
prayed for by the appellant has no merit as 
this Court expressly stated in the judgment 
that no such contention was raised in the 
High Court and so it cannot be allowed to be 
raised in this Court.” 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 63 of 91 
 
 
52. In the case on hand, the facts are similar. Rule 
26(1) of the Affiliation Bye-laws, framed by CBSE, 
provides that each school affiliated with the Board 
shall frame Service Rules. Sub-rule (2) of it provides 
that a service contract will be entered with each 
employee as per the provision in the Education Act of 
the State/Union Territory, or as given in Appendix III, 
if not obligatory as per the State Education Act. These 
rules also provide procedures for appointments, 
probation, confirmation, recruitment, attendance 
representations, grant of leave, code of conduct, 
disciplinary procedure, penalties, etc. The model form 
of contract of service, to be executed by an employee, 
given in Appendix III, lays down that the service, 
under this agreement, will be liable to disciplinary 
action in accordance with the Rules and Regulations 
framed by the school from time to time. Only in case 
where the post is abolished or an employee intends 
to resign, Rule 31 of the Affiliation Bye-laws of the 
Board will apply. It may be noted that the above Bye-
laws do not provide for any particular procedure for 
dismissal or removal of a teacher for being 
incorporated in the contract. Nor does the model form 
of contract given in Appendix III lay down any 
particular procedure for that purpose. On the 
contrary, the disciplinary action is to be taken in 
accordance with the Rules and Regulations framed 
by the school from time to time. 
 
53. On a plain reading of these provisions, it becomes 
clear that the terms and conditions mentioned in the 
Affiliation Bye-laws may be incorporated in the 
contract to be entered into between the school and the 
employee concerned. It does not say that the terms 
and conditions have any legal force, until and unless 
they are embodied in an agreement. To put it in other 
words, the terms and conditions of service mentioned 
in Chapter VII of the Affiliation Bye-laws have no 
force of law. They become terms and conditions of 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 64 of 91 
 
service only by virtue of their being incorporated in 
the contract. Without the contract they have no vitality 
and can confer no legal rights. The terms and 
conditions mentioned in the Affiliation Bye-laws have 
no efficacy, unless they are incorporated in a 
contract. In the absence of any statutory provisions 
governing the services of the employees of the school, 
the service of Respondent 1 was purely contractual. 
A contract of personal service cannot be enforced 
specifically. Therefore, Respondent 1 cannot find a 
cause of action on any breach of the law, but only on 
the breach of the contract. That being so, the 
appellant's remedy lies elsewhere and in no case the 
writ is maintainable.  
 
54. Thus, the aforesaid order passed by this Court 
makes it very clear that in a case of retirement and in 
case of termination, no public law element is involved. 
This Court has held that a writ under Article 226 of 
the Constitution against a private educational 
institution shall be maintainable only if a public law 
element is involved and if there is no public law 
element is involved, no writ lies.  
 
55. 
In T.M.A. 
Pai 
Foundation v. State 
of 
Karnataka,  (2002) 8 SCC 481, an eleven-Judge 
Bench of this Court formulated certain points in fact 
to reconsider its earlier decision in Ahmedabad St. 
Xavier's College Society v. State of Gujarat, 
(1974) 1 SCC 717, and also Unni Krishnan, 
J.P. v. State of A.P., (1993) 4 SCC 111, regarding 
the “right of the minority institution including 
administration 
of 
the 
student 
and 
imparting 
education vis-à-vis the right of administration of the 
non-minority student”.  
 
56.  In the said case, very important points arose as 
follows:-  (T.M.A. Pai Foundation case, SCC pp.            
709-10, para 450)  

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 65 of 91 
 
 
“450. … Q.5. (c) Whether the statutory 
provisions which regulate the facets of 
administration like control over educational 
agencies, control over governing bodies, 
conditions 
of 
affiliation 
including 
recognition/withdrawal 
thereof, 
and 
appointment of staff, employees, teachers 
and 
principals 
including 
their 
service 
conditions and regulation of fees, etc. would 
interfere with the right of administration of 
minorities?  
 
A. So far as the statutory provisions 
regulating the facets of administration are 
concerned, in case of an unaided minority 
educational 
institution, 
the 
regulatory 
measure of control should be minimal and 
the conditions of recognition as well as 
conditions of affiliation to a university or 
board have to be complied with, but in the 
matter of day-to-day management, like 
appointment of staff, teaching and non-
teaching and administrative control over 
them, the management should have the 
freedom and there should not be any 
external controlling agency. However, a 
rational procedure for selection of teaching 
staff and for taking disciplinary action has to 
be evolved by the management itself. For 
redressing the grievances of such employees 
who 
are 
subjected 
to 
punishment 
or 
termination from service, a mechanism will 
have to be evolved and in our opinion, 
appropriate tribunals could be constituted, 
and till then, such tribunal could be presided 
over by a judicial officer of the rank of District 
Judge. The State or other controlling 
authorities, however, can always prescribe 
the 
minimum 
qualifications, 
salaries, 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021

experience and other conditions bearing on 
the merit of an individual for being appointed 
as a teacher of an educational institution.   
 
Regulations can be framed governing service 
conditions for teaching and other staff for 
whom aid is provided by the State without 
interfering with overall administrative control 
of 
management 
over 
the 
staff, 
government/university representative can 
be associated with the Selection Committee 
and the guidelines for selection can be laid 
down. In regard to unaided minority 
educational institutions such regulations, 
which will ensure a check over unfair 
practices and general welfare of teachers 
could be framed.” 
 
 
57. We now proceed to look into the two decisions of 
this 
Court 
in Ramesh 
Ahluwalia (supra) 
and Marwari 
Balika 
Vidyalaya (supra) 
respectively. 
 
58. In Ramesh Ahluwalia (supra), the appellant 
therein was working as an administrative officer in a 
privately run educational institution and by way of 
disciplinary proceedings, was removed from service 
by the Managing Committee of the said educational 
institution. A writ petition was filed before the learned 
Single Judge of the High Court challenging the order 
of the disciplinary authority wherein he was removed 
from service. The writ petition was ordered  to be 
dismissed in limine holding that the said educational 
institution being an unaided and a private school 
managed by the society cannot be said to be an 
instrument of the State. The appeal before the 
Division Bench also came to be dismissed.  The 
matter travelled to this Court.  

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 67 of 91 
 
 
59.   The principal argument before this Court was in 
regard to the maintainability of the writ petition 
against a private educational institution. It was 
argued on the behalf of the appellant therein that 
although a private educational institution may not fall 
within 
the 
definition 
of 
“State” 
or 
“other 
authorities/instrumentalities” of the State under 
Article 12 of the Constitution, yet a writ petition would 
be maintainable as the said educational institution 
could be said to be discharging public functions by 
imparting education. However, the learned counsel 
for the educational institution therein took a plea 
before this Court that while considering whether a 
body falling within the definition of “State”, it is 
necessary to consider whether such body is 
financially, 
functionally 
and 
administratively 
dominated by or under the control of the Government. 
It was further argued that if the control is merely 
regulatory either under a statute or otherwise, it 
would not ipso facto make the body “State” within 
Article 12 of the Constitution. On the conspectus of 
the  peculiar  facts  of  the case and the submissions 
advanced, this Court held that a writ petition would 
be maintainable if a private educational institution 
discharges 
public 
functions, 
more 
particularly 
imparting education. Even by holding so, this Court 
declined to extend any benefits to the teacher as the 
case involved disputed questions of fact. 
 
60. We take notice of the fact that in Ramesh 
Ahluwalia (supra) the attention of the Hon'ble 
Judges was not drawn to the earlier decisions of this  
Court in  K. Krishnamacharyulu (supra), Federal 
Bank  
(supra), Sushmita 
Basu v. Ballygunge 
Siksha Samity, (2006) 7 SCC 680, and Delhi 
Public School v. M.K. Gandhi (supra).

61. In Marwari Balika Vidyalaya (supra), this 
Court followed Ramesh Ahluwalia (supra) referred 
to above. 
 
62. We may say without any hesitation that 
respondent 1 herein cannot press into service the 
dictum as laid down by this Court in Marwari 
Balika Vidyalaya (supra) as the said case is 
distinguishable. The most important distinguishing 
feature of Marwari Balika Vidyalaya (supra) is 
that in the said case the removal of the teacher from 
service was subject to the approval of the State 
Government. The State Government took a specific 
stance before this Court that its approval was 
required both for the appointment as well as removal 
of the teacher. In the case on hand, indisputably the 
Government or any other agency of the Government 
has no role to play in the termination of Respondent 
1 herein. 
 
63. 
In 
context 
with 
Marwari 
Balika 
Vidyalaya (supra), we remind ourselves of Bye-law 
49(2) which provides that no order with regard to the 
imposition of major penalty shall be made by the 
disciplinary authority except after the receipt of the 
approval of the Disciplinary Committee. Thus 
unlike Marwari Balika Vidyalaya (supra) where 
approval was required of the State Government, in 
the case on hand the approval is to be obtained from 
the Disciplinary Committee of the institution. This 
distinguishing feature seems to have been overlooked 
by the High Court while passing the impugned order. 
 
64. In Marwari Balika Vidyalaya (supra), the 
school was receiving grant-in-aid to the extent of 
dearness allowance. The appointment and the 
removal, as noted above, is required to be approved 
by the District Inspector of School (Primary Education) 
and, if any action is taken dehors such mandatory 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 69 of 91 
 
provisions, the same would not come within the realm 
of private element. 
 
65. 
In Trigun 
Chand 
Thakur (supra)s, 
the 
appellant therein was appointed as a Sanskrit 
teacher and a show-cause notice was issued upon 
him on the ground that he was absent on the eve of 
Independence day and Teachers Day which resulted 
into a dismissal order passed by the Managing 
Committee of the private school. The challenge was 
made by filing a writ petition before the High Court 
which was dismissed on the ground that the writ 
petition is not maintainable against an order 
terminating the service by the Managing Committee 
of the private school. This Court held that even if the 
private school was receiving a financial aid from the 
Government, it does not make the said Managing 
Committee of the school a “State” within the meaning 
of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. 
 
66. Merely because a writ petition can be maintained 
against the private individuals discharging the public 
duties and/or public functions, the same should not 
be entertained if the enforcement is sought to be 
secured under the realm of a private law. It would not 
be safe to say that the moment the private institution 
is amenable to writ jurisdiction then every dispute 
concerning the said private institution is amenable to 
writ jurisdiction. It largely depends upon the nature 
of the dispute and the enforcement of the right by an 
individual against such institution. The right which 
purely originates from a private law cannot be 
enforced taking aid of the writ jurisdiction irrespective 
of the fact that such institution is discharging the 
public duties and/or public functions. The scope of 
the mandamus is basically limited to an enforcement 
of the public duty and, therefore, it is an ardent duty 
of the court to find out whether the nature of the duty 
comes within the peripheral of the public duty. There 
must be a public law element in any action.

67. Our present judgment would remain incomplete if 
we fail to refer to the decision of this Court 
in Ramakrishna Mission v. Kago Kunya, (2019) 
16 SCC 303. In the said case this Court considered 
all its earlier judgments on the issue. The writ petition 
was not found maintainable against the Mission 
merely for the reason that it was found running a 
hospital, thus discharging public functions/public 
duty. This Court considered the issue in reference to 
the element of public function which should be akin 
to the work performed by the State in its sovereign 
capacity. This Court took the view that every public 
function/public duty would not make a writ petition 
to be maintainable against an “authority” or a 
“person” 
referred 
under 
Article 
226 
of 
the 
Constitution of India unless the functions are such 
which are akin to the functions of the State or are 
sovereign in nature.  
 
68.  Few relevant paragraphs of the said judgment 
are 
quoted 
as 
under 
for 
ready 
reference:- 
(Ramakrishna Mission case, SCC pp. 309-11 & 313, 
paras 17-22 & 25-26) 
 
“17. The basic issue before this Court is 
whether the functions performed by the 
hospital are public functions, on the basis of 
which a writ of mandamus can lie under 
Article 226 of the Constitution. 
 
18. The hospital is a branch of the 
Ramakrishna Mission and is subject to its 
control. The Mission was established by 
Swami Vivekanand, the foremost disciple of 
Shri Ramakrishna Paramhansa. Service to 
humanity is for the organisation co-equal 
with service to God as is reflected in the 
motto “Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 71 of 91 
 
Cha”. The main object of the Ramakrishna 
Mission is to impart knowledge in and 
promote the study of Vedanta and its 
principles propounded by Shri Ramakrishna 
Paramahansa and practically illustrated by 
his own life and of comparative theology in 
its widest form. Its objects include, inter alia 
to establish, maintain, carry on and assist 
schools, 
colleges, 
universities, 
research 
institutions, libraries, hospitals and take up 
development and general welfare activities 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
underprivileged/backward/tribal people of 
society without any discrimination. These 
activities are voluntary, charitable and non-
profit making in nature. The activities 
undertaken by the Mission, a non-profit 
entity are not closely related to those 
performed by the State in its sovereign 
capacity nor do they partake of the nature of 
a public duty. 
 
19. The Governing Body of the Mission is 
constituted by members of the Board of 
Trustees of Ramakrishna Math and is vested 
with the power and authority to manage the 
organisation. The properties and funds of the 
Mission and its management vest in the 
Governing Body. Any person can become a 
member of the Mission if elected by the 
Governing Body. Members on roll form the 
quorum of the annual general meetings. The 
Managing Committee comprises of members 
appointed by the Governing Body for 
managing the affairs of the Mission. Under 
the Memorandum of Association and Rules 
and Regulations of the Mission, there is no 
governmental control in the functioning, 
administration and day-to-day management 
of the Mission. The conditions of service of 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 72 of 91 
 
the employees of the hospital are governed 
by service rules which are framed by the 
Mission without the intervention of any 
governmental body.  
 
20. In coming to the conclusion that the 
appellants fell within the description of an 
authority under Article 226, the High Court 
placed a considerable degree of reliance on 
the judgment of a two-Judge Bench of this 
Court 
in Andi 
Mukta [Andi 
Mukta 
Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas Swami 
Suvarna 
Jayanti 
Mahotsav 
Smarak 
Trust v. V.R. Rudani, (1989) 2 SCC 691 : 
AIR 1989 SC 1607]. Andi Mukta [Andi 
Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas 
Swami 
Suvarna 
Jayanti 
Mahotsav 
Smarak Trust v. V.R. Rudani, (1989) 2 
SCC 691 : AIR 1989 SC 1607] was a case 
where a public trust was running a college 
which was affiliated to Gujarat University, a 
body governed by the State legislation. The 
teachers of the University and all its 
affiliated colleges were governed, insofar as 
their pay scales were concerned, by the 
recommendations of the University Grants 
Commission. A dispute over pay scales 
raised by the association representing the 
teachers of the University had been the 
subject-matter of an award of the Chancellor, 
which was accepted by the Government as 
well as by the University. The management 
of the college, in question, decided to close it 
down without prior approval. A writ petition 
was instituted before the High Court for the 
enforcement of the right of the teachers to 
receive their salaries and terminal benefits in 
accordance with the governing provisions. In 
that context, this Court dealt with the issue 
as to whether the management of the college 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 73 of 91 
 
was amenable to the writ jurisdiction. A 
number of circumstances weighed in the 
ultimate decision of this Court, including the 
following: 
 
20.1. The trust was managing an 
affiliated college. 
20.2. The college was in receipt of 
government aid. 
20.3. The aid of the Government played a 
major role in the control, management 
and work of the educational institution.  
20.4. Aided institutions, in a similar 
manner 
as 
government 
institutions, 
discharge a public function of imparting 
education to students. 
20.5. All aided institutions are governed 
by the rules and regulations of the 
affiliating University. 
20.6. 
Their 
activities 
are 
closely 
supervised by the University. 
20.7. Employment in such institutions is 
hence, not devoid of a public character 
and is governed by the decisions taken 
by the University which are binding on 
the management. 
 
21. It was in the above circumstances that this 
Court came to the conclusion that the service 
conditions of the academic staff do not partake of 
a private character, but are governed by a right-
duty relationship between the staff and the 
management. A breach of the duty, it was held, 
would be amenable to the remedy of a writ of 
mandamus. While the Court recognised that “the 
fast expanding maze of bodies affecting rights of 
people 
cannot 
be 
put 
into 
watertight 
compartments”, it laid down two exceptions 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 74 of 91 
 
where the remedy of mandamus would not be 
available:- (SCC p. 698, para 15)  
 
‘15. If the rights are purely of a private 
character no mandamus can issue. If the 
management of the college is purely a 
private 
body 
with 
no 
public 
duty 
mandamus will not lie. These are two 
exceptions to mandamus.’ 
 
22. Following the decision in Andi Mukta [Andi 
Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas 
Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak 
Trust v. V.R. Rudani, (1989) 2 SCC 691 : AIR 
1989 SC 1607] , this Court has had the occasion to 
re-visit the underlying principles in successive 
decisions. This has led to the evolution of principles 
to determine what constitutes a “public duty” and 
“public function” and whether the writ of 
mandamus would be available to an individual 
who seeks to enforce her right.

25. A similar view was taken in Ramesh 
Ahluwalia v. State of Punjab, (2012) 12 SCC 
331 : (2013) 3 SCC (L&S) 456 : 4 SCEC 715] , 
where a two-Judge Bench of this Court held that a 
private body can be held to be amenable to the 
jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 
when it performs public functions which are 
normally expected to be performed by the State or 
its authorities.  
 
26. In Federal Bank Ltd. v. Sagar Thomas, 
(2003) 10 SCC 733] , this Court analysed the 
earlier judgments of this Court and provided a 
classification of entities against whom a writ 
petition may be maintainable : (SCC p. 748, para 
18) 
 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 75 of 91 
 
‘18. From the decisions referred to above, the 
position that emerges is that a writ petition 
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India 
may be maintainable against (i) the State 
(Government); 
(ii) 
an 
authority; 
(iii) 
a 
statutory body; (iv) an instrumentality or 
agency of the State; (v) a company which is 
financed and owned by the State; (vi) a 
private body run substantially on State 
funding; (vii) a private body discharging 
public duty or positive obligation of public 
nature; and (viii) a person or a body under 
liability to discharge any function under any 
statute, to compel it to perform such a 
statutory function.’ ” 
  
69. 
The 
aforesaid 
decision 
of 
this 
Court 
in Ramakrishna 
Mission (supra) 
came 
to 
be 
considered exhaustively by a Full Bench of the High 
Court 
of 
Allahabad 
in Uttam 
Chand 
Rawat v. State of U.P. reported in (2021) 6 ALL LJ 
393 (FB), wherein the Full Bench was called upon to 
answer the following question:- (Uttam Chand Rawat 
case, SCC OnLine All para 1) 
 
“1. …(i) Whether the element of public 
function and public duty inherent in the 
enterprise that an educational institution 
undertakes, conditions of service of teachers, 
whose functions are a sine qua non to the 
discharge of that public function or duty, can 
be regarded as governed by the private law 
of contract and with no remedy available 
under Article 226 of the Constitution?” 
 
70. The Full Bench proceeded to answer the aforesaid 
question as under:- ((Uttam Chand Rawat case, SCC 
OnLine All paras 16-20) 
 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 76 of 91 
 
“16. The substance of the discussion made 
above is that a writ petition would be 
maintainable against the authority or the 
person which may be a private body, if it 
discharges 
public 
function/public 
duty, 
which is otherwise primary function of the 
State referred in the judgment of the 
Supreme 
Court 
in Ramakrishna 
Mission (supra) and the issue under public 
law is involved. The aforesaid twin test has 
to be satisfied for entertaining writ petition 
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.  
 
17. From the discussion aforesaid and in the 
light of the judgments referred above, a writ 
petition under Article 226 of the Constitution 
would be maintainable against (i) the 
Government; (ii) an authority; (iii) a statutory 
body; (iv) an instrumentality or agency of the 
State; (v) a company which is financed and 
owned by the State; (vi) a private body run 
substantially on State funding; (vii) a private 
body discharging public duty or positive 
obligation of public nature; and (viii) a person 
or a body under liability to discharge any 
function under any statute, to compel it to 
perform such a statutory function.  
 
18. There is thin line between “public 
functions” 
and 
“private 
functions” 
discharged by a person or a private 
body/authority. The writ petition would be 
maintainable only after determining the 
nature of the duty to be enforced by the body 
or authority rather than identifying the 
authority against whom it is sought. 
 
19. It is also that even if a person or 
authority is discharging public function or 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 77 of 91 
 
public duty, the writ petition would be 
maintainable under Article 226 of the 
Constitution, if Court is satisfied that action 
under challenge falls in the domain of public 
law, as distinguished from private law. The 
twin tests for maintainability of writ are as 
follows: 
1. The person or authority is discharging 
public duty/public functions. 
2. Their action under challenge falls in 
domain of public law and not under common 
law.  
 
20. 
The 
writ 
petition 
would 
not 
be 
maintainable against an authority or a person 
merely for the reason that it has been created 
under the statute or is to be governed by 
regulatory provisions. It would not even in a 
case where aid is received unless it is 
substantial in nature. The control of the State 
is another issue to hold a writ petition to be 
maintainable against an authority or a 
person.”                               (Emphasis supplied) 
 
71. We owe a duty to consider one relevant aspect of 
the matter. Although this aspect which we want to 
take notice of has not been highlighted by 
Respondent 1, yet we must look into the same. We 
have referred to the CBSE Affiliation Bye-laws in the 
earlier part of our judgment. Appendix IV of the 
Affiliation Bye-laws is with respect to the minority 
institutions. Clause 6 of Appendix IV is with respect 
to the disciplinary control over the staff in a minority 
educational institution. We take notice of the fact that 
in Clause 6, the State has the regulatory power to 
safeguard the interests of their employees and their 
service conditions including the procedure for 
punishment to be imposed.  
 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 78 of 91 
 
72. For the sake of convenience and at the cost of 
repetition, we quote Clause 6 once again as under: 
 
“6. Disciplinary control over staff in 
Minority 
EducationalInstitutions.—While 
the managements 
should 
exercise 
the 
disciplinary control over staff, it must be ensured 
that they hold an inquiry and follow a fair 
procedure before punishment is given. With a 
view to preventing the possible misuse of power 
by the management of the Minority Educational 
Institutions, the State has the regulatory power to 
safeguard the interests of their employees and 
their service conditions including procedure for 
punishment to be imposed.”  (Emphasis supplied) 
 
73. It could be argued that as the State has regulatory 
power to safeguard the interests of the employees 
serving with the minority institutions, any action or 
decision taken by such institution is amenable to writ 
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. 
 
74. In the aforesaid context, we may only say that 
merely because the State Government has the 
regulatory power, the same, by itself, would not 
confer any such status upon the institution (school) 
nor put any such obligations upon it which may be 
enforced through issue of a writ under Article 226 of 
the Constitution. In this regard, we may refer to and 
rely upon the decision of this Court in Federal 
Bank (supra). While deciding whether a private bank 
that is regulated by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 
discharges any public function, this Court held thus:- 
(Ramakrishna Mission case, SCC pp. 315-16, paras 
33-35) 
 
“33. … ‘33… ‘in our view, a private company 
carrying 
on 
banking 
business 
as 
a 
scheduled bank, cannot be termed as an 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 79 of 91 
 
institution or a company carrying on any 
statutory or public duty. A private body or a 
person may be amenable to writ jurisdiction 
only where it may become necessary to 
compel such body or association to enforce 
any statutory obligations or such obligations 
of public nature casting positive obligation 
upon it. We do not find such conditions are 
fulfilled in respect of a private company 
carrying 
on 
a 
commercial 
activity 
of 
banking. Merely regulatory provisions to 
ensure such activity carried on by private 
bodies work within a discipline, do not confer 
any such status upon the company nor put 
any such obligation upon it which may be 
enforced through issue of a writ under Article 
226 of the Constitution. Present is a case of 
disciplinary action being taken against its 
employee by the appellant Bank. The 
respondent's service with the Bank stands 
terminated. The action of the Bank was 
challenged by the respondent by filing a writ 
petition under Article 226 of the Constitution 
of India. The respondent is not trying to 
enforce any statutory duty on the part of the 
Bank.’  (Federal Bank case, SCC pp. 758-59, 
para 33) 
 
34. Thus, contracts of a purely private nature 
would not be subject to writ jurisdiction 
merely by reason of the fact that they are 
structured by statutory provisions. The only 
exception to this principle arises in a 
situation where the contract of service is 
governed or regulated by a statutory 
provision. 
Hence, 
for 
instance, 
in K.K. 
Saksena [K.K. 
Saksena v. International 
Commission on Irrigation & Drainage, (2015) 
4 SCC 670 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 654 : (2015) 
2 SCC (L&S) 119] this Court held that when 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 80 of 91 
 
an employee is a workman governed by the 
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, it constitutes 
an exception to the general principle that a 
contract of personal service is not capable of 
being specifically enforced or performed. 
 
35. It is of relevance to note that the Act was 
enacted to provide for the regulation and 
registration of clinical establishments with a 
view to prescribe minimum standards of 
facilities and services. The Act, inter alia, 
stipulates conditions to be satisfied by 
clinical 
establishments 
for 
registration. 
However, the Act does not govern contracts 
of service entered into by the hospital with 
respect to its employees. These fall within 
the ambit of purely private contracts, against 
which writ jurisdiction cannot lie. The 
sanctity 
of 
this 
distinction 
must 
be 
preserved.”   
             (Emphasis in original and supplied) 
 
41.   The final conclusion drawn in the said decision is 
reproduced herein:- 
 “75. We may sum up our final conclusions as under:- 
75.1. An application under Article 226 of the 
Constitution is maintainable against a person or a 
body discharging public duties or public functions. 
The public duty cast may be either statutory or 
otherwise and where it is otherwise, the body or the 
person must be shown to owe that duty or obligation 
to the public involving the public law element. 
Similarly, for ascertaining the discharge of public 
function, it must be established that the body or the 
person was seeking to achieve the same for the 
collective benefit of the public or a section of it and 
the authority to do so must be accepted by the public. 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 81 of 91 
 
75.2. Even if it be assumed that an educational 
institution  is   imparting   public   duty,     the     act 
complained of must have a direct nexus with the 
discharge of public duty. It is indisputably a public 
law action which confers a right upon the aggrieved 
to invoke the extraordinary writ jurisdiction under 
Article 226 for a prerogative writ. Individual wrongs 
or breach of mutual contracts without having any 
public element as its integral part cannot be rectified 
through a writ petition under Article 226. Wherever 
Courts 
have 
intervened 
in 
their 
exercise 
of 
jurisdiction under Article 226, either the service 
conditions 
were 
regulated 
by 
the 
statutory 
provisions or the employer had the status of “State” 
within the expansive definition under Article 12 or it 
was found that the action complained of has public 
law element. 
75.3.  It must be consequently held that while a body 
may be discharging a public function or performing a 
public duty and thus its actions becoming amenable 
to judicial review by a constitutional court, its 
employees would not have the right to invoke the 
powers of the High Court conferred by Article 226 in 
respect of matter relating to service where they are 
not governed or controlled by the statutory 
provisions. An educational institution may perform 
myriad functions touching various facets of public life 
and in the societal sphere. While such of those 
functions as would fall within the domain of a “public 
function” or “public duty” be undisputedly open to 
challenge and scrutiny under Article 226 of the 
Constitution, the actions or decisions taken solely 
within the confines of an ordinary contract of service, 
having no statutory force or backing, cannot be 
recognised as being amenable to challenge under 
Article 226 of the Constitution. In the absence of the 
service conditions being controlled or governed by 
statutory provisions, the matter would remain in the 
realm of an ordinary contract of service.

75.4.  Even if it be perceived that imparting education 
by private unaided school is a public duty within the 
expanded expression of the term, an employee of a 
non-teaching staff engaged by the school for the 
purpose 
of 
its 
administration 
or 
internal 
management is only an agency created by it. It is 
immaterial whether “A” or “B” is employed by school 
to discharge that duty. In any case, the terms of 
employment of contract between a school and non-
teaching staff cannot and should not be construed to 
be an inseparable part of the obligation to impart 
education. This is particularly in respect to the 
disciplinary proceedings that may be initiated 
against a particular employee. It is only where the 
removal of an employee of non-teaching staff is 
regulated by some statutory provisions, its violation 
by the employer in contravention of law may be 
interfered with by the Court. But such interference 
will be on the ground of breach of law and not on the 
basis of interference in discharge of public duty. 
75.5.  From the pleadings in the original writ petition, 
it is apparent that no element of any public law is 
agitated or otherwise made out. In other words, the 
action challenged has no public element and writ of 
mandamus cannot be issued as the action was 
essentially of a private character. 
76.  In view of the aforesaid discussion, we hold that 
the learned Single Judge of the High Court was 
justified in taking the view that the original writ 
application filed by Respondent 1 herein under Article 
226 of the Constitution is not maintainable. The 
appeal court could be said to have committed an error 
in taking a contrary view.” 
 
42. 
In view of the aforesaid, nothing more is required to be 
discussed in the present appeals.  We are of the view that the 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 83 of 91 
 
High Court committed an egregious error in entertaining the writ 
petition filed by the respondents herein holding that the 
appellant society is a “State” within Article 12 of the Constitution. 
Undoubtedly, the school run by the Appellant Society imparts 
education. Imparting education involves public duty and 
therefore public law element could also be said to be involved. 
However, the relationship between the respondents herein and 
the appellant society is that of an employee and a private 
employer arising out of a private contract. If there is a breach of 
a covenant of a private contract, the same does not touch any 
public law element.  The school cannot be said to be discharging 
any public duty in connection with the employment of the 
respondents.  
 
ii. 
Doctrine of Legitimate Expectation 
 
43. 
During the course of the arguments, a submission was 
canvassed that the respondents were under a legitimate 
expectation that their service conditions and salary would not be 
unilaterally 
altered 
by 
the 
appellant 
society 
to 
their 
disadvantage. Thus, as the respondents were neither consulted 
with nor taken in confidence by the appellant society before 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 84 of 91 
 
effecting the changes in their service conditions, it amounted to 
a breach of their legitimate expectation, thereby making it a fit 
case for the exercise of writ jurisdiction by the High Court.   
44. 
The doctrine of legitimate expectation was also referred to 
and relied upon by the single Judge of the High Court as one of 
the reasons to allow the writ petition filed by the respondents. 
The relevant observations made by the single Judge in the 
judgment 
and 
order 
dated 
05.08.2014 
are 
reproduced 
hereinbelow:- 
“28. We also have to appreciate the "legitimate 
expectations" of the petitioners who expect equity, 
fairplay and justice, from a public authority which 
respondent nos. 2, 3 and 7 indeed are and, therefore, 
they must meet such standards as a public authority 
ought to 15 have. The new management of the School, 
including respondent no.2, 3 and 7 are hereby 
directed not to change or vary the conditions of the 
petitioners to their disadvantage.” 
 
45. 
Before parting with the matter, we deem it necessary to 
answer the aforesaid submission of the respondents. This Court 
in Union of India v. Hindustan Development Corporation 
reported in (1993) 3 SCC 499 enunciated that the doctrine of 
legitimate expectation is a creature of public law aimed at 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 85 of 91 
 
combating 
arbitrariness 
in 
executive 
action 
by 
public 
authorities. It held thus:-  
“Time is a three-fold present: the present as we 
experience it, the past as a present memory and 
future as a present expectation. For legal purposes, 
the expectation cannot be the same as anticipation. It 
is different from a wish, a desire or a hope nor can it 
amount to a claim or demand on the ground of a right. 
However earnest and sincere a wish, a desire or a 
hope may be and however confidently one may look 
to them to be fulfilled, they by themselves cannot 
amount to an assertable expectation and a mere 
disappointment does not attract legal consequences. 
A pious hope even leading to a moral obligation 
cannot amount to a legitimate expectation. The 
legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only if it 
is founded on the sanction of law or custom or an 
established procedure followed in regular and 
natural sequence. Again, it is distinguishable from a 
genuine expectation. Such expectation should be 
justifiably legitimate and protectable. Every such 
legitimate expectation does not by itself fructify into a 
right and therefore it does not amount to a right in the 
conventional sense.” 
 
46. 
In Ram Pravesh Singh v. State of Bihar reported in 
(2006) 8 SCC 381, this Court explained the doctrine of legitimate 
expectation in details as follows:-  
“What is legitimate expectation? Obviously, it is not a 
legal right. It is an expectation of a benefit, relief or 
remedy, that may ordinarily flow from a promise or 
established practice. The term “established practice” 
refers to a regular, consistent, predictable and certain 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 86 of 91 
 
conduct, process or activity of the decision-making 
authority. The expectation should be legitimate, that 
is, reasonable, logical and valid. Any expectation 
which is based on sporadic or casual or random acts, 
or which is unreasonable, illogical or invalid cannot 
be a legitimate expectation. Not being a right, it is not 
enforceable as such. It is a concept fashioned by the 
courts, for judicial review of administrative action. It 
is procedural in character based on the requirement 
of a higher degree of fairness in administrative action, 
as a consequence of the promise made, or practice 
established. In short, a person can be said to have a 
“legitimate expectation” of a particular treatment, if 
any representation or promise is made by an 
authority, either expressly or impliedly, or if the 
regular and consistent past practice of the authority 
gives room for such expectation in the normal course. 
As a ground for relief, the efficacy of the doctrine is 
rather weak as its slot is just above “fairness in 
action” but far below “promissory estoppel”. It may 
only entitle an expectant : (a) to an opportunity to 
show cause before the expectation is dashed; or (b) to 
an explanation as to the cause for denial. In 
appropriate cases, the courts may grant a direction 
requiring the authority to follow the promised 
procedure or established practice. A legitimate 
expectation, even when made out, does not always 
entitle the expectant to a relief. Public interest, change 
in policy, conduct of the expectant or any other valid 
or bona fide reason given by the decision-maker, may 
be sufficient to negative the “legitimate expectation”. 
The doctrine of legitimate expectation based on 
established practice (as contrasted from legitimate 
expectation based on a promise), can be invoked only 
by someone who has dealings or transactions or 
negotiations with an authority, on which such 
established practice has a bearing, or by someone 
who has a recognised legal relationship with the 
authority. A total stranger unconnected with the 
authority or a person who had no previous dealings 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 87 of 91 
 
with the authority and who has not entered into any 
transaction or negotiations with the authority, cannot 
invoke the doctrine of legitimate expectation, merely 
on the ground that the authority has a general 
obligation to act fairly.” 
 
47. 
In Jitender Kumar v. State of Haryana reported in 
(2008) 2 SCC 161, this Court, while differentiating between 
legitimate expectation on the one hand and anticipation, wishes 
and desire on the other, observed thus:- 
“A legitimate expectation is not the same thing as an 
anticipation. It is distinct and different from a desire 
and hope. It is based on a right. [See Chanchal Goyal 
(Dr.) v. State of Rajasthan [(2003) 3 SCC 485 : 2003 
SCC (L&S) 322] and Union of India v. Hindustan 
Development Corpn. [(1993) 3 SCC 499] It is 
grounded in the rule of law as requiring regularity, 
predictability and certainty in the Government's 
dealings with the public. We have no doubt that the 
doctrine of legitimate expectation operates both in 
procedural and substantive matters.” 
 
48. 
A reading of the aforesaid decisions brings forth the 
following features 
regarding the doctrine of legitimate 
expectation:  
a. 
First, legitimate expectation must be based on a 
right as opposed to a mere hope, wish or anticipation; 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 88 of 91 
 
b. 
Secondly, legitimate expectation must arise either 
from an express or implied promise; or a consistent past 
practice or custom followed by an authority in its 
dealings; 
c. 
Thirdly, expectation which is based on sporadic or 
casual or random acts, or which is unreasonable, illogical 
or invalid cannot be treated as a legitimate expectation; 
d. 
Fourthly, 
legitimate 
expectation 
operates 
in 
relation to both substantive and procedural matters;  
e. 
Fifthly, legitimate expectation operates in the 
realm of public law, that is, a plea of legitimate action can 
be taken only when a public authority breaches a 
promise or deviates from a consistent past practice, 
without any reasonable basis.  
f. 
Sixthly, a plea of legitimate expectation based on 
past practice can only be taken by someone who has 
dealings, or negotiations with a public authority. It 
cannot be invoked by a total stranger to the authority 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 89 of 91 
 
merely on the ground that the authority has a duty to act 
fairly generally.    
49. 
The aforesaid features, although not exhaustive in nature, 
are sufficient to help us in deciding the applicability of the 
doctrine of legitimate expectation to the facts of the case at hand. 
It is clear that legitimate expectation, jurisprudentially, was a 
device created in order to maintain a check on arbitrariness in 
state action. It does not extend to and cannot govern the 
operation of contracts between private parties, wherein the 
doctrine of promissory estoppel holds the field.  
50. 
We have discussed in detail in preceding paragraphs that 
even if the function being performed by a private educational 
institution in imparting education may be considered as a public 
function, the relationship between the administration of such an 
institution and its employees remains a contractual one, falling 
within the ambit of private law.  
51. 
Nothing has been placed on record by the respondents to 
show that any express or implied promise was made by the 
appellant regarding keeping their salary and service conditions 
intact. There have been no past negotiations or dealings between 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 90 of 91 
 
the respondents and the appellant society as the dispute arose 
as soon as the appellant took over the administration of the 
school. Moreover, there is no statutory obligation on the 
appellant society which requires that the salaries and allowances 
of the respondents are to be kept at par with what is payable to 
teachers of Government institutions. Lastly, the appellant 
society, for the purposes of its relationship with its employees, 
cannot be regarded as a public or Government authority.  
52. 
We are of the view that for all the aforesaid reasons, the 
doctrine of legitimate expectation will have no applicability to the 
facts of the present case. The submission of the respondents in 
that regard is thus answered accordingly.   
 
H. CONCLUSION 
 
53. 
In the result, the appeals succeed and are hereby allowed.  
The impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is 
hereby set aside.  
54. 
Although we have set aside the impugned judgment and 
order passed by the High Court, yet having regard to the 

 
Civil Appeals @ SLP (C) Nos. 3138-3141/2021 & 3133-3137/2021 
  
Page 91 of 91 
 
submissions made on behalf of the appellants as recorded in 
paragraph 6 of the order dated 15.02.2021 (extracted in 
paragraph 4 herein above) as also the fact that all the 
respondents as on date are serving with the appellant society, 
they shall continue to serve on the terms and conditions as 
stipulated by the appellant society. The appellant society shall 
not discharge the respondents from service. 
55. 
There shall be no order as to costs.
