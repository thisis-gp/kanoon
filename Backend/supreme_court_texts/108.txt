Whether a Director who has resigned from such position and which fact 
stands recorded in the books as per the relevant rules and statutory provisions, can 
be held liable for certain negotiable instruments, failing realization, is the sole 
short and common question that this Court must consider in these appeals arising

out of the judgment and order dated 6th April, 2022 in CRLOP No.34923 of 2019; 
and 8th April, 2022  in CRLOP No.34248 of 2019. 
3. 
A brief conspectus of facts for adjudication of the present lis is:- 
(a) The appellants in both the appeals were Directors in the Respondent-
Company 
and had resigned from such Directorship on 
9th 
December,20131 and 12th March, 20142 respectively; 
(b) Form 32 in accordance with Sections 303(2), 264(2), 266(1)(a), and 
266(1)(b)(iii) of the Companies Act, 1956, in respect thereof stood 
accepted on 9th December, 2013 and 20th March, 2014  respectively.  The 
relevant records stood rectified, incorporating these changes; 
(c) The appellants, namely, Rajesh Viren Shah and Sanjay Babulal Bhutada 
in Crl.Appeal Nos…..@ SLP(Crl)No.6905 and SLP(Crl)No.7050 of 
2022, respectively, were arrayed as accused in a complaint filed under 
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 18813 in relation to three 
cheques 
bearing 
nos. 
002535 
for 
Rs.7,10,085/-; 
002777 
for 
Rs.1,85,09,054; and 002791 for Rs.10,00,000/-, all dated 22nd March, 
2014, by the Company respondent herein against M/s MIEL e-Security 
Private Limited and its Directors, with one Mr. Narayanan Kutty Nair,

Managing Director, being arrayed as  A-2, and A-3 to A-7 being its 
Directors, including the appellants who were arrayed as A-4 and A-6 
respectively.   
(d) With the dishonouring of the cheque on presentation on account of 
insufficient funds the complainant-respondent after serving statutory 
notice dated 11th April, 2014 preferred a complaint under Sections 200 
and 191A Code of Criminal Procedure, 19734 read with Section 144 of 
the N.I. Act, seeking quashing of such an action initiated by the 
respondent herein, the appellant(s) preferred a petition under Section 482 
of the Cr.PC which stands dismissed by the impugned order. 
 
4. 
The position of law as to the liability that can be fastened upon a Director for 
non-realisation of a cheque is no longer res integra. Before adverting to the 
judicial position, we must also take note of the statutory provision - Section 141 of 
the N.I. Act, which states that every person who at the time of the offence was 
responsible for the affairs/conduct of the business of the company, shall be held 
liable and proceeded against under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, with exception 
thereto being that such an act, if done without his knowledge or after him having 
taken all necessary precautions, would not be held liable.  However, if it is proved 
that any act of a company is proved to have been done with the connivance or 
 
4 ‘Cr.PC’ 

 
4|SLP (Crl) 6905 & 7050 of 2022 
 
consent or may be attributable to (i) a director; (ii) a manager;     (iii) a secretary; 
or (iv) any other officer – they shall be deemed to be guilty of that offence and 
shall be proceeded against accordingly. 
5. 
Coming to the judicial position, we notice a judgment of this Court in 
Monaben Ketanbhai Shah  v.  State of Gujarat5 wherein it was observed that:- 
“…The primary responsibility is on the complainant to make 
necessary averments in the complaint so as to make the accused 
vicariously liable.  For fastening the criminal liability, there is no 
presumption that every partner knows about the transaction.  The 
obligation of the appellants to prove that at the time the offence was 
committed they were not in charge of and were not responsible to the 
firm for the conduct of the business of the firm, would arise only 
when the complainant makes necessary averments in the complaint 
and establishes that fact…” 
 
 
6. 
A Bench of three learned Judges in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  v. Neeta 
Bhalla and Anr.6 observed:- 
“18.   To sum up, there is almost unanimous judicial opinion that 
necessary averments ought to be contained in a complaint before a 
person can be subjected to criminal process. …A clear case should 
be spelled out in the complaint made against the person sought to 
be made liable.  Section 141 of the Act contains the requirements 
for making a person liable under the said provision.  That the 
respondent falls within the parameters of Section 141 has to be 
spelled out…” 
 
7. 
We also notice this Court to have observed, in regards to the exercise of the 
inherent powers under Section 482, CrPC, in cases involving negotiable 
instruments that interference would not be called for, in the absence of “some 
 
5 (2004) 7 SCC 15 
6 (2005) 8 SCC 89 

 
5|SLP (Crl) 6905 & 7050 of 2022 
 
unimpeachable, incontrovertible evidence which is beyond suspicion or doubt or 
totally acceptable circumstances which may clearly indicate that the Director 
could not have been concerned with the issuance of cheques and asking him to 
stand the trial would be abuse of process of Court.” This principle as held in 
S.M.S Pharmaceuticals (supra) was followed in Ashutosh Ashok Parasrampuriya 
and Anr. v. Gharrkul Industries Pvt. Ltd. and Others7. 
8. 
We find the High Court, in the impugned order to have elaborately discussed 
the principles of law in regard to the quashing of such proceedings but, however, 
not dealt with the factual matrix.  Ex facie, we find that the complainant has not 
placed any materials on record indicating complicity of the present appellant(s) in 
the alleged crime.  Particularly, when the appellant(s) had no role in the issuance of 
the instrument, which is evident from Form 32 (Exh.P.59) issued much prior to the 
date on which the cheque was drawn and presented for realisation. 
9. 
The veracity of Form-32 has neither been disputed by the Respondent nor 
has the act of resignation simpliciter been questioned.  As such, the basis on which 
liability is sought to be fastened upon the instant appellant(s) is rendered 
questionable.   
10. 
The record reveals the resignations to have taken place on 9th December 
2013 and 12th March 2014.  Equally, we find the cheques regarding which the 
 
7 2021 SCC OnLine SC 915 

 
6|SLP (Crl) 6905 & 7050 of 2022 
 
dispute has travelled up the courts to have been issued on 22nd March 2014.  The 
latter is clearly, after the appellant(s) have severed their ties with the Respondent-
Company and, therefore, can in no way be responsible for the conduct of business 
at the relevant time. Therefore, we have no hesitation in holding that they ought to 
be then entitled to be discharged from prosecution.   
11. 
In this view of the matter, the judgments captioned above of the High Court 
of Judicature at Madras, deserve to be set aside.  Accordingly, all criminal 
proceedings pertaining to the instant appellant(s) arising out of the complaints filed 
by the respondent herein are quashed.  
12. 
The appeal(s) are therefore allowed in the above terms.  Pending 
application(s) if any, shall stand disposed of.
